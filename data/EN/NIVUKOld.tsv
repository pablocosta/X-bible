NIVUK	Genesis	1	1	In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	2	Now the earth was formless and empty , darkness was over the surface of the deep , and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	3	And God said , ‘ Let there be light , ’ and there was light .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	4	God saw that the light was good , and he separated the light from the darkness .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	5	God called the light ‘ day ’ , and the darkness he called ‘ night ’ . And there was evening , and there was morning – the first day .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	6	And God said , ‘ Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	1	7	So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it . And it was so .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	8	God called the vault ‘ sky ’ . And there was evening , and there was morning – the second day .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	9	And God said , ‘ Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place , and let dry ground appear. ’ And it was so .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	10	God called the dry ground ‘ land ’ , and the gathered waters he called ‘ seas ’ . And God saw that it was good .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	11	Then God said , ‘ Let the land produce vegetation : seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it , according to their various kinds. ’ And it was so .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	12	The land produced vegetation : plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds . And God saw that it was good .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	13	And there was evening , and there was morning – the third day .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	14	And God said , ‘ Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night , and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times , and days and years ,
NIVUK	Genesis	1	15	and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth. ’ And it was so .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	16	God made two great lights – the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night . He also made the stars .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	17	God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth ,
NIVUK	Genesis	1	18	to govern the day and the night , and to separate light from darkness . And God saw that it was good .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	19	And there was evening , and there was morning – the fourth day .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	20	And God said , ‘ Let the water teem with living creatures , and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	1	21	So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it , according to their kinds , and every winged bird according to its kind . And God saw that it was good .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	22	God blessed them and said , ‘ Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas , and let the birds increase on the earth. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	1	23	And there was evening , and there was morning – the fifth day .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	24	And God said , ‘ Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds : the livestock , the creatures that move along the ground , and the wild animals , each according to its kind. ’ And it was so .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	25	God made the wild animals according to their kinds , the livestock according to their kinds , and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds . And God saw that it was good .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	26	Then God said , ‘ Let us make mankind in our image , in our likeness , so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky , over the livestock and all the wild animals , [ a ] and over all the creatures that move along the ground. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	1	27	So God created mankind in his own image , in the image of God he created them ; male and female he created them .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	28	God blessed them and said to them , ‘ Be fruitful and increase in number ; fill the earth and subdue it . Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	1	29	Then God said , ‘ I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it . They will be yours for food .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	30	And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground – everything that has the breath of life in it – I give every green plant for food. ’ And it was so .
NIVUK	Genesis	1	31	God saw all that he had made , and it was very good . And there was evening , and there was morning – the sixth day .

NIVUK	Genesis	3	2	The woman said to the snake , ‘ We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden ,
NIVUK	Genesis	3	4	‘ You will not certainly die , ’ the snake said to the woman .
NIVUK	Genesis	3	5	‘ For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened , and you will be like God , knowing good and evil. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	3	6	When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye , and also desirable for gaining wisdom , she took some and ate it . She also gave some to her husband , who was with her , and he ate it .
NIVUK	Genesis	3	7	Then the eyes of both of them were opened , and they realised that they were naked ; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves .
NIVUK	Genesis	3	8	Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day , and they hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden .
NIVUK	Genesis	3	9	But the Lord God called to the man , ‘ Where are you ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	3	10	He answered , ‘ I heard you in the garden , and I was afraid because I was naked ; so I hid. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	3	11	And he said , ‘ Who told you that you were naked ? Have you eaten from the tree from which I commanded you not to eat ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	3	12	The man said , ‘ The woman you put here with me – she gave me some fruit from the tree , and I ate it. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	3	13	Then the Lord God said to the woman , ‘ What is this you have done ? ’ The woman said , ‘ The snake deceived me , and I ate. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	3	14	So the Lord God said to the snake , ‘ Because you have done this , ‘ Cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals ! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life .
NIVUK	Genesis	3	15	And I will put enmity between you and the woman , and between your offspring [ a ] and hers ; he will crush [ b ] your head , and you will strike his heel. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	3	16	To the woman he said , ‘ I will make your pains in childbearing very severe ; with painful labour you will give birth to children . Your desire will be for your husband , and he will rule over you. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	3	17	To Adam he said , ‘ Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you , “ You must not eat from it , ” ‘ Cursed is the ground because of you ; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life .
NIVUK	Genesis	3	18	It will produce thorns and thistles for you , and you will eat the plants of the field .
NIVUK	Genesis	3	19	By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground , since from it you were taken ; for dust you are and to dust you will return. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	3	20	Adam [ c ] named his wife Eve , [ d ] because she would become the mother of all the living .
NIVUK	Genesis	3	21	The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them .
NIVUK	Genesis	3	22	And the Lord God said , ‘ The man has now become like one of us , knowing good and evil . He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat , and live for ever. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	3	23	So the Lord God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken .

NIVUK	Genesis	4	3	In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord .
NIVUK	Genesis	4	5	but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favour . So Cain was very angry , and his face was downcast .
NIVUK	Genesis	4	6	Then the Lord said to Cain , ‘ Why are you angry ? Why is your face downcast ?
NIVUK	Genesis	4	7	If you do what is right , will you not be accepted ? But if you do not do what is right , sin is crouching at your door ; it desires to have you , but you must rule over it. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	4	8	Now Cain said to his brother Abel , ‘ Let ’ s go out to the field. ’ [ d ] While they were in the field , Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him .
NIVUK	Genesis	4	9	Then the Lord said to Cain , ‘ Where is your brother Abel ? ’ ‘ I don ’ t know , ’ he replied . ‘ Am I my brother ’ s keeper ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	4	10	The Lord said , ‘ What have you done ? Listen ! Your brother ’ s blood cries out to me from the ground .

NIVUK	Genesis	8	2	Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed , and the rain had stopped falling from the sky .
NIVUK	Genesis	8	3	The water receded steadily from the earth . At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down ,
NIVUK	Genesis	8	4	and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat .
NIVUK	Genesis	8	5	The waters continued to recede until the tenth month , and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible .
NIVUK	Genesis	8	6	After forty days Noah opened a window he had made in the ark
NIVUK	Genesis	8	7	and sent out a raven , and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth .
NIVUK	Genesis	8	9	But the dove could find nowhere to perch because there was water over all the surface of the earth ; so it returned to Noah in the ark . He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark .
NIVUK	Genesis	8	10	He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark .
NIVUK	Genesis	8	11	When the dove returned to him in the evening , there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf ! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth .
NIVUK	Genesis	8	12	He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again , but this time it did not return to him .

NIVUK	Genesis	8	14	By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry .
NIVUK	Genesis	8	15	Then God said to Noah ,
NIVUK	Genesis	8	16	‘ Come out of the ark , you and your wife and your sons and their wives .
NIVUK	Genesis	8	17	Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you – the birds , the animals , and all the creatures that move along the ground – so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number on it. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	8	18	So Noah came out , together with his sons and his wife and his sons ’ wives .
NIVUK	Genesis	8	19	All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds – everything that moves on land – came out of the ark , one kind after another .
NIVUK	Genesis	8	20	Then Noah built an altar to the Lord and , taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds , he sacrificed burnt offerings on it .
NIVUK	Genesis	8	21	The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart : ‘ Never again will I curse the ground because of humans , even though [ a ] every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood . And never again will I destroy all living creatures , as I have done .

NIVUK	Genesis	9	2	The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth , and on all the birds in the sky , on every creature that moves along the ground , and on all the fish in the sea ; they are given into your hands .
NIVUK	Genesis	9	3	Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you . Just as I gave you the green plants , I now give you everything .
NIVUK	Genesis	9	4	‘ But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it .

NIVUK	Genesis	9	7	As for you , be fruitful and increase in number ; multiply on the earth and increase upon it. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	9	8	Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him :
NIVUK	Genesis	9	10	and with every living creature that was with you – the birds , the livestock and all the wild animals , all those that came out of the ark with you – every living creature on earth .
NIVUK	Genesis	9	11	I establish my covenant with you : never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood ; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	9	12	And God said , ‘ This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you , a covenant for all generations to come :
NIVUK	Genesis	9	13	I have set my rainbow in the clouds , and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth .
NIVUK	Genesis	9	14	Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds ,
NIVUK	Genesis	9	15	I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind . Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life .
NIVUK	Genesis	9	16	Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds , I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	9	17	So God said to Noah , ‘ This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth. ’ The sons of Noah
NIVUK	Genesis	9	18	The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem , Ham and Japheth . ( Ham was the father of Canaan . )

NIVUK	Genesis	9	20	Noah , a man of the soil , proceeded [ a ] to plant a vineyard .
NIVUK	Genesis	9	21	When he drank some of its wine , he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent .
NIVUK	Genesis	9	22	Ham , the father of Canaan , saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside .
NIVUK	Genesis	9	23	But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders ; then they walked in backwards and covered their father ’ s naked body . Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father naked .
NIVUK	Genesis	9	24	When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him ,
NIVUK	Genesis	9	25	he said , ‘ Cursed be Canaan ! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	9	26	He also said , ‘ Praise be to the Lord , the God of Shem ! May Canaan be the slave of Shem .
NIVUK	Genesis	9	27	May God extend Japheth ’ s [ b ] territory ; may Japheth live in the tents of Shem , and may Canaan be the slave of Japheth. ’

NIVUK	Genesis	16	3	So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years , Sarai his wife took her Egyptian slave Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife .
NIVUK	Genesis	16	4	He slept with Hagar , and she conceived . When she knew she was pregnant , she began to despise her mistress .
NIVUK	Genesis	16	5	Then Sarai said to Abram , ‘ You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering . I put my slave in your arms , and now that she knows she is pregnant , she despises me . May the Lord judge between you and me. ’

NIVUK	Genesis	17	3	Abram fell face down , and God said to him ,

NIVUK	Genesis	17	14	Any uncircumcised male , who has not been circumcised in the flesh , will be cut off from his people ; he has broken my covenant. ’

NIVUK	Genesis	18	2	Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby . When he saw them , he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground .
NIVUK	Genesis	18	3	He said , ‘ If I have found favour in your eyes , my lord , [ a ] do not pass your servant by .
NIVUK	Genesis	18	4	Let a little water be brought , and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree .
NIVUK	Genesis	18	5	Let me get you something to eat , so you can be refreshed and then go on your way – now that you have come to your servant. ’ ‘ Very well , ’ they answered , ‘ do as you say. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	18	6	So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah . ‘ Quick , ’ he said , ‘ get three seahs [ b ] of the finest flour and knead it and bake some bread. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	18	7	Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice , tender calf and gave it to a servant , who hurried to prepare it .
NIVUK	Genesis	18	8	He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared , and set these before them . While they ate , he stood near them under a tree .
NIVUK	Genesis	18	9	‘ Where is your wife Sarah ? ’ they asked him . ‘ There , in the tent , ’ he said .
NIVUK	Genesis	18	10	Then one of them said , ‘ I will surely return to you about this time next year , and Sarah your wife will have a son. ’ Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent , which was behind him .
NIVUK	Genesis	18	11	Abraham and Sarah were already very old , and Sarah was past the age of childbearing .
NIVUK	Genesis	18	12	So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought , ‘ After I am worn out and my lord is old , will I now have this pleasure ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	18	13	Then the Lord said to Abraham , ‘ Why did Sarah laugh and say , “ Will I really have a child , now that I am old ? ”
NIVUK	Genesis	18	14	Is anything too hard for the Lord ? I will return to you at the appointed time next year , and Sarah will have a son. ’

NIVUK	Genesis	18	19	For I have chosen him , so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and just , so that the Lord will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him. ’

NIVUK	Genesis	18	22	The men turned away and went towards Sodom , but Abraham remained standing before the Lord . [ d ]
NIVUK	Genesis	18	23	Then Abraham approached him and said : ‘ Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked ?

NIVUK	Genesis	18	29	Once again he spoke to him , ‘ What if only forty are found there ? ’ He said , ‘ For the sake of forty , I will not do it. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	18	30	Then he said , ‘ May the Lord not be angry , but let me speak . What if only thirty can be found there ? ’ He answered , ‘ I will not do it if I find thirty there. ’

NIVUK	Genesis	19	19	Your [ c ] servant has found favour in your [ d ] eyes , and you [ e ] have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life . But I can ’ t flee to the mountains ; this disaster will overtake me , and I ’ ll die .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	2	‘ My lords , ’ he said , ‘ please turn aside to your servant ’ s house . You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning. ’ ‘ No , ’ they answered , ‘ we will spend the night in the square. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	19	3	But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house . He prepared a meal for them , baking bread without yeast , and they ate .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	4	Before they had gone to bed , all the men from every part of the city of Sodom – both young and old – surrounded the house .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	5	They called to Lot , ‘ Where are the men who came to you tonight ? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	19	6	Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him
NIVUK	Genesis	19	7	and said , ‘ No , my friends . Don ’ t do this wicked thing .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	8	Look , I have two daughters who have never slept with a man . Let me bring them out to you , and you can do what you like with them . But don ’ t do anything to these men , for they have come under the protection of my roof. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	19	9	‘ Get out of our way , ’ they replied . ‘ This fellow came here as a foreigner , and now he wants to play the judge ! We ’ ll treat you worse than them. ’ They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	10	But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	11	Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house , young and old , with blindness so that they could not find the door .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	12	The two men said to Lot , ‘ Do you have anyone else here – sons-in-law , sons or daughters , or anyone else in the city who belongs to you ? Get them out of here ,
NIVUK	Genesis	19	13	because we are going to destroy this place . The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	19	14	So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law , who were pledged to marry [ a ] his daughters . He said , ‘ Hurry and get out of this place , because the Lord is about to destroy the city ! ’ But his sons-in-law thought he was joking .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	15	With the coming of dawn , the angels urged Lot , saying , ‘ Hurry ! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here , or you will be swept away when the city is punished. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	19	16	When he hesitated , the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city , for the Lord was merciful to them .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	17	As soon as they had brought them out , one of them said , ‘ Flee for your lives ! Don ’ t look back , and don ’ t stop anywhere in the plain ! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away ! ’
NIVUK	Genesis	19	18	But Lot said to them , ‘ No , my lords , [ b ] please !
NIVUK	Genesis	19	20	Look , here is a town near enough to run to , and it is small . Let me flee to it – it is very small , isn ’ t it ? Then my life will be spared. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	19	21	He said to him , ‘ Very well , I will grant this request too ; I will not overthrow the town you speak of .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	22	But flee there quickly , because I can not do anything until you reach it. ’ ( That is why the town was called Zoar . [ f ] )
NIVUK	Genesis	19	23	By the time Lot reached Zoar , the sun had risen over the land .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	24	Then the Lord rained down burning sulphur on Sodom and Gomorrah – from the Lord out of the heavens .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	25	Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain , destroying all those living in the cities – and also the vegetation in the land .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	26	But Lot ’ s wife looked back , and she became a pillar of salt .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	27	Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the Lord .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	28	He looked down towards Sodom and Gomorrah , towards all the land of the plain , and he saw dense smoke rising from the land , like smoke from a furnace .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	29	So when God destroyed the cities of the plain , he remembered Abraham , and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived . Lot and his daughters
NIVUK	Genesis	19	30	Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains , for he was afraid to stay in Zoar . He and his two daughters lived in a cave .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	31	One day the elder daughter said to the younger , ‘ Our father is old , and there is no man round here to give us children – as is the custom all over the earth .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	32	Let ’ s get our father to drink wine and then sleep with him and preserve our family line through our father. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	19	33	That night they got their father to drink wine , and the elder daughter went in and slept with him . He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	34	The next day the elder daughter said to the younger , ‘ Last night I slept with my father . Let ’ s get him to drink wine again tonight , and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	19	35	So they got their father to drink wine that night also , and the younger daughter went in and slept with him . Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	36	So both of Lot ’ s daughters became pregnant by their father .
NIVUK	Genesis	19	37	The elder daughter had a son , and she named him Moab ; [ g ] he is the father of the Moabites of today .

NIVUK	Genesis	21	8	The child grew and was weaned , and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast .
NIVUK	Genesis	21	9	But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking ,
NIVUK	Genesis	21	10	and she said to Abraham , ‘ Get rid of that slave woman and her son , for that woman ’ s son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	21	11	The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son .

NIVUK	Genesis	21	14	Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar . He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy . She went on her way and wandered in the Desert of Beersheba .
NIVUK	Genesis	21	15	When the water in the skin was gone , she put the boy under one of the bushes .

NIVUK	Genesis	22	2	Then God said , ‘ Take your son , your only son , whom you love – Isaac – and go to the region of Moriah . Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain that I will show you. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	22	3	Early the next morning Abraham got up and loaded his donkey . He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac . When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering , he set out for the place God had told him about .
NIVUK	Genesis	22	4	On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance .
NIVUK	Genesis	22	5	He said to his servants , ‘ Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there . We will worship and then we will come back to you. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	22	6	Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac , and he himself carried the fire and the knife . As the two of them went on together ,
NIVUK	Genesis	22	7	Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham , ‘ Father ? ’ ‘ Yes , my son ? ’ Abraham replied . ‘ The fire and wood are here , ’ Isaac said , ‘ but where is the lamb for the burnt offering ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	22	8	Abraham answered , ‘ God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering , my son. ’ And the two of them went on together .
NIVUK	Genesis	22	9	When they reached the place God had told him about , Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it . He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar , on top of the wood .
NIVUK	Genesis	22	10	Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son .
NIVUK	Genesis	22	11	But the angel of the Lord called out to him from heaven , ‘ Abraham ! Abraham ! ’ ‘ Here I am , ’ he replied .
NIVUK	Genesis	22	12	‘ Do not lay a hand on the boy , ’ he said . ‘ Do not do anything to him . Now I know that you fear God , because you have not withheld from me your son , your only son. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	22	13	Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram [ a ] caught by its horns . He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son .
NIVUK	Genesis	22	14	So Abraham called that place The Lord Will Provide . And to this day it is said , ‘ On the mountain of the Lord it will be provided. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	22	15	The angel of the Lord called to Abraham from heaven a second time
NIVUK	Genesis	22	16	and said , ‘ I swear by myself , declares the Lord , that because you have done this and have not withheld your son , your only son ,
NIVUK	Genesis	22	17	I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore . Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies ,
NIVUK	Genesis	22	18	and through your offspring [ b ] all nations on earth will be blessed , [ c ] because you have obeyed me. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	22	19	Then Abraham returned to his servants , and they set off together for Beersheba . And Abraham stayed in Beersheba . Nahor ’ s sons
NIVUK	Genesis	22	20	Some time later Abraham was told , ‘ Milkah is also a mother ; she has borne sons to your brother Nahor :
NIVUK	Genesis	22	21	Uz the firstborn , Buz his brother , Kemuel ( the father of Aram ) ,
NIVUK	Genesis	22	23	Bethuel became the father of Rebekah . Milkah bore these eight sons to Abraham ’ s brother Nahor .
NIVUK	Genesis	22	24	His concubine , whose name was Reumah , also had sons : Tebah , Gaham , Tahash and Maakah .

NIVUK	Genesis	23	23	Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old .
NIVUK	Genesis	23	2	She died at Kiriath Arba ( that is , Hebron ) in the land of Canaan , and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her .
NIVUK	Genesis	23	3	Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites . [ a ] He said ,
NIVUK	Genesis	23	4	‘ I am a foreigner and stranger among you . Sell me some property for a burial site here so that I can bury my dead. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	23	5	,
NIVUK	Genesis	23	6	‘ Sir , listen to us . You are a mighty prince among us . Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs . None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	23	7	,
NIVUK	Genesis	23	8	He said to them , ‘ If you are willing to let me bury my dead , then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf
NIVUK	Genesis	23	9	so that he will sell me the cave of Machpelah , which belongs to him and is at the end of his field . Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	23	10	,
NIVUK	Genesis	23	11	‘ No , my lord , ’ he said . ‘ Listen to me ; I give [ b ] you the field , and I give [ c ] you the cave that is in it . I give [ d ] it to you in the presence of my people . Bury your dead. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	23	12	Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land
NIVUK	Genesis	23	13	and he said to Ephron in their hearing , ‘ Listen to me , if you will . I will pay the price of the field . Accept it from me so that I can bury my dead there. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	23	14	Ephron answered Abraham ,
NIVUK	Genesis	23	15	‘ Listen to me , my lord ; the land is worth four hundred shekels [ e ] of silver , but what is that between you and me ? Bury your dead. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	23	16	,
NIVUK	Genesis	23	17	So Ephron ’ s field in Machpelah near Mamre – both the field and the cave in it , and all the trees within the borders of the field – was legally made over
NIVUK	Genesis	23	18	and
NIVUK	Genesis	23	19	Afterwards Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre ( which is at Hebron ) in the land of Canaan .

NIVUK	Genesis	24	24	She answered him , ‘ I am the daughter of Bethuel , the son that Milkah bore to Nahor. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	2	He said to the senior servant in his household , the one in charge of all that he had , ‘ Put your hand under my thigh .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	3	I want you to swear by the Lord , the God of heaven and the God of earth , that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites , among whom I am living ,
NIVUK	Genesis	24	4	but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	5	The servant asked him , ‘ What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land ? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	6	‘ Make sure that you do not take my son back there , ’ Abraham said .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	7	‘ The Lord , the God of heaven , who brought me out of my father ’ s household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath , saying , “ To your offspring [ a ] I will give this land ” – he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	8	If the woman is unwilling to come back with you , then you will be released from this oath of mine . Only do not take my son back there. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	9	So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	10	Then the servant left , taking with him ten of his master ’ s camels loaded with all kinds of good things from his master . He set out for Aram Naharaim [ b ] and made his way to the town of Nahor .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	11	He made the camels kneel down near the well outside the town ; it was towards evening , the time the women go out to draw water .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	12	Then he prayed , ‘ Lord , God of my master Abraham , make me successful today , and show kindness to my master Abraham .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	13	See , I am standing beside this spring , and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	14	May it be that when I say to a young woman , “ Please let down your jar that I may have a drink , ” and she says , “ Drink , and I ’ ll water your camels too ” – let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac . By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	15	Before he had finished praying , Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder . She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milkah , who was the wife of Abraham ’ s brother Nahor .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	16	The woman was very beautiful , a virgin ; no man had ever slept with her . She went down to the spring , filled her jar and came up again .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	17	The servant hurried to meet her and said , ‘ Please give me a little water from your jar. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	18	‘ Drink , my lord , ’ she said , and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	19	After she had given him a drink , she said , ‘ I ’ ll draw water for your camels too , until they have had enough to drink. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	20	So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough , ran back to the well to draw more water , and drew enough for all his camels .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	21	Without saying a word , the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the Lord had made his journey successful .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	22	When the camels had finished drinking , the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka [ c ] and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels . [ d ]
NIVUK	Genesis	24	23	Then he asked , ‘ Whose daughter are you ? Please tell me , is there room in your father ’ s house for us to spend the night ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	25	And she added , ‘ We have plenty of straw and fodder , as well as room for you to spend the night. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	26	Then the man bowed down and worshipped the Lord ,
NIVUK	Genesis	24	27	saying , ‘ Praise be to the Lord , the God of my master Abraham , who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master . As for me , the Lord has led me on the journey to the house of my master ’ s relatives. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	28	The young woman ran and told her mother ’ s household about these things .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	29	Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban , and he hurried out to the man at the spring .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	30	As soon as he had seen the nose ring , and the bracelets on his sister ’ s arms , and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her , he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	31	‘ Come , you who are blessed by the Lord , ’ he said . ‘ Why are you standing out here ? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	32	So the man went to the house , and the camels were unloaded . Straw and fodder were brought for the camels , and water for him and his men to wash their feet .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	33	Then food was set before him , but he said , ‘ I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say. ’ ‘ Then tell us , ’ Laban said .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	34	So he said , ‘ I am Abraham ’ s servant .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	35	The Lord has blessed my master abundantly , and he has become wealthy . He has given him sheep and cattle , silver and gold , male and female servants , and camels and donkeys .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	36	My master ’ s wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age , and he has given him everything he owns .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	37	And my master made me swear an oath , and said , “ You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites , in whose land I live ,
NIVUK	Genesis	24	38	but go to my father ’ s family and to my own clan , and get a wife for my son. ”
NIVUK	Genesis	24	39	‘ Then I asked my master , “ What if the woman will not come back with me ? ”
NIVUK	Genesis	24	40	‘ He replied , “ The Lord , before whom I have walked faithfully , will send his angel with you and make your journey a success , so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father ’ s family .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	41	You will be released from my oath if , when you go to my clan , they refuse to give her to you – then you will be released from my oath. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	42	‘ When I came to the spring today , I said , “ Lord , God of my master Abraham , if you will , please grant success to the journey on which I have come .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	43	See , I am standing beside this spring . If a young woman comes out to draw water and I say to her , ‘ Please let me drink a little water from your jar , ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	44	and if she says to me , ‘ Drink , and I ’ ll draw water for your camels too , ’ let her be the one the Lord has chosen for my master ’ s son. ”
NIVUK	Genesis	24	45	‘ Before I finished praying in my heart , Rebekah came out , with her jar on her shoulder . She went down to the spring and drew water , and I said to her , “ Please give me a drink. ”
NIVUK	Genesis	24	46	‘ She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said , “ Drink , and I ’ ll water your camels too. ” So I drank , and she watered the camels also .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	47	‘ I asked her , “ Whose daughter are you ? ” ‘ She said , “ The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor , whom Milkah bore to him. ” ‘ Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms ,
NIVUK	Genesis	24	48	and I bowed down and worshipped the Lord . I praised the Lord , the God of my master Abraham , who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master ’ s brother for his son .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	49	Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master , tell me ; and if not , tell me , so I may know which way to turn. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	50	Laban and Bethuel answered , ‘ This is from the Lord ; we can say nothing to you one way or the other .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	51	Here is Rebekah ; take her and go , and let her become the wife of your master ’ s son , as the Lord has directed. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	52	When Abraham ’ s servant heard what they said , he bowed down to the ground before the Lord .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	53	Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewellery and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah ; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	54	Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there . When they got up the next morning , he said , ‘ Send me on my way to my master. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	55	But her brother and her mother replied , ‘ Let the young woman remain with us ten days or so ; then you [ e ] may go. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	56	But he said to them , ‘ Do not detain me , now that the Lord has granted success to my journey . Send me on my way so I may go to my master. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	57	Then they said , ‘ Let ’ s call the young woman and ask her about it. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	58	So they called Rebekah and asked her , ‘ Will you go with this man ? ’ ‘ I will go , ’ she said .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	59	So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way , along with her nurse and Abraham ’ s servant and his men .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	60	And they blessed Rebekah and said to her , ‘ Our sister , may you increase to thousands upon thousands ; may your offspring possess the cities of their enemies. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	24	61	Then Rebekah and her attendants got ready and mounted the camels and went back with the man . So the servant took Rebekah and left .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	62	Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi , for he was living in the Negev .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	63	He went out to the field one evening to meditate , [ f ] and as he looked up , he saw camels approaching .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	64	Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac . She got down from her camel
NIVUK	Genesis	24	65	and asked the servant , ‘ Who is that man in the field coming to meet us ? ’ ‘ He is my master , ’ the servant answered . So she took her veil and covered herself .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	66	Then the servant told Isaac all he had done .
NIVUK	Genesis	24	67	Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah , and he married Rebekah . So she became his wife , and he loved her ; and Isaac was comforted after his mother ’ s death .

NIVUK	Genesis	25	25	The first to come out was red , and his whole body was like a hairy garment ; so they named him Esau . [ d ]
NIVUK	Genesis	25	2	She bore him Zimran , Jokshan , Medan , Midian , Ishbak and Shuah .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	3	Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan ; the descendants of Dedan were the Ashurites , the Letushites and the Leummites .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	4	The sons of Midian were Ephah , Epher , Hanok , Abida and Eldaah . All these were descendants of Keturah .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	5	Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	6	But while he was still living , he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	7	Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	8	Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age , an old man and full of years ; and he was gathered to his people .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	9	His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre , in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite ,
NIVUK	Genesis	25	10	the field Abraham had bought from the Hittites . [ a ] There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	11	After Abraham ’ s death , God blessed his son Isaac , who then lived near Beer Lahai Roi . Ishmael ’ s sons
NIVUK	Genesis	25	12	This is the account of the family line of Abraham ’ s son Ishmael , whom Sarah ’ s slave , Hagar the Egyptian , bore to Abraham .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	13	These are the names of the sons of Ishmael , listed in the order of their birth : Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael , Kedar , Adbeel , Mibsam ,
NIVUK	Genesis	25	14	Mishma , Dumah , Massa ,
NIVUK	Genesis	25	15	Hadad , Tema , Jetur , Naphish and Kedemah .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	16	These were the sons of Ishmael , and these are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	17	Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years . He breathed his last and died , and he was gathered to his people .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	18	His descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur , near the eastern border of Egypt , as you go towards Ashur . And they lived in hostility towards [ b ] all the tribes related to them . Jacob and Esau
NIVUK	Genesis	25	19	This is the account of the family line of Abraham ’ s son Isaac . Abraham became the father of Isaac ,
NIVUK	Genesis	25	20	and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram [ c ] and sister of Laban the Aramean .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	21	Isaac prayed to the Lord on behalf of his wife , because she was childless . The Lord answered his prayer , and his wife Rebekah became pregnant .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	22	The babies jostled each other within her , and she said , ‘ Why is this happening to me ? ’ So she went to enquire of the Lord .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	23	The Lord said to her , ‘ Two nations are in your womb , and two peoples from within you will be separated ; one people will be stronger than the other , and the elder will serve the younger. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	25	24	When the time came for her to give birth , there were twin boys in her womb .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	26	After this , his brother came out , with his hand grasping Esau ’ s heel ; so he was named Jacob . [ e ] Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	27	The boys grew up , and Esau became a skilful hunter , a man of the open country , while Jacob was content to stay at home among the tents .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	28	Isaac , who had a taste for wild game , loved Esau , but Rebekah loved Jacob .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	29	Once when Jacob was cooking some stew , Esau came in from the open country , famished .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	30	He said to Jacob , ‘ Quick , let me have some of that red stew ! I ’ m famished ! ’ ( That is why he was also called Edom . [ f ] )
NIVUK	Genesis	25	31	Jacob replied , ‘ First sell me your birthright. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	25	32	‘ Look , I am about to die , ’ Esau said . ‘ What good is the birthright to me ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	25	33	But Jacob said , ‘ Swear to me first. ’ So he swore an oath to him , selling his birthright to Jacob .
NIVUK	Genesis	25	34	Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew . He ate and drank , and then got up and left . So Esau despised his birthright .

NIVUK	Genesis	26	26	Meanwhile , Abimelek had come to him from Gerar , with Ahuzzath his personal advisor and Phicol the commander of his forces .
NIVUK	Genesis	26	2	The Lord appeared to Isaac and said , ‘ Do not go down to Egypt ; live in the land where I tell you to live .
NIVUK	Genesis	26	3	Stay in this land for a while , and I will be with you and will bless you . For to you and your descendants I will give all these lands and will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham .
NIVUK	Genesis	26	4	I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give them all these lands , and through your offspring [ a ] all nations on earth will be blessed , [ b ]
NIVUK	Genesis	26	5	because Abraham obeyed me and did everything I required of him , keeping my commands , my decrees and my instructions. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	26	6	So Isaac stayed in Gerar .
NIVUK	Genesis	26	7	When the men of that place asked him about his wife , he said , ‘ She is my sister , ’ because he was afraid to say , ‘ She is my wife. ’ He thought , ‘ The men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah , because she is beautiful. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	26	8	When Isaac had been there a long time , Abimelek king of the Philistines looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah .
NIVUK	Genesis	26	9	So Abimelek summoned Isaac and said , ‘ She is really your wife ! Why did you say , “ She is my sister ” ? ’ Isaac answered him , ‘ Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	26	10	Then Abimelek said , ‘ What is this you have done to us ? One of the men might well have slept with your wife , and you would have brought guilt upon us. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	26	11	So Abimelek gave orders to all the people : ‘ Anyone who harms this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	26	12	Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold , because the Lord blessed him .
NIVUK	Genesis	26	13	The man became rich , and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy .
NIVUK	Genesis	26	14	He had so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him .
NIVUK	Genesis	26	15	So all the wells that his father ’ s servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham , the Philistines stopped up , filling them with earth .
NIVUK	Genesis	26	16	Then Abimelek said to Isaac , ‘ Move away from us ; you have become too powerful for us. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	26	17	So Isaac moved away from there and camped in the Valley of Gerar , where he settled .
NIVUK	Genesis	26	18	Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham , which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died , and he gave them the same names his father had given them .
NIVUK	Genesis	26	19	Isaac ’ s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there .
NIVUK	Genesis	26	20	But the herdsmen of Gerar quarrelled with those of Isaac and said , ‘ The water is ours ! ’ So he named the well Esek , [ c ] because they disputed with him .
NIVUK	Genesis	26	21	Then they dug another well , but they quarrelled over that one also ; so he named it Sitnah . [ d ]
NIVUK	Genesis	26	22	He moved on from there and dug another well , and no one quarrelled over it . He named it Rehoboth , [ e ] saying , ‘ Now the Lord has given us room and we will flourish in the land. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	26	23	From there he went up to Beersheba .
NIVUK	Genesis	26	24	That night the Lord appeared to him and said , ‘ I am the God of your father Abraham . Do not be afraid , for I am with you ; I will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	26	25	Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the Lord . There he pitched his tent , and there his servants dug a well .
NIVUK	Genesis	26	27	Isaac asked them , ‘ Why have you come to me , since you were hostile to me and sent me away ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	26	28	They answered , ‘ We saw clearly that the Lord was with you ; so we said , “ There ought to be a sworn agreement between us ” – between us and you . Let us make a treaty with you
NIVUK	Genesis	26	29	that you will do us no harm , just as we did not harm you but always treated you well and sent you away peacefully . And now you are blessed by the Lord. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	26	30	Isaac then made a feast for them , and they ate and drank .
NIVUK	Genesis	26	31	Early the next morning the men swore an oath to each other . Then Isaac sent them on their way , and they went away peacefully .
NIVUK	Genesis	26	32	That day Isaac ’ s servants came and told him about the well they had dug . They said , ‘ We ’ ve found water ! ’
NIVUK	Genesis	26	33	He called it Shibah , [ f ] and to this day the name of the town has been Beersheba . [ g ] Jacob takes Esau ’ s blessing
NIVUK	Genesis	26	34	When Esau was forty years old , he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite , and also Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite .
NIVUK	Genesis	26	35	They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah .

NIVUK	Genesis	27	27	So he went to him and kissed him . When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes , he blessed him and said , ‘ Ah , the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the Lord has blessed .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	2	Isaac said , ‘ I am now an old man and don ’ t know the day of my death .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	3	Now then , get your equipment – your quiver and bow – and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	4	Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat , so that I may give you my blessing before I die. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	5	Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau . When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back ,
NIVUK	Genesis	27	6	Rebekah said to her son Jacob , ‘ Look , I overheard your father say to your brother Esau ,
NIVUK	Genesis	27	7	“ Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat , so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the Lord before I die. ”
NIVUK	Genesis	27	8	Now , my son , listen carefully and do what I tell you :
NIVUK	Genesis	27	9	go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats , so that I can prepare some tasty food for your father , just the way he likes it .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	10	Then take it to your father to eat , so that he may give you his blessing before he dies. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	11	Jacob said to Rebekah his mother , ‘ But my brother Esau is a hairy man while I have smooth skin .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	12	What if my father touches me ? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	13	His mother said to him , ‘ My son , let the curse fall on me . Just do what I say ; go and get them for me. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	14	So he went and got them and brought them to his mother , and she prepared some tasty food , just the way his father liked it .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	15	Then Rebekah took the best clothes of her elder son Esau , which she had in the house , and put them on her younger son Jacob .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	16	She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	17	Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	18	He went to his father and said , ‘ My father. ’ ‘ Yes , my son , ’ he answered . ‘ Who is it ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	19	Jacob said to his father , ‘ I am Esau your firstborn . I have done as you told me . Please sit up and eat some of my game , so that you may give me your blessing. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	20	Isaac asked his son , ‘ How did you find it so quickly , my son ? ’ ‘ The Lord your God gave me success , ’ he replied .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	21	Then Isaac said to Jacob , ‘ Come near so I can touch you , my son , to know whether you really are my son Esau or not. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	22	Jacob went close to his father Isaac , who touched him and said , ‘ The voice is the voice of Jacob , but the hands are the hands of Esau. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	23	He did not recognise him , for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau ; so he proceeded to bless him .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	24	‘ Are you really my son Esau ? ’ he asked . ‘ I am , ’ he replied .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	25	Then he said , ‘ My son , bring me some of your game to eat , so that I may give you my blessing. ’ Jacob brought it to him and he ate ; and he brought some wine and he drank .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	26	Then his father Isaac said to him , ‘ Come here , my son , and kiss me. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	28	May God give you heaven ’ s dew and earth ’ s richness – an abundance of grain and new wine .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	29	May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you . Be lord over your brothers , and may the sons of your mother bow down to you . May those who curse you be cursed and those who bless you be blessed. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	30	After Isaac finished blessing him , and Jacob had scarcely left his father ’ s presence , his brother Esau came in from hunting .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	31	He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father . Then he said to him , ‘ My father , please sit up and eat some of my game , so that you may give me your blessing. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	32	His father Isaac asked him , ‘ Who are you ? ’ ‘ I am your son , ’ he answered , ‘ your firstborn , Esau. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	33	Isaac trembled violently and said , ‘ Who was it , then , that hunted game and brought it to me ? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him – and indeed he will be blessed ! ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	34	When Esau heard his father ’ s words , he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father , ‘ Bless me – me too , my father ! ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	35	But he said , ‘ Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	36	Esau said , ‘ Isn ’ t he rightly named Jacob ? [ a ] This is the second time he has taken advantage of me : he took my birthright , and now he ’ s taken my blessing ! ’ Then he asked , ‘ Haven ’ t you reserved any blessing for me ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	37	Isaac answered Esau , ‘ I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants , and I have sustained him with grain and new wine . So what can I possibly do for you , my son ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	38	Esau said to his father , ‘ Do you have only one blessing , my father ? Bless me too , my father ! ’ Then Esau wept aloud .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	39	His father Isaac answered him , ‘ Your dwelling will be away from the earth ’ s richness , away from the dew of heaven above .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	40	You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother . But when you grow restless , you will throw his yoke from off your neck. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	41	Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him . He said to himself , ‘ The days of mourning for my father are near ; then I will kill my brother Jacob. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	42	When Rebekah was told what her elder son Esau had said , she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him , ‘ Your brother Esau is planning to avenge himself by killing you .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	43	Now then , my son , do what I say : flee at once to my brother Laban in Harran .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	44	Stay with him for a while until your brother ’ s fury subsides .
NIVUK	Genesis	27	45	When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him , I ’ ll send word for you to come back from there . Why should I lose both of you in one day ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	27	46	Then Rebekah said to Isaac , ‘ I ’ m disgusted with living because of these Hittite women . If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land , from Hittite women like these , my life will not be worth living. ’ Footnotes - Genesis 27:36 Jacob means he grasps the heel , a Hebrew idiom for he takes advantage of or he deceives .

NIVUK	Genesis	28	28	So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him . Then he commanded him : ‘ Do not marry a Canaanite woman .
NIVUK	Genesis	28	2	Go at once to Paddan Aram , [ a ] to the house of your mother ’ s father Bethuel . Take a wife for yourself there , from among the daughters of Laban , your mother ’ s brother .
NIVUK	Genesis	28	3	May God Almighty [ b ] bless you and make you fruitful and increase your numbers until you become a community of peoples .
NIVUK	Genesis	28	4	May he give you and your descendants the blessing given to Abraham , so that you may take possession of the land where you now reside as a foreigner , the land God gave to Abraham. ’

NIVUK	Genesis	28	8	Esau then realised how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac ;
NIVUK	Genesis	28	9	so he went to Ishmael and married Mahalath , the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham , in addition to the wives he already had . Jacob ’ s dream at Bethel
NIVUK	Genesis	28	10	Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Harran .
NIVUK	Genesis	28	11	When he reached a certain place , he stopped for the night because the sun had set . Taking one of the stones there , he put it under his head and lay down to sleep .
NIVUK	Genesis	28	12	He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth , with its top reaching to heaven , and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it .
NIVUK	Genesis	28	13	There above it [ c ] stood the Lord , and he said : ‘ I am the Lord , the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac . I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying .
NIVUK	Genesis	28	14	Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth , and you will spread out to the west and to the east , to the north and to the south . All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring . [ d ]
NIVUK	Genesis	28	15	I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go , and I will bring you back to this land . I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	28	16	When Jacob awoke from his sleep , he thought , ‘ Surely the Lord is in this place , and I was not aware of it. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	28	17	He was afraid and said , ‘ How awesome is this place ! This is none other than the house of God ; this is the gate of heaven. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	28	18	Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it .
NIVUK	Genesis	28	19	He called that place Bethel , [ e ] though the city used to be called Luz .
NIVUK	Genesis	28	20	Then Jacob made a vow , saying , ‘ If God will be with me and will watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear
NIVUK	Genesis	28	21	so that I return safely to my father ’ s household , then the Lord [ f ] will be my God

NIVUK	Genesis	29	29	Laban gave his servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her attendant .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	2	There he saw a well in the open country , with three flocks of sheep lying near it because the flocks were watered from that well . The stone over the mouth of the well was large .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	3	When all the flocks were gathered there , the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well ’ s mouth and water the sheep . Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	4	Jacob asked the shepherds , ‘ My brothers , where are you from ? ’ ‘ We ’ re from Harran , ’ they replied .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	5	He said to them , ‘ Do you know Laban , Nahor ’ s grandson ? ’ ‘ Yes , we know him , ’ they answered .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	6	Then Jacob asked them , ‘ Is he well ? ’ ‘ Yes , he is , ’ they said , ‘ and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	29	7	‘ Look , ’ he said , ‘ the sun is still high ; it is not time for the flocks to be gathered . Water the sheep and take them back to pasture. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	29	8	‘ We can ’ t , ’ they replied , ‘ until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well . Then we will water the sheep. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	29	9	While he was still talking with them , Rachel came with her father ’ s sheep , for she was a shepherd .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	10	When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of his uncle Laban , and Laban ’ s sheep , he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle ’ s sheep .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	11	Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	12	He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah . So she ran and told her father .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	13	As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob , his sister ’ s son , he hurried to meet him . He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home , and there Jacob told him all these things .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	14	Then Laban said to him , ‘ You are my own flesh and blood. ’ Jacob marries Leah and Rachel After Jacob had stayed with him for a whole month ,
NIVUK	Genesis	29	15	Laban said to him , ‘ Just because you are a relative of mine , should you work for me for nothing ? Tell me what your wages should be. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	29	16	Now Laban had two daughters ; the name of the elder one was Leah , and the name of the younger was Rachel .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	17	Leah had weak [ a ] eyes , but Rachel had a lovely figure and was beautiful .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	18	Jacob was in love with Rachel and said , ‘ I ’ ll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	29	19	Laban said , ‘ It ’ s better that I give her to you than to some other man . Stay here with me. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	29	20	So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel , but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	21	Then Jacob said to Laban , ‘ Give me my wife . My time is completed , and I want to make love to her. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	29	22	So Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	23	But when evening came , he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob , and Jacob made love to her .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	24	And Laban gave his servant Zilpah to his daughter as her attendant .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	25	When morning came , there was Leah ! So Jacob said to Laban , ‘ What is this you have done to me ? I served you for Rachel , didn ’ t I ? Why have you deceived me ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	29	26	Laban replied , ‘ It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the elder one .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	27	Finish this daughter ’ s bridal week ; then we will give you the younger one also , in return for another seven years of work. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	29	28	And Jacob did so . He finished the week with Leah , and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	30	Jacob made love to Rachel also , and his love for Rachel was greater than his love for Leah . And he worked for Laban another seven years . Jacob ’ s children
NIVUK	Genesis	29	31	When the Lord saw that Leah was not loved , he enabled her to conceive , but Rachel remained childless .
NIVUK	Genesis	29	32	Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son . She named him Reuben , [ b ] for she said , ‘ It is because the Lord has seen my misery . Surely my husband will love me now. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	29	33	She conceived again , and when she gave birth to a son she said , ‘ Because the Lord heard that I am not loved , he gave me this one too. ’ So she named him Simeon . [ c ]
NIVUK	Genesis	29	34	Again she conceived , and when she gave birth to a son she said , ‘ Now at last my husband will become attached to me , because I have borne him three sons. ’ So he was named Levi . [ d ]
NIVUK	Genesis	29	35	She conceived again , and when she gave birth to a son she said , ‘ This time I will praise the Lord. ’ So she named him Judah . [ e ] Then she stopped having children .

NIVUK	Genesis	30	30	The little you had before I came has increased greatly , and the Lord has blessed you wherever I have been . But now , when may I do something for my own household ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	30	2	Jacob became angry with her and said , ‘ Am I in the place of God , who has kept you from having children ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	30	3	Then she said , ‘ Here is Bilhah , my servant . Sleep with her so that she can bear children for me and I too can build a family through her. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	30	4	So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife . Jacob slept with her ,
NIVUK	Genesis	30	5	and she became pregnant and bore him a son .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	6	Then Rachel said , ‘ God has vindicated me ; he has listened to my plea and given me a son. ’ Because of this she named him Dan . [ a ]
NIVUK	Genesis	30	7	Rachel ’ s servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	8	Then Rachel said , ‘ I have had a great struggle with my sister , and I have won. ’ So she named him Naphtali . [ b ]
NIVUK	Genesis	30	9	When Leah saw that she had stopped having children , she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	10	Leah ’ s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	11	Then Leah said , ‘ What good fortune ! ’ [ c ] So she named him Gad . [ d ]
NIVUK	Genesis	30	12	Leah ’ s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	13	Then Leah said , ‘ How happy I am ! The women will call me happy. ’ So she named him Asher . [ e ]
NIVUK	Genesis	30	14	During wheat harvest , Reuben went out into the fields and found some mandrake plants , which he brought to his mother Leah . Rachel said to Leah , ‘ Please give me some of your son ’ s mandrakes. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	30	15	But she said to her , ‘ Wasn ’ t it enough that you took away my husband ? Will you take my son ’ s mandrakes too ? ’ ‘ Very well , ’ Rachel said , ‘ he can sleep with you tonight in return for your son ’ s mandrakes. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	30	16	So when Jacob came in from the fields that evening , Leah went out to meet him . ‘ You must sleep with me , ’ she said . ‘ I have hired you with my son ’ s mandrakes. ’ So he slept with her that night .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	17	God listened to Leah , and she became pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth son .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	18	Then Leah said , ‘ God has rewarded me for giving my servant to my husband. ’ So she named him Issachar . [ f ]
NIVUK	Genesis	30	19	Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	20	Then Leah said , ‘ God has presented me with a precious gift . This time my husband will treat me with honour , because I have borne him six sons. ’ So she named him Zebulun . [ g ]
NIVUK	Genesis	30	21	Some time later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	22	Then God remembered Rachel ; he listened to her and enabled her to conceive .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	23	She became pregnant and gave birth to a son and said , ‘ God has taken away my disgrace. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	30	24	She named him Joseph , [ h ] and said , ‘ May the Lord add to me another son. ’ Jacob ’ s flocks increase
NIVUK	Genesis	30	25	After Rachel gave birth to Joseph , Jacob said to Laban , ‘ Send me on my way so that I can go back to my own homeland .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	26	Give me my wives and children , for whom I have served you , and I will be on my way . You know how much work I ’ ve done for you. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	30	27	But Laban said to him , ‘ If I have found favour in your eyes , please stay . I have learned by divination that the Lord has blessed me because of you. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	30	28	He added , ‘ Name your wages , and I will pay them. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	30	29	Jacob said to him , ‘ You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	31	‘ What shall I give you ? ’ he asked . ‘ Don ’ t give me anything , ’ Jacob replied . ‘ But if you will do this one thing for me , I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them :
NIVUK	Genesis	30	32	let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep , every dark-coloured lamb and every spotted or speckled goat . They will be my wages .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	33	And my honesty will testify for me in the future , whenever you check on the wages you have paid me . Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted , or any lamb that is not dark-coloured , will be considered stolen. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	30	34	‘ Agreed , ’ said Laban . ‘ Let it be as you have said. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	30	35	That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted , and all the speckled or spotted female goats ( all that had white on them ) and all the dark-coloured lambs , and he placed them in the care of his sons .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	36	Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob , while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban ’ s flocks .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	37	Jacob , however , took fresh-cut branches from poplar , almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	38	Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs , so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink . When the flocks were in heat and came to drink ,
NIVUK	Genesis	30	39	they mated in front of the branches . And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	40	Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves , but made the rest face the streaked and dark-coloured animals that belonged to Laban . Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban ’ s animals .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	41	Whenever the stronger females were in heat , Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so that they would mate near the branches ,
NIVUK	Genesis	30	42	but if the animals were weak , he would not place them there . So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob .
NIVUK	Genesis	30	43	In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks , and female and male servants , and camels and donkeys .

NIVUK	Genesis	31	31	Jacob answered Laban , ‘ I was afraid , because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	2	And Jacob noticed that Laban ’ s attitude towards him was not what it had been .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	3	Then the Lord said to Jacob , ‘ Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives , and I will be with you. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	31	4	So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	5	He said to them , ‘ I see that your father ’ s attitude towards me is not what it was before , but the God of my father has been with me .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	6	You know that I ’ ve worked for your father with all my strength ,
NIVUK	Genesis	31	7	yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages ten times . However , God has not allowed him to harm me .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	8	If he said , “ The speckled ones will be your wages , ” then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young ; and if he said , “ The streaked ones will be your wages , ” then all the flocks bore streaked young .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	9	So God has taken away your father ’ s livestock and has given them to me .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	10	‘ In the breeding season I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked , speckled or spotted .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	11	The angel of God said to me in the dream , “ Jacob. ” I answered , “ Here I am. ”
NIVUK	Genesis	31	12	And he said , “ Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked , speckled or spotted , for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	13	I am the God of Bethel , where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me . Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land. ” ’
NIVUK	Genesis	31	14	Then Rachel and Leah replied , ‘ Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father ’ s estate ?
NIVUK	Genesis	31	15	Does he not regard us as foreigners ? Not only has he sold us , but he has used up what was paid for us .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	16	Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children . So do whatever God has told you. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	31	17	Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels ,
NIVUK	Genesis	31	18	and he drove all his livestock ahead of him , along with all the goods he had accumulated in Paddan Aram , [ a ] to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	19	When Laban had gone to shear his sheep , Rachel stole her father ’ s household gods .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	20	Moreover , Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was running away .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	21	So he fled with all he had , crossed the River Euphrates , and headed for the hill country of Gilead . Laban pursues Jacob
NIVUK	Genesis	31	22	On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	23	Taking his relatives with him , he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	24	Then God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him , ‘ Be careful not to say anything to Jacob , either good or bad. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	31	25	Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him , and Laban and his relatives camped there too .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	26	Then Laban said to Jacob , ‘ What have you done ? You ’ ve deceived me , and you ’ ve carried off my daughters like captives in war .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	27	Why did you run off secretly and deceive me ? Why didn ’ t you tell me , so that I could send you away with joy and singing to the music of tambourines and harps ?
NIVUK	Genesis	31	28	You didn ’ t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye . You have done a foolish thing .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	29	I have the power to harm you ; but last night the God of your father said to me , “ Be careful not to say anything to Jacob , either good or bad. ”
NIVUK	Genesis	31	30	Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your father ’ s household . But why did you steal my gods ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	31	32	But if you find anyone who has your gods , that person shall not live . In the presence of our relatives , see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me ; and if so , take it. ’ Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	33	So Laban went into Jacob ’ s tent and into Leah ’ s tent and into the tent of the two female servants , but he found nothing . After he came out of Leah ’ s tent , he entered Rachel ’ s tent .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	34	Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel ’ s saddle and was sitting on them . Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	35	Rachel said to her father , ‘ Don ’ t be angry , my lord , that I can not stand up in your presence ; I ’ m having my period. ’ So he searched but could not find the household gods .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	36	Jacob was angry and took Laban to task . ‘ What is my crime ? ’ he asked Laban . ‘ How have I wronged you that you hunt me down ?
NIVUK	Genesis	31	37	Now that you have searched through all my goods , what have you found that belongs to your household ? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine , and let them judge between the two of us .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	38	‘ I have been with you for twenty years now . Your sheep and goats have not miscarried , nor have I eaten rams from your flocks .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	39	I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts ; I bore the loss myself . And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	40	This was my situation : the heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night , and sleep fled from my eyes .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	41	It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household . I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks , and you changed my wages ten times .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	42	If the God of my father , the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac , had not been with me , you would surely have sent me away empty-handed . But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands , and last night he rebuked you. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	31	43	Laban answered Jacob , ‘ The women are my daughters , the children are my children , and the flocks are my flocks . All you see is mine . Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine , or about the children they have borne ?
NIVUK	Genesis	31	44	Come now , let ’ s make a covenant , you and I , and let it serve as a witness between us. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	31	45	So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	46	He said to his relatives , ‘ Gather some stones. ’ So they took stones and piled them in a heap , and they ate there by the heap .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	47	Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha , and Jacob called it Galeed . [ b ]
NIVUK	Genesis	31	48	Laban said , ‘ This heap is a witness between you and me today. ’ That is why it was called Galeed .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	49	It was also called Mizpah , [ c ] because he said , ‘ May the Lord keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	50	If you ill-treat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters , even though no one is with us , remember that God is a witness between you and me. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	31	51	Laban also said to Jacob , ‘ Here is this heap , and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	52	This heap is a witness , and this pillar is a witness , that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	53	May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor , the God of their father , judge between us. ’ So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	54	He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal . After they had eaten , they spent the night there .
NIVUK	Genesis	31	55	Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them . Then he left and returned home .

NIVUK	Genesis	32	2	When Jacob saw them , he said , ‘ This is the camp of God ! ’ So he named that place Mahanaim . [ b ]
NIVUK	Genesis	32	3	Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir , the country of Edom .
NIVUK	Genesis	32	4	He instructed them : ‘ This is what you are to say to my lord Esau : “ Your servant Jacob says , I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now .
NIVUK	Genesis	32	5	I have cattle and donkeys , sheep and goats , male and female servants . Now I am sending this message to my lord , that I may find favour in your eyes. ” ’
NIVUK	Genesis	32	6	When the messengers returned to Jacob , they said , ‘ We went to your brother Esau , and now he is coming to meet you , and four hundred men are with him. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	32	7	In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups , [ c ] and the flocks and herds and camels as well .
NIVUK	Genesis	32	8	He thought , ‘ If Esau comes and attacks one group , [ d ] the group [ e ] that is left may escape. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	32	9	Then Jacob prayed , ‘ O God of my father Abraham , God of my father Isaac , Lord , you who said to me , “ Go back to your country and your relatives , and I will make you prosper , ”
NIVUK	Genesis	32	10	I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant . I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan , but now I have become two camps .
NIVUK	Genesis	32	11	Save me , I pray , from the hand of my brother Esau , for I am afraid he will come and attack me , and also the mothers with their children .
NIVUK	Genesis	32	12	But you have said , “ I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea , which can not be counted. ” ’
NIVUK	Genesis	32	13	He spent the night there , and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau :
NIVUK	Genesis	32	14	two hundred female goats and twenty male goats , two hundred ewes and twenty rams ,
NIVUK	Genesis	32	15	thirty female camels with their young , forty cows and ten bulls , and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys .
NIVUK	Genesis	32	16	He put them in the care of his servants , each herd by itself , and said to his servants , ‘ Go ahead of me , and keep some space between the herds. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	32	17	He instructed the one in the lead : ‘ When my brother Esau meets you and asks , “ Who do you belong to , and where are you going , and who owns all these animals in front of you ? ”
NIVUK	Genesis	32	18	then you are to say , “ They belong to your servant Jacob . They are a gift sent to my lord Esau , and he is coming behind us. ” ’
NIVUK	Genesis	32	19	He also instructed the second , the third and all the others who followed the herds : ‘ You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him .
NIVUK	Genesis	32	20	And be sure to say , “ Your servant Jacob is coming behind us. ” ’ For he thought , ‘ I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead ; later , when I see him , perhaps he will receive me. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	32	21	So Jacob ’ s gifts went on ahead of him , but he himself spent the night in the camp . Jacob wrestles with God
NIVUK	Genesis	32	22	That night Jacob got up and took his two wives , his two female servants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok .
NIVUK	Genesis	32	23	After he had sent them across the stream , he sent over all his possessions .
NIVUK	Genesis	32	24	So Jacob was left alone , and a man wrestled with him till daybreak .
NIVUK	Genesis	32	25	When the man saw that he could not overpower him , he touched the socket of Jacob ’ s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man .
NIVUK	Genesis	32	26	Then the man said , ‘ Let me go , for it is daybreak. ’ But Jacob replied , ‘ I will not let you go unless you bless me. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	32	27	The man asked him , ‘ What is your name ? ’ ‘ Jacob , ’ he answered .
NIVUK	Genesis	32	28	Then the man said , ‘ Your name will no longer be Jacob , but Israel , [ f ] because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	32	29	Jacob said , ‘ Please tell me your name. ’ But he replied , ‘ Why do you ask my name ? ’ Then he blessed him there .
NIVUK	Genesis	32	30	So Jacob called the place Peniel , [ g ] saying , ‘ It is because I saw God face to face , and yet my life was spared. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	32	31	The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel , [ h ] and he was limping because of his hip .

NIVUK	Genesis	33	33	Jacob looked up and there was Esau , coming with his four hundred men ; so he divided the children among Leah , Rachel and the two female servants .
NIVUK	Genesis	33	2	He put the female servants and their children in front , Leah and her children next , and Rachel and Joseph in the rear .
NIVUK	Genesis	33	3	He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother .
NIVUK	Genesis	33	4	But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him ; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him . And they wept .
NIVUK	Genesis	33	5	Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children . ‘ Who are these with you ? ’ he asked . Jacob answered , ‘ They are the children God has graciously given your servant. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	33	6	Then the female servants and their children approached and bowed down .
NIVUK	Genesis	33	7	Next , Leah and her children came and bowed down . Last of all came Joseph and Rachel , and they too bowed down .
NIVUK	Genesis	33	8	Esau asked , ‘ What ’ s the meaning of all these flocks and herds I met ? ’ ‘ To find favour in your eyes , my lord , ’ he said .
NIVUK	Genesis	33	9	But Esau said , ‘ I already have plenty , my brother . Keep what you have for yourself. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	33	10	‘ No , please ! ’ said Jacob . ‘ If I have found favour in your eyes , accept this gift from me . For to see your face is like seeing the face of God , now that you have received me favourably .
NIVUK	Genesis	33	11	Please accept the present that was brought to you , for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need. ’ And because Jacob insisted , Esau accepted it .
NIVUK	Genesis	33	12	Then Esau said , ‘ Let us be on our way ; I ’ ll accompany you. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	33	13	But Jacob said to him , ‘ My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young . If they are driven hard just one day , all the animals will die .
NIVUK	Genesis	33	14	So let my lord go on ahead of his servant , while I move along slowly at the pace of the flocks and herds before me and the pace of the children , until I come to my lord in Seir. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	33	15	Esau said , ‘ Then let me leave some of my men with you. ’ ‘ But why do that ? ’ Jacob asked . ‘ Just let me find favour in the eyes of my lord. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	33	16	So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir .
NIVUK	Genesis	33	17	Jacob , however , went to Sukkoth , where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock . That is why the place is called Sukkoth . [ a ]
NIVUK	Genesis	33	18	After Jacob came from Paddan Aram , [ b ] he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city .
NIVUK	Genesis	33	19	For a hundred pieces of silver , [ c ] he bought from the sons of Hamor , the father of Shechem , the plot of ground where he pitched his tent .
NIVUK	Genesis	33	20	There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel .

NIVUK	Genesis	34	34	Now Dinah , the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob , went out to visit the women of the land .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	2	When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite , the ruler of that area , saw her , he took her and raped her .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	3	His heart was drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob ; he loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	4	And Shechem said to his father Hamor , ‘ Get me this girl as my wife. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	34	5	When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled , his sons were in the fields with his livestock ; so he did nothing about it until they came home .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	6	Then Shechem ’ s father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	7	Meanwhile , Jacob ’ s sons had come in from the fields as soon as they heard what had happened . They were shocked and furious , because Shechem had done an outrageous thing in [ a ] Israel by sleeping with Jacob ’ s daughter – a thing that should not be done .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	8	But Hamor said to them , ‘ My son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter . Please give her to him as his wife .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	9	Intermarry with us ; give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	10	You can settle among us ; the land is open to you . Live in it , trade [ b ] in it , and acquire property in it. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	34	11	Then Shechem said to Dinah ’ s father and brothers , ‘ Let me find favour in your eyes , and I will give you whatever you ask .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	12	Make the price for the bride and the gift I am to bring as great as you like , and I ’ ll pay whatever you ask me . Only give me the young woman as my wife. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	34	13	Because their sister Dinah had been defiled , Jacob ’ s sons replied deceitfully as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	14	They said to them , ‘ We can ’ t do such a thing ; we can ’ t give our sister to a man who is not circumcised . That would be a disgrace to us .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	15	We will enter into an agreement with you on one condition only : that you become like us by circumcising all your males .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	16	Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves . We ’ ll settle among you and become one people with you .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	17	But if you will not agree to be circumcised , we ’ ll take our sister and go. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	34	18	Their proposal seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	19	The young man , who was the most honoured of all his father ’ s family , lost no time in doing what they said , because he was delighted with Jacob ’ s daughter .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	20	So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city to speak to the men of their city .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	21	- Genesis 34:27 Or because Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	Genesis	34	22	But the men will agree to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised , as they themselves are .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	23	Won ’ t their livestock , their property and all their other animals become ours ? So let us agree to their terms , and they will settle among us. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	34	24	All the men who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem , and every male in the city was circumcised .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	25	Three days later , while all of them were still in pain , two of Jacob ’ s sons , Simeon and Levi , Dinah ’ s brothers , took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city , killing every male .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	26	They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechem ’ s house and left .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	27	The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where [ c ] their sister had been defiled .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	28	They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	29	They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children , taking as plunder everything in the houses .
NIVUK	Genesis	34	30	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi , ‘ You have brought trouble on me by making me obnoxious to the Canaanites and Perizzites , the people living in this land . We are few in number , and if they join forces against me and attack me , I and my household will be destroyed. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	34	31	But they replied , ‘ Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute ? ’ Footnotes - Genesis 34:7 Or against - Genesis 34:10 Or move about freely ; also in verse

NIVUK	Genesis	35	35	Then God said to Jacob , ‘ Go up to Bethel and settle there , and build an altar there to God , who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	35	2	So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him , ‘ Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you , and purify yourselves and change your clothes .
NIVUK	Genesis	35	3	Then come , let us go up to Bethel , where I will build an altar to God , who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	35	4	So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears , and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem .
NIVUK	Genesis	35	5	Then they set out , and the terror of God fell on the towns all around them so that no one pursued them .
NIVUK	Genesis	35	6	Jacob and all the people with him came to Luz ( that is , Bethel ) in the land of Canaan .
NIVUK	Genesis	35	7	There he built an altar , and he called the place El Bethel , [ a ] because it was there that God revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother .
NIVUK	Genesis	35	8	Now Deborah , Rebekah ’ s nurse , died and was buried under the oak outside Bethel . So it was named Allon Bakuth . [ b ]
NIVUK	Genesis	35	9	After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram , [ c ] God appeared to him again and blessed him .
NIVUK	Genesis	35	10	God said to him , ‘ Your name is Jacob , [ d ] but you will no longer be called Jacob ; your name will be Israel . [ e ] ’ So he named him Israel .
NIVUK	Genesis	35	11	And God said to him , ‘ I am God Almighty ; [ f ] be fruitful and increase in number . A nation and a community of nations will come from you , and kings will be among your descendants .
NIVUK	Genesis	35	12	The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I also give to you , and I will give this land to your descendants after you. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	35	13	Then God went up from him at the place where he had talked with him .
NIVUK	Genesis	35	14	Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him , and he poured out a drink offering on it ; he also poured oil on it .
NIVUK	Genesis	35	15	Jacob called the place where God had talked with him Bethel . [ g ] The deaths of Rachel and Isaac
NIVUK	Genesis	35	16	Then they moved on from Bethel . While they were still some distance from Ephrath , Rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty .
NIVUK	Genesis	35	17	And as she was having great difficulty in childbirth , the midwife said to her , ‘ Don ’ t despair , for you have another son. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	35	18	As she breathed her last – for she was dying – she named her son Ben-Oni . [ h ] But his father named him Benjamin . [ i ]
NIVUK	Genesis	35	19	So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath ( that is , Bethlehem ) .
NIVUK	Genesis	35	20	Over her tomb Jacob set up a pillar , and to this day that pillar marks Rachel ’ s tomb .
NIVUK	Genesis	35	21	Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder .
NIVUK	Genesis	35	22	While Israel was living in that region , Reuben went in and slept with his father ’ s concubine Bilhah , and Israel heard of it . Jacob had twelve sons :

NIVUK	Genesis	37	37	Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed , the land of Canaan .
NIVUK	Genesis	37	2	This is the account of Jacob ’ s family line . Joseph , a young man of seventeen , was tending the flocks with his brothers , the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah , his father ’ s wives , and he brought their father a bad report about them .
NIVUK	Genesis	37	3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons , because he had been born to him in his old age ; and he made an ornate [ a ] robe for him .
NIVUK	Genesis	37	4	When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them , they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him .
NIVUK	Genesis	37	5	Joseph had a dream , and when he told it to his brothers , they hated him all the more .
NIVUK	Genesis	37	6	He said to them , ‘ Listen to this dream I had :
NIVUK	Genesis	37	7	we were binding sheaves of corn out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright , while your sheaves gathered round mine and bowed down to it. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	37	8	His brothers said to him , ‘ Do you intend to reign over us ? Will you actually rule us ? ’ And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said .
NIVUK	Genesis	37	9	Then he had another dream , and he told it to his brothers . ‘ Listen , ’ he said , ‘ I had another dream , and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	37	10	When he told his father as well as his brothers , his father rebuked him and said , ‘ What is this dream you had ? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	37	11	His brothers were jealous of him , but his father kept the matter in mind . Joseph sold by his brothers
NIVUK	Genesis	37	12	Now his brothers had gone to graze their father ’ s flocks near Shechem ,
NIVUK	Genesis	37	13	and Israel said to Joseph , ‘ As you know , your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem . Come , I am going to send you to them. ’ ‘ Very well , ’ he replied .
NIVUK	Genesis	37	14	So he said to him , ‘ Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks , and bring word back to me. ’ Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron . When Joseph arrived at Shechem ,
NIVUK	Genesis	37	15	a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him , ‘ What are you looking for ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	37	16	He replied , ‘ I ’ m looking for my brothers . Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	37	17	‘ They have moved on from here , ’ the man answered . ‘ I heard them say , “ Let ’ s go to Dothan. ” ’ So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan .
NIVUK	Genesis	37	18	But they saw him in the distance , and before he reached them , they plotted to kill him .
NIVUK	Genesis	37	19	‘ Here comes that dreamer ! ’ they said to each other .
NIVUK	Genesis	37	20	‘ Come now , let ’ s kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him . Then we ’ ll see what comes of his dreams. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	37	21	When Reuben heard this , he tried to rescue him from their hands . ‘ Let ’ s not take his life , ’ he said .
NIVUK	Genesis	37	22	‘ Don ’ t shed any blood . Throw him into this cistern here in the wilderness , but don ’ t lay a hand on him. ’ Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father .
NIVUK	Genesis	37	23	and
NIVUK	Genesis	37	24	and they took him and threw him into the cistern . The cistern was empty ; there was no water in it .
NIVUK	Genesis	37	25	As they sat down to eat their meal , they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead . Their camels were loaded with spices , balm and myrrh , and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt .
NIVUK	Genesis	37	26	Judah said to his brothers , ‘ What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood ?
NIVUK	Genesis	37	27	Come , let ’ s sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him ; after all , he is our brother , our own flesh and blood. ’ His brothers agreed .

NIVUK	Genesis	37	29	When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there , he tore his clothes .
NIVUK	Genesis	37	30	He went back to his brothers and said , ‘ The boy isn ’ t there ! Where can I turn now ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	37	31	Then they got Joseph ’ s robe , slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood .
NIVUK	Genesis	37	32	. - Genesis 37:28 That is , about
NIVUK	Genesis	37	33	He recognised it and said , ‘ It is my son ’ s robe ! Some ferocious animal has devoured him . Joseph has surely been torn to pieces. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	37	34	Then Jacob tore his clothes , put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days .
NIVUK	Genesis	37	35	All his sons and daughters came to comfort him , but he refused to be comforted . ‘ No , ’ he said , ‘ I will continue to mourn until I join my son in the grave. ’ So his father wept for him .
NIVUK	Genesis	37	36	Meanwhile , the Midianites [ c ] sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar , one of Pharaoh ’ s officials , the captain of the guard . Footnotes - Genesis 37:3 The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain ; also in verses

NIVUK	Genesis	38	38	At that time , Judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullam named Hirah .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	2	There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua . He married her and made love to her ;
NIVUK	Genesis	38	3	she became pregnant and gave birth to a son , who was named Er .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	4	She conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	5	She gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah . It was at Kezib that she gave birth to him .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	6	Judah got a wife for Er , his firstborn , and her name was Tamar .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	7	But Er , Judah ’ s firstborn , was wicked in the Lord ’ s sight ; so the Lord put him to death .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	8	Then Judah said to Onan , ‘ Sleep with your brother ’ s wife and fulfil your duty to her as a brother-in-law to raise up offspring for your brother. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	38	9	But Onan knew that the child would not be his ; so whenever he slept with his brother ’ s wife , he spilled his semen on the ground to avoid providing offspring for his brother .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	10	What he did was wicked in the Lord ’ s sight ; so the Lord put him to death also .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	11	Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar , ‘ Live as a widow in your father ’ s household until my son Shelah grows up. ’ For he thought , ‘ He may die too , just like his brothers. ’ So Tamar went to live in her father ’ s household .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	12	After a long time Judah ’ s wife , the daughter of Shua , died . When Judah had recovered from his grief , he went up to Timnah , to the men who were shearing his sheep , and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went with him .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	13	When Tamar was told , ‘ Your father-in-law is on his way to Timnah to shear his sheep , ’
NIVUK	Genesis	38	14	she took off her widow ’ s clothes , covered herself with a veil to disguise herself , and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim , which is on the road to Timnah . For she saw that , though Shelah had now grown up , she had not been given to him as his wife .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	15	When Judah saw her , he thought she was a prostitute , for she had covered her face .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	16	Not realising that she was his daughter-in-law , he went over to her by the roadside and said , ‘ Come now , let me sleep with you. ’ ‘ And what will you give me to sleep with you ? ’ she asked .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	17	‘ I ’ ll send you a young goat from my flock , ’ he said . ‘ Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it ? ’ she asked .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	18	He said , ‘ What pledge should I give you ? ’ ‘ Your seal and its cord , and the staff in your hand , ’ she answered . So he gave them to her and slept with her , and she became pregnant by him .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	19	After she left , she took off her veil and put on her widow ’ s clothes again .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	20	Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order to get his pledge back from the woman , but he did not find her .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	21	He asked the men who lived there , ‘ Where is the shrine-prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim ? ’ ‘ There hasn ’ t been any shrine-prostitute here , ’ they said .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	22	So he went back to Judah and said , ‘ I didn ’ t find her . Besides , the men who lived there said , “ There hasn ’ t been any shrine-prostitute here. ” ’
NIVUK	Genesis	38	23	Then Judah said , ‘ Let her keep what she has , or we will become a laughing-stock . After all , I did send her this young goat , but you didn ’ t find her. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	38	24	About three months later Judah was told , ‘ Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution , and as a result she is now pregnant. ’ Judah said , ‘ Bring her out and let her be burned to death ! ’
NIVUK	Genesis	38	25	As she was being brought out , she sent a message to her father-in-law . ‘ I am pregnant by the man who owns these , ’ she said . And she added , ‘ See if you recognise whose seal and cord and staff these are. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	38	26	Judah recognised them and said , ‘ She is more righteous than I , since I wouldn ’ t give her to my son Shelah. ’ And he did not sleep with her again .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	27	When the time came for her to give birth , there were twin boys in her womb .
NIVUK	Genesis	38	28	As she was giving birth , one of them put out his hand ; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said , ‘ This one came out first. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	38	29	But when he drew back his hand , his brother came out , and she said , ‘ So this is how you have broken out ! ’ And he was named Perez . [ a ]
NIVUK	Genesis	38	30	Then his brother , who had the scarlet thread on his wrist , came out . And he was named Zerah .

NIVUK	Genesis	39	39	Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt . Potiphar , an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh ’ s officials , the captain of the guard , bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there .
NIVUK	Genesis	39	2	The Lord was with Joseph so that he prospered , and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master .
NIVUK	Genesis	39	3	When his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord gave him success in everything he did ,
NIVUK	Genesis	39	4	Joseph found favour in his eyes and became his attendant . Potiphar put him in charge of his household , and he entrusted to his care everything he owned .
NIVUK	Genesis	39	5	From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned , the Lord blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph . The blessing of the Lord was on everything Potiphar had , both in the house and in the field .
NIVUK	Genesis	39	6	So Potiphar left everything he had in Joseph ’ s care ; with Joseph in charge , he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate . Now Joseph was well-built and handsome ,
NIVUK	Genesis	39	7	and after a while his master ’ s wife took notice of Joseph and said , ‘ Come to bed with me ! ’
NIVUK	Genesis	39	8	But he refused . ‘ With me in charge , ’ he told her , ‘ my master does not concern himself with anything in the house ; everything he owns he has entrusted to my care .
NIVUK	Genesis	39	9	No one is greater in this house than I am . My master has withheld nothing from me except you , because you are his wife . How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	39	10	And though she spoke to Joseph day after day , he refused to go to bed with her or even to be with her .
NIVUK	Genesis	39	11	One day he went into the house to attend to his duties , and none of the household servants was inside .
NIVUK	Genesis	39	12	She caught him by his cloak and said , ‘ Come to bed with me ! ’ But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house .
NIVUK	Genesis	39	13	When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house ,
NIVUK	Genesis	39	14	she called her household servants . ‘ Look , ’ she said to them , ‘ this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us ! He came in here to sleep with me , but I screamed .
NIVUK	Genesis	39	15	When he heard me scream for help , he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	39	16	She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home .
NIVUK	Genesis	39	17	Then she told him this story : ‘ That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me .
NIVUK	Genesis	39	18	But as soon as I screamed for help , he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	39	19	When his master heard the story his wife told him , saying , ‘ This is how your slave treated me , ’ he burned with anger .
NIVUK	Genesis	39	20	Joseph ’ s master took him and put him in prison , the place where the king ’ s prisoners were confined . But while Joseph was there in the prison ,
NIVUK	Genesis	39	21	the Lord was with him ; he showed him kindness and granted him favour in the eyes of the prison warder .
NIVUK	Genesis	39	22	So the warder put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison , and he was made responsible for all that was done there .
NIVUK	Genesis	39	23	The warder paid no attention to anything under Joseph ’ s care , because the Lord was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Genesis	40	40	Some time later , the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master , the king of Egypt .
NIVUK	Genesis	40	2	Pharaoh was angry with his two officials , the chief cupbearer and the chief baker ,
NIVUK	Genesis	40	3	and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard , in the same prison where Joseph was confined .
NIVUK	Genesis	40	4	The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph , and he attended them . After they had been in custody for some time ,
NIVUK	Genesis	40	5	each of the two men – the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt , who were being held in prison – had a dream the same night , and each dream had a meaning of its own .
NIVUK	Genesis	40	6	When Joseph came to them the next morning , he saw that they were dejected .
NIVUK	Genesis	40	7	So he asked Pharaoh ’ s officials who were in custody with him in his master ’ s house , ‘ Why do you look so sad today ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	40	8	‘ We both had dreams , ’ they answered , ‘ but there is no one to interpret them. ’ Then Joseph said to them , ‘ Do not interpretations belong to God ? Tell me your dreams. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	40	9	So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream . He said to him , ‘ In my dream I saw a vine in front of me ,
NIVUK	Genesis	40	10	and on the vine were three branches . As soon as it budded , it blossomed , and its clusters ripened into grapes .
NIVUK	Genesis	40	11	Pharaoh ’ s cup was in my hand , and I took the grapes , squeezed them into Pharaoh ’ s cup and put the cup in his hand. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	40	12	‘ This is what it means , ’ Joseph said to him . ‘ The three branches are three days .
NIVUK	Genesis	40	13	Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position , and you will put Pharaoh ’ s cup in his hand , just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer .
NIVUK	Genesis	40	14	But when all goes well with you , remember me and show me kindness ; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison .
NIVUK	Genesis	40	15	I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews , and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	40	16	When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favourable interpretation , he said to Joseph , ‘ I too had a dream : on my head were three baskets of bread . [ a ]
NIVUK	Genesis	40	17	In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh , but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	40	18	‘ This is what it means , ’ Joseph said . ‘ The three baskets are three days .
NIVUK	Genesis	40	19	Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and impale your body on a pole . And the birds will eat away your flesh. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	40	20	Now the third day was Pharaoh ’ s birthday , and he gave a feast for all his officials . He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his officials :
NIVUK	Genesis	40	21	he restored the chief cupbearer to his position , so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh ’ s hand –
NIVUK	Genesis	40	22	but he impaled the chief baker , just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation .
NIVUK	Genesis	40	23	The chief cupbearer , however , did not remember Joseph ; he forgot him . Footnotes - Genesis 40:16 Or three wicker baskets Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Genesis	41	41	So Pharaoh said to Joseph , ‘ I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	41	2	when out of the river there came up seven cows , sleek and fat , and they grazed among the reeds .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	3	After them , seven other cows , ugly and gaunt , came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the river-bank .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	4	And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek , fat cows . Then Pharaoh woke up .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	5	He fell asleep again and had a second dream : seven ears of corn , healthy and good , were growing on a single stalk .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	6	After them , seven other ears of corn sprouted – thin and scorched by the east wind .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	7	The thin ears of corn swallowed up the seven healthy , full ears . Then Pharaoh woke up ; it had been a dream .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	8	In the morning his mind was troubled , so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt . Pharaoh told them his dreams , but no one could interpret them for him .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	9	Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh , ‘ Today I am reminded of my shortcomings .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	10	Pharaoh was once angry with his servants , and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	11	Each of us had a dream the same night , and each dream had a meaning of its own .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	12	Now a young Hebrew was there with us , a servant of the captain of the guard . We told him our dreams , and he interpreted them for us , giving each man the interpretation of his dream .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	13	And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us : I was restored to my position , and the other man was impaled. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	41	14	So Pharaoh sent for Joseph , and he was quickly brought from the dungeon . When he had shaved and changed his clothes , he came before Pharaoh .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	15	Pharaoh said to Joseph , ‘ I had a dream , and no one can interpret it . But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	41	16	‘ I can not do it , ’ Joseph replied to Pharaoh , ‘ but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	41	17	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph , ‘ In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile ,
NIVUK	Genesis	41	18	when out of the river there came up seven cows , fat and sleek , and they grazed among the reeds .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	19	After them , seven other cows came up – scrawny and very ugly and lean . I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	20	The lean , ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	21	But even after they ate them , no one could tell that they had done so ; they looked just as ugly as before . Then I woke up .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	22	‘ In my dream I saw seven ears of corn , full and good , growing on a single stalk .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	23	After them , seven other ears sprouted – withered and thin and scorched by the east wind .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	24	The thin ears of corn swallowed up the seven good ears . I told this to the magicians , but none of them could explain it to me. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	41	25	Then Joseph said to Pharaoh , ‘ The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same . God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	26	The seven good cows are seven years , and the seven good ears of corn are seven years ; it is one and the same dream .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	27	The seven lean , ugly cows that came up afterwards are seven years , and so are the seven worthless ears of corn scorched by the east wind : they are seven years of famine .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	28	‘ It is just as I said to Pharaoh : God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	29	Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt ,
NIVUK	Genesis	41	30	but seven years of famine will follow them . Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten , and the famine will ravage the land .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	31	The abundance in the land will not be remembered , because the famine that follows it will be so severe .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	32	The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God , and God will do it soon .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	33	‘ And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	34	Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	35	They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh , to be kept in the cities for food .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	36	This food should be held in reserve for the country , to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt , so that the country may not be ruined by the famine. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	41	37	The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	38	So Pharaoh asked them , ‘ Can we find anyone like this man , one in whom is the spirit of God ? ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	Genesis	41	39	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph , ‘ Since God has made all this known to you , there is no one so discerning and wise as you .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	40	You shall be in charge of my palace , and all my people are to submit to your orders . Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you. ’ Joseph in charge of Egypt
NIVUK	Genesis	41	42	Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph ’ s finger . He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain round his neck .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	43	He made him ride in a chariot as his second-in-command , [ b ] and people shouted before him , ‘ Make way [ c ] ! ’ Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	44	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph , ‘ I am Pharaoh , but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	41	45	Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera , priest of On , [ d ] to be his wife . And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	46	Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt . And Joseph went out from Pharaoh ’ s presence and travelled throughout Egypt .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	47	During the seven years of abundance the land produced plentifully .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	48	Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities . In each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	49	Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain , like the sand of the sea ; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure .

NIVUK	Genesis	41	53	The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end ,
NIVUK	Genesis	41	54	and the seven years of famine began , just as Joseph had said . There was famine in all the other lands , but in the whole land of Egypt there was food .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	55	When all Egypt began to feel the famine , the people cried to Pharaoh for food . Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians , ‘ Go to Joseph and do what he tells you. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	41	56	When the famine had spread over the whole country , Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians , for the famine was severe throughout Egypt .
NIVUK	Genesis	41	57	And all the world came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph , because the famine was severe everywhere .

NIVUK	Genesis	42	42	When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt , he said to his sons , ‘ Why do you just keep looking at each other ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	42	2	He continued , ‘ I have heard that there is grain in Egypt . Go down there and buy some for us , so that we may live and not die. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	42	3	Then ten of Joseph ’ s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt .
NIVUK	Genesis	42	4	But Jacob did not send Benjamin , Joseph ’ s brother , with the others , because he was afraid that harm might come to him .
NIVUK	Genesis	42	5	So Israel ’ s sons were among those who went to buy grain , for there was famine in the land of Canaan also .
NIVUK	Genesis	42	6	Now Joseph was the governor of the land , the person who sold grain to all its people . So when Joseph ’ s brothers arrived , they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground .
NIVUK	Genesis	42	7	As soon as Joseph saw his brothers , he recognised them , but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them . ‘ Where do you come from ? ’ he asked . ‘ From the land of Canaan , ’ they replied , ‘ to buy food. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	42	8	Although Joseph recognised his brothers , they did not recognise him .
NIVUK	Genesis	42	9	Then he remembered his dreams about them and said to them , ‘ You are spies ! You have come to see where our land is unprotected. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	42	10	‘ No , my lord , ’ they answered . ‘ Your servants have come to buy food .
NIVUK	Genesis	42	11	We are all the sons of one man . Your servants are honest men , not spies. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	42	12	‘ No ! ’ he said to them . ‘ You have come to see where our land is unprotected. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	42	13	But they replied , ‘ Your servants were twelve brothers , the sons of one man , who lives in the land of Canaan . The youngest is now with our father , and one is no more. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	42	14	Joseph said to them , ‘ It is just as I told you : you are spies !
NIVUK	Genesis	42	15	And this is how you will be tested : as surely as Pharaoh lives , you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here .
NIVUK	Genesis	42	16	Send one of your number to get your brother ; the rest of you will be kept in prison , so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth . If you are not , then as surely as Pharaoh lives , you are spies ! ’
NIVUK	Genesis	42	17	And he put them all in custody for three days .
NIVUK	Genesis	42	18	On the third day , Joseph said to them , ‘ Do this and you will live , for I fear God :
NIVUK	Genesis	42	19	if you are honest men , let one of your brothers stay here in prison , while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving households .
NIVUK	Genesis	42	20	But you must bring your youngest brother to me , so that your words may be verified and that you may not die. ’ This they proceeded to do .
NIVUK	Genesis	42	21	They said to one another , ‘ Surely we are being punished because of our brother . We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life , but we would not listen ; that ’ s why this distress has come on us. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	42	22	Reuben replied , ‘ Didn ’ t I tell you not to sin against the boy ? But you wouldn ’ t listen ! Now we must give an accounting for his blood. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	42	23	They did not realise that Joseph could understand them , since he was using an interpreter .
NIVUK	Genesis	42	24	He turned away from them and began to weep , but then came back and spoke to them again . He had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes .
NIVUK	Genesis	42	25	Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain , to put each man ’ s silver back in his sack , and to give them provisions for their journey . After this was done for them ,
NIVUK	Genesis	42	26	they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left .
NIVUK	Genesis	42	27	At the place where they stopped for the night one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey , and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack .
NIVUK	Genesis	42	28	‘ My silver has been returned , ’ he said to his brothers . ‘ Here it is in my sack. ’ Their hearts sank and they turned to each other trembling and said , ‘ What is this that God has done to us ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	42	29	When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan , they told him all that had happened to them . They said ,
NIVUK	Genesis	42	30	‘ The man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the land .
NIVUK	Genesis	42	31	But we said to him , “ We are honest men ; we are not spies .
NIVUK	Genesis	42	32	We were twelve brothers , sons of one father . One is no more , and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan. ”
NIVUK	Genesis	42	33	‘ Then the man who is lord over the land said to us , “ This is how I will know whether you are honest men : leave one of your brothers here with me , and take food for your starving households and go .
NIVUK	Genesis	42	34	But bring your youngest brother to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men . Then I will give your brother back to you , and you can trade [ a ] in the land. ” ’
NIVUK	Genesis	42	35	As they were emptying their sacks , there in each man ’ s sack was his pouch of silver ! When they and their father saw the money pouches , they were frightened .
NIVUK	Genesis	42	36	Their father Jacob said to them , ‘ You have deprived me of my children . Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more , and now you want to take Benjamin . Everything is against me ! ’
NIVUK	Genesis	42	37	Then Reuben said to his father , ‘ You may put both of my sons to death if I do not bring him back to you . Entrust him to my care , and I will bring him back. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	42	38	But Jacob said , ‘ My son will not go down there with you ; his brother is dead and he is the only one left . If harm comes to him on the journey you are taking , you will bring my grey head down to the grave in sorrow. ’ Footnotes - Genesis 42:34 Or move about freely Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Genesis	43	43	Now the famine was still severe in the land .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	2	So when they had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt , their father said to them , ‘ Go back and buy us a little more food. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	43	3	But Judah said to him , ‘ The man warned us solemnly , “ You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you. ”
NIVUK	Genesis	43	4	If you will send our brother along with us , we will go down and buy food for you .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	5	But if you will not send him , we will not go down , because the man said to us , “ You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you. ” ’
NIVUK	Genesis	43	6	Israel asked , ‘ Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had another brother ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	43	7	They replied , ‘ The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family . “ Is your father still living ? ” he asked us . “ Do you have another brother ? ” We simply answered his questions . How were we to know he would say , “ Bring your brother down here ” ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	43	8	Then Judah said to Israel his father , ‘ Send the boy along with me and we will go at once , so that we and you and our children may live and not die .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	9	I myself will guarantee his safety ; you can hold me personally responsible for him . If I do not bring him back to you and set him here before you , I will bear the blame before you all my life .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	10	As it is , if we had not delayed , we could have gone and returned twice. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	43	11	Then their father Israel said to them , ‘ If it must be , then do this : put some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift – a little balm and a little honey , some spices and myrrh , some pistachio nuts and almonds .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	12	Take double the amount of silver with you , for you must return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks . Perhaps it was a mistake .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	13	Take your brother also and go back to the man at once .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	14	And may God Almighty [ a ] grant you mercy before the man so that he will let your other brother and Benjamin come back with you . As for me , if I am bereaved , I am bereaved. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	43	15	So the men took the gifts and double the amount of silver , and Benjamin also . They hurried down to Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them , he said to the steward of his house , ‘ Take these men to my house , slaughter an animal and prepare a meal ; they are to eat with me at noon. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	43	17	The man did as Joseph told him and took the men to Joseph ’ s house .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	18	Now the men were frightened when they were taken to his house . They thought , ‘ We were brought here because of the silver that was put back into our sacks the first time . He wants to attack us and overpower us and seize us as slaves and take our donkeys. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	43	19	So they went up to Joseph ’ s steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	20	‘ We beg your pardon , our lord , ’ they said , ‘ we came down here the first time to buy food .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	21	But at the place where we stopped for the night we opened our sacks and each of us found his silver – the exact weight – in the mouth of his sack . So we have brought it back with us .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	22	We have also brought additional silver with us to buy food . We don ’ t know who put our silver in our sacks. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	43	23	‘ It ’ s all right , ’ he said . ‘ Don ’ t be afraid . Your God , the God of your father , has given you treasure in your sacks ; I received your silver. ’ Then he brought Simeon out to them .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	24	The steward took the men into Joseph ’ s house , gave them water to wash their feet and provided fodder for their donkeys .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	25	They prepared their gifts for Joseph ’ s arrival at noon , because they had heard that they were to eat there .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	26	When Joseph came home , they presented to him the gifts they had brought into the house , and they bowed down before him to the ground .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	27	He asked them how they were , and then he said , ‘ How is your aged father you told me about ? Is he still living ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	43	28	They replied , ‘ Your servant our father is still alive and well. ’ And they bowed down , prostrating themselves before him .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	29	As he looked about and saw his brother Benjamin , his own mother ’ s son , he asked , ‘ Is this your youngest brother , the one you told me about ? ’ And he said , ‘ God be gracious to you , my son. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	43	30	Deeply moved at the sight of his brother , Joseph hurried out and looked for a place to weep . He went into his private room and wept there .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	31	After he had washed his face , he came out and , controlling himself , said , ‘ Serve the food. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	43	32	They served him by himself , the brothers by themselves , and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves , because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews , for that is detestable to Egyptians .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	33	The men had been seated before him in the order of their ages , from the firstborn to the youngest ; and they looked at each other in astonishment .
NIVUK	Genesis	43	34	When portions were served to them from Joseph ’ s table , Benjamin ’ s portion was five times as much as anyone else ’ s . So they feasted and drank freely with him .

NIVUK	Genesis	44	44	Now Joseph gave these instructions to the steward of his house : ‘ Fill the men ’ s sacks with as much food as they can carry , and put each man ’ s silver in the mouth of his sack .
NIVUK	Genesis	44	2	Then put my cup , the silver one , in the mouth of the youngest one ’ s sack , along with the silver for his grain. ’ And he did as Joseph said .
NIVUK	Genesis	44	3	As morning dawned , the men were sent on their way with their donkeys .
NIVUK	Genesis	44	4	They had not gone far from the city when Joseph said to his steward , ‘ Go after those men at once , and when you catch up with them , say to them , “ Why have you repaid good with evil ?
NIVUK	Genesis	44	5	Isn ’ t this the cup my master drinks from and also uses for divination ? This is a wicked thing you have done. ” ’
NIVUK	Genesis	44	6	When he caught up with them , he repeated these words to them .
NIVUK	Genesis	44	7	But they said to him , ‘ Why does my lord say such things ? Far be it from your servants to do anything like that !
NIVUK	Genesis	44	8	We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found inside the mouths of our sacks . So why would we steal silver or gold from your master ’ s house ?
NIVUK	Genesis	44	9	If any of your servants is found to have it , he will die ; and the rest of us will become my lord ’ s slaves. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	44	10	‘ Very well , then , ’ he said , ‘ let it be as you say . Whoever is found to have it will become my slave ; the rest of you will be free from blame. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	44	11	Each of them quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it .
NIVUK	Genesis	44	12	Then the steward proceeded to search , beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest . And the cup was found in Benjamin ’ s sack .
NIVUK	Genesis	44	13	At this , they tore their clothes . Then they all loaded their donkeys and returned to the city .
NIVUK	Genesis	44	14	Joseph was still in the house when Judah and his brothers came in , and they threw themselves to the ground before him .
NIVUK	Genesis	44	15	Joseph said to them , ‘ What is this you have done ? Don ’ t you know that a man like me can find things out by divination ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	44	16	‘ What can we say to my lord ? ’ Judah replied . ‘ What can we say ? How can we prove our innocence ? God has uncovered your servants ’ guilt . We are now my lord ’ s slaves – we ourselves and the one who was found to have the cup. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	44	17	But Joseph said , ‘ Far be it from me to do such a thing ! Only the man who was found to have the cup will become my slave . The rest of you , go back to your father in peace. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	44	18	Then Judah went up to him and said : ‘ Pardon your servant , my lord , let me speak a word to my lord . Do not be angry with your servant , though you are equal to Pharaoh himself .
NIVUK	Genesis	44	19	My lord asked his servants , “ Do you have a father or a brother ? ”
NIVUK	Genesis	44	20	And we answered , “ We have an aged father , and there is a young son born to him in his old age . His brother is dead , and he is the only one of his mother ’ s sons left , and his father loves him. ”
NIVUK	Genesis	44	21	‘ Then you said to your servants , “ Bring him down to me so I can see him for myself. ”
NIVUK	Genesis	44	22	And we said to my lord , “ The boy can not leave his father ; if he leaves him , his father will die. ”
NIVUK	Genesis	44	23	But you told your servants , “ Unless your youngest brother comes down with you , you will not see my face again. ”
NIVUK	Genesis	44	24	When we went back to your servant my father , we told him what my lord had said .
NIVUK	Genesis	44	25	‘ Then our father said , “ Go back and buy a little more food. ”
NIVUK	Genesis	44	26	But we said , “ We can not go down . Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go . We can not see the man ’ s face unless our youngest brother is with us. ”
NIVUK	Genesis	44	27	‘ Your servant my father said to us , “ You know that my wife bore me two sons .
NIVUK	Genesis	44	28	One of them went away from me , and I said , ‘ He has surely been torn to pieces. ’ And I have not seen him since .
NIVUK	Genesis	44	29	If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him , you will bring my grey head down to the grave in misery. ”
NIVUK	Genesis	44	30	‘ So now , if the boy is not with us when I go back to your servant my father , and if my father , whose life is closely bound up with the boy ’ s life ,
NIVUK	Genesis	44	31	sees that the boy isn ’ t there , he will die . Your servants will bring the grey head of our father down to the grave in sorrow .

NIVUK	Genesis	44	33	‘ Now then , please let your servant remain here as my lord ’ s slave in place of the boy , and let the boy return with his brothers .
NIVUK	Genesis	44	34	How can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me ? No ! Do not let me see the misery that would come on my father. ’ Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Genesis	45	45	Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants , and he cried out , ‘ Make everyone leave my presence ! ’ So there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	2	And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him , and Pharaoh ’ s household heard about it .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	3	Joseph said to his brothers , ‘ I am Joseph ! Is my father still living ? ’ But his brothers were not able to answer him , because they were terrified at his presence .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	4	Then Joseph said to his brothers , ‘ Come close to me. ’ When they had done so , he said , ‘ I am your brother Joseph , the one you sold into Egypt !
NIVUK	Genesis	45	5	And now , do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here , because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	6	For two years now there has been famine in the land , and for the next five years there will be no ploughing and reaping .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	7	But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance . [ a ]
NIVUK	Genesis	45	8	‘ So then , it was not you who sent me here , but God . He made me father to Pharaoh , lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	9	Now hurry back to my father and say to him , “ This is what your son Joseph says : God has made me lord of all Egypt . Come down to me ; don ’ t delay .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	10	You shall live in the region of Goshen and be near me – you , your children and grandchildren , your flocks and herds , and all you have .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	11	I will provide for you there , because five years of famine are still to come . Otherwise you and your household and all who belong to you will become destitute. ”
NIVUK	Genesis	45	12	‘ You can see for yourselves , and so can my brother Benjamin , that it is really I who am speaking to you .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	13	Tell my father about all the honour accorded me in Egypt and about everything you have seen . And bring my father down here quickly. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	45	14	Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept , and Benjamin embraced him , weeping .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	15	And he kissed all his brothers and wept over them . Afterwards his brothers talked with him .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	16	When the news reached Pharaoh ’ s palace that Joseph ’ s brothers had come , Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	17	Pharaoh said to Joseph , ‘ Tell your brothers , “ Do this : load your animals and return to the land of Canaan ,
NIVUK	Genesis	45	18	and bring your father and your families back to me . I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you can enjoy the fat of the land. ”
NIVUK	Genesis	45	19	‘ You are also instructed to tell them , “ Do this : take some carts from Egypt for your children and your wives , and get your father and come .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	20	Never mind about your belongings , because the best of all Egypt will be yours. ” ’
NIVUK	Genesis	45	21	So the sons of Israel did this . Joseph gave them carts , as Pharaoh had commanded , and he also gave them provisions for their journey .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	22	To each of them he gave new clothing , but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels [ b ] of silver and five sets of clothes .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	23	And this is what he sent to his father : ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt , and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	24	Then he sent his brothers away , and as they were leaving he said to them , ‘ Don ’ t quarrel on the way ! ’
NIVUK	Genesis	45	25	So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	26	They told him , ‘ Joseph is still alive ! In fact , he is ruler of all Egypt. ’ Jacob was stunned ; he did not believe them .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	27	But when they told him everything Joseph had said to them , and when he saw the carts Joseph had sent to carry him back , the spirit of their father Jacob revived .
NIVUK	Genesis	45	28	And Israel said , ‘ I ’ m convinced ! My son Joseph is still alive . I will go and see him before I die. ’ Footnotes - Genesis 45:7 Or save you as a great band of survivors - Genesis 45:22 That is , about 3.5 kilograms Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Genesis	46	46	So Israel set out with all that was his , and when he reached Beersheba , he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac .
NIVUK	Genesis	46	2	And God spoke to Israel in a vision at night and said , ‘ Jacob ! Jacob ! ’ ‘ Here I am , ’ he replied .
NIVUK	Genesis	46	3	‘ I am God , the God of your father , ’ he said . ‘ Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt , for I will make you into a great nation there .
NIVUK	Genesis	46	4	I will go down to Egypt with you , and I will surely bring you back again . And Joseph ’ s own hand will close your eyes. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	46	5	Then Jacob left Beersheba , and Israel ’ s sons took their father Jacob and their children and their wives in the carts that Pharaoh had sent to transport him .
NIVUK	Genesis	46	6	So Jacob and all his offspring went to Egypt , taking with them their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan .
NIVUK	Genesis	46	7	Jacob brought with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons and his daughters and granddaughters – all his offspring .

NIVUK	Genesis	46	27	With the two sons [ f ] who had been born to Joseph in Egypt , the members of Jacob ’ s family , which went to Egypt , were seventy [ g ] in all .

NIVUK	Genesis	47	13	There was no food , however , in the whole region because the famine was severe ; both Egypt and Canaan wasted away because of the famine .
NIVUK	Genesis	47	14	Joseph collected all the money that was to be found in Egypt and Canaan in payment for the grain they were buying , and he brought it to Pharaoh ’ s palace .
NIVUK	Genesis	47	15	When the money of the people of Egypt and Canaan was gone , all Egypt came to Joseph and said , ‘ Give us food . Why should we die before your eyes ? Our money is all gone. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	47	16	‘ Then bring your livestock , ’ said Joseph . ‘ I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock , since your money is gone. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	47	17	So they brought their livestock to Joseph , and he gave them food in exchange for their horses , their sheep and goats , their cattle and donkeys . And he brought them through that year with food in exchange for all their livestock .
NIVUK	Genesis	47	18	When that year was over , they came to him the following year and said , ‘ We can not hide from our lord the fact that since our money is gone and our livestock belongs to you , there is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land .
NIVUK	Genesis	47	19	Why should we perish before your eyes – we and our land as well ? Buy us and our land in exchange for food , and we with our land will be in bondage to Pharaoh . Give us seed so that we may live and not die , and that the land may not become desolate. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	47	20	So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh . The Egyptians , one and all , sold their fields , because the famine was too severe for them . The land became Pharaoh ’ s ,
NIVUK	Genesis	47	21	and Joseph reduced the people to servitude , [ c ] from one end of Egypt to the other .
NIVUK	Genesis	47	22	However , he did not buy the land of the priests , because they received a fixed allowance from Pharaoh and had food enough from the allowance Pharaoh gave them . That is why they did not sell their land .
NIVUK	Genesis	47	23	Joseph said to the people , ‘ Now that I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh , here is seed for you so you can plant the ground .
NIVUK	Genesis	47	24	But when the crop comes in , give a fifth of it to Pharaoh . The other four-fifths you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and your children. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	47	25	‘ You have saved our lives , ’ they said . ‘ May we find favour in the eyes of our lord ; we will be in bondage to Pharaoh. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	47	26	So Joseph established it as a law concerning land in Egypt – still in force today – that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh . It was only the land of the priests that did not become Pharaoh ’ s .
NIVUK	Genesis	47	27	Now the Israelites settled in Egypt in the region of Goshen . They acquired property there and were fruitful and increased greatly in number .
NIVUK	Genesis	47	28	Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years , and the years of his life were a hundred and forty-seven .
NIVUK	Genesis	47	29	When the time drew near for Israel to die , he called for his son Joseph and said to him , ‘ If I have found favour in your eyes , put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will show me kindness and faithfulness . Do not bury me in Egypt ,
NIVUK	Genesis	47	30	but when I rest with my fathers , carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried. ’ ‘ I will do as you say , ’ he said .
NIVUK	Genesis	47	31	‘ Swear to me , ’ he said . Then Joseph swore to him , and Israel worshipped as he leaned on the top of his staff .

NIVUK	Genesis	48	48	Some time later Joseph was told , ‘ Your father is ill. ’ So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with him .
NIVUK	Genesis	48	2	When Jacob was told , ‘ Your son Joseph has come to you , ’ Israel rallied his strength and sat up on the bed .
NIVUK	Genesis	48	3	Jacob said to Joseph , ‘ God Almighty [ a ] appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan , and there he blessed me
NIVUK	Genesis	48	4	and said to me , “ I am going to make you fruitful and increase your numbers . I will make you a community of peoples , and I will give this land as an everlasting possession to your descendants after you. ”
NIVUK	Genesis	48	5	‘ Now then , your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here will be reckoned as mine ; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine , just as Reuben and Simeon are mine .
NIVUK	Genesis	48	6	Any children born to you after them will be yours ; in the territory they inherit they will be reckoned under the names of their brothers .
NIVUK	Genesis	48	7	As I was returning from Paddan , [ b ] to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan while we were still on the way , a little distance from Ephrath . So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath ’ ( that is , Bethlehem ) .
NIVUK	Genesis	48	8	When Israel saw the sons of Joseph , he asked , ‘ Who are these ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	48	9	‘ They are the sons God has given me here , ’ Joseph said to his father . Then Israel said , ‘ Bring them to me so that I may bless them. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	48	10	Now Israel ’ s eyes were failing because of old age , and he could hardly see . So Joseph brought his sons close to him , and his father kissed them and embraced them .
NIVUK	Genesis	48	11	Israel said to Joseph , ‘ I never expected to see your face again , and now God has allowed me to see your children too. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	48	12	Then Joseph removed them from Israel ’ s knees and bowed down with his face to the ground .
NIVUK	Genesis	48	13	And Joseph took both of them , Ephraim on his right towards Israel ’ s left hand and Manasseh on his left towards Israel ’ s right hand , and brought them close to him .
NIVUK	Genesis	48	14	But Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraim ’ s head , though he was the younger , and crossing his arms , he put his left hand on Manasseh ’ s head , even though Manasseh was the firstborn .
NIVUK	Genesis	48	15	Then he blessed Joseph and said , ‘ May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked faithfully , the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day ,
NIVUK	Genesis	48	16	the Angel who has delivered me from all harm – may he bless these boys . May they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac , and may they increase greatly on the earth. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	48	17	When Joseph saw his father placing his right hand on Ephraim ’ s head he was displeased ; so he took hold of his father ’ s hand to move it from Ephraim ’ s head to Manasseh ’ s head .
NIVUK	Genesis	48	18	Joseph said to him , ‘ No , my father , this one is the firstborn ; put your right hand on his head. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	48	19	But his father refused and said , ‘ I know , my son , I know . He too will become a people , and he too will become great . Nevertheless , his younger brother will be greater than he , and his descendants will become a group of nations. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	48	20	He blessed them that day and said , ‘ In your [ c ] name will Israel pronounce this blessing : “ May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh. ” ’ So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh .
NIVUK	Genesis	48	21	Then Israel said to Joseph , ‘ I am about to die , but God will be with you [ d ] and take you [ e ] back to the land of your [ f ] fathers .
NIVUK	Genesis	48	22	And to you I give one more ridge of land [ g ] than to your brothers , the ridge I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow. ’ Footnotes - Genesis 48:3 Hebrew El-Shaddai - Genesis 48:7 That is , North-west Mesopotamia - Genesis 48:20 The Hebrew is singular . - Genesis 48:21 The Hebrew is plural . - Genesis 48:21 The Hebrew is plural . - Genesis 48:21 The Hebrew is plural . - Genesis 48:22 The Hebrew for ridge of land is identical with the place name Shechem .

NIVUK	Genesis	50	50	Joseph threw himself on his father and wept over him and kissed him .
NIVUK	Genesis	50	2	Then Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel . So the physicians embalmed him ,
NIVUK	Genesis	50	3	taking a full forty days , for that was the time required for embalming . And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days .
NIVUK	Genesis	50	4	When the days of mourning had passed , Joseph said to Pharaoh ’ s court , ‘ If I have found favour in your eyes , speak to Pharaoh for me . Tell him ,
NIVUK	Genesis	50	5	“ My father made me swear an oath and said , ‘ I am about to die ; bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan. ’ Now let me go up and bury my father ; then I will return. ” ’
NIVUK	Genesis	50	6	Pharaoh said , ‘ Go up and bury your father , as he made you swear to do. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	50	7	So Joseph went up to bury his father . All Pharaoh ’ s officials accompanied him – the dignitaries of his court and all the dignitaries of Egypt –
NIVUK	Genesis	50	8	besides all the members of Joseph ’ s household and his brothers and those belonging to his father ’ s household . Only their children and their flocks and herds were left in Goshen .
NIVUK	Genesis	50	9	Chariots and horsemen [ a ] also went up with him . It was a very large company .
NIVUK	Genesis	50	10	When they reached the threshing-floor of Atad , near the Jordan , they lamented loudly and bitterly ; and there Joseph observed a seven-day period of mourning for his father .
NIVUK	Genesis	50	11	When the Canaanites who lived there saw the mourning at the threshing-floor of Atad , they said , ‘ The Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning. ’ That is why that place near the Jordan is called Abel Mizraim . [ b ]
NIVUK	Genesis	50	12	So Jacob ’ s sons did as he had commanded them :
NIVUK	Genesis	50	13	they carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah , near Mamre , which Abraham had bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite .
NIVUK	Genesis	50	14	After burying his father , Joseph returned to Egypt , together with his brothers and all the others who had gone with him to bury his father . Joseph reassures his brothers
NIVUK	Genesis	50	15	When Joseph ’ s brothers saw that their father was dead , they said , ‘ What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him ? ’
NIVUK	Genesis	50	16	So they sent word to Joseph , saying , ‘ Your father left these instructions before he died :
NIVUK	Genesis	50	17	“ This is what you are to say to Joseph : I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly. ” Now please forgive the sins of the servants of the God of your father. ’ When their message came to him , Joseph wept .
NIVUK	Genesis	50	18	His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him . ‘ We are your slaves , ’ they said .
NIVUK	Genesis	50	19	But Joseph said to them , ‘ Don ’ t be afraid . Am I in the place of God ?
NIVUK	Genesis	50	20	You intended to harm me , but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done , the saving of many lives .
NIVUK	Genesis	50	21	So then , don ’ t be afraid . I will provide for you and your children. ’ And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them . The death of Joseph
NIVUK	Genesis	50	22	Joseph stayed in Egypt , along with all his father ’ s family . He lived a hundred and ten years
NIVUK	Genesis	50	23	and saw the third generation of Ephraim ’ s children . Also the children of Makir son of Manasseh were placed at birth on Joseph ’ s knees . [ c ]
NIVUK	Genesis	50	24	Then Joseph said to his brothers , ‘ I am about to die . But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham , Isaac and Jacob. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	50	25	And Joseph made the Israelites swear an oath and said , ‘ God will surely come to your aid , and then you must carry my bones up from this place. ’
NIVUK	Genesis	50	26	So Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten . And after they embalmed him , he was placed in a coffin in Egypt .

NIVUK	Exodus	1	1	These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob , each with his family :
NIVUK	Exodus	1	2	Reuben , Simeon , Levi and Judah ;
NIVUK	Exodus	1	3	Issachar , Zebulun and Benjamin ;
NIVUK	Exodus	1	4	Dan and Naphtali ; Gad and Asher .
NIVUK	Exodus	1	5	The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy [ a ] in all ; Joseph was already in Egypt .
NIVUK	Exodus	1	6	Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died ,
NIVUK	Exodus	1	7	but the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful ; they multiplied greatly , increased in numbers and became so numerous that the land was filled with them .
NIVUK	Exodus	1	8	Then a new king , to whom Joseph meant nothing , came to power in Egypt .
NIVUK	Exodus	1	9	‘ Look , ’ he said to his people , ‘ the Israelites have become far too numerous for us .
NIVUK	Exodus	1	10	Come , we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and , if war breaks out , will join our enemies , fight against us and leave the country. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	1	11	So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labour , and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh .
NIVUK	Exodus	1	12	But the more they were oppressed , the more they multiplied and spread ; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites
NIVUK	Exodus	1	13	and worked them ruthlessly .
NIVUK	Exodus	1	14	They made their lives bitter with harsh labour in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields ; in all their harsh labour , the Egyptians worked them ruthlessly .
NIVUK	Exodus	1	15	The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives , whose names were Shiphrah and Puah ,
NIVUK	Exodus	1	16	‘ When you are helping the Hebrew women during childbirth on the delivery stool , if you see that the baby is a boy , kill him ; but if it is a girl , let her live. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	1	17	The midwives , however , feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do ; they let the boys live .
NIVUK	Exodus	1	18	Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them , ‘ Why have you done this ? Why have you let the boys live ? ’
NIVUK	Exodus	1	19	The midwives answered Pharaoh , ‘ Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women ; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	1	20	So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous .
NIVUK	Exodus	1	21	And because the midwives feared God , he gave them families of their own .
NIVUK	Exodus	1	22	Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people : ‘ Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile , but let every girl live. ’ Footnotes - Exodus 1:5 Masoretic Text ( see also Gen. 46:27 ) ; Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint ( see also Acts 7:14 and note at Gen. 46:27 ) seventy-five Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Exodus	2	2	and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son . When she saw that he was a fine child , she hid him for three months .
NIVUK	Exodus	2	3	But when she could hide him no longer , she got a papyrus basket [ a ] for him and coated it with tar and pitch . Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile .
NIVUK	Exodus	2	4	His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him .
NIVUK	Exodus	2	5	Then Pharaoh ’ s daughter went down to the Nile to bathe , and her attendants were walking along the river-bank . She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her female slave to get it .
NIVUK	Exodus	2	6	She opened it and saw the baby . He was crying , and she felt sorry for him . ‘ This is one of the Hebrew babies , ’ she said .
NIVUK	Exodus	2	7	Then his sister asked Pharaoh ’ s daughter , ‘ Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you ? ’
NIVUK	Exodus	2	8	‘ Yes , go , ’ she answered . So the girl went and got the baby ’ s mother .
NIVUK	Exodus	2	9	Pharaoh ’ s daughter said to her , ‘ Take this baby and nurse him for me , and I will pay you. ’ So the woman took the baby and nursed him .
NIVUK	Exodus	2	10	When the child grew older , she took him to Pharaoh ’ s daughter and he became her son . She named him Moses , [ b ] saying , ‘ I drew him out of the water. ’ Moses flees to Midian
NIVUK	Exodus	2	11	One day , after Moses had grown up , he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labour . He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew , one of his own people .
NIVUK	Exodus	2	12	Looking this way and that and seeing no one , he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand .
NIVUK	Exodus	2	13	The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting . He asked the one in the wrong , ‘ Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew ? ’
NIVUK	Exodus	2	14	The man said , ‘ Who made you ruler and judge over us ? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian ? ’ Then Moses was afraid and thought , ‘ What I did must have become known. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	2	15	When Pharaoh heard of this , he tried to kill Moses , but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian , where he sat down by a well .
NIVUK	Exodus	2	16	Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters , and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father ’ s flock .
NIVUK	Exodus	2	17	Some shepherds came along and drove them away , but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock .
NIVUK	Exodus	2	18	When the girls returned to Reuel their father , he asked them , ‘ Why have you returned so early today ? ’
NIVUK	Exodus	2	19	They answered , ‘ An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds . He even drew water for us and watered the flock. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	2	20	‘ And where is he ? ’ Reuel asked his daughters . ‘ Why did you leave him ? Invite him to have something to eat. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	2	21	Moses agreed to stay with the man , who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage .
NIVUK	Exodus	2	22	Zipporah gave birth to a son , and Moses named him Gershom , [ c ] saying , ‘ I have become a foreigner in a foreign land. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	2	23	During that long period , the king of Egypt died . The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out , and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God .
NIVUK	Exodus	2	24	God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham , with Isaac and with Jacob .
NIVUK	Exodus	2	25	So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them . Footnotes - Exodus 2:3 The Hebrew can also mean ark , as in Gen. 6:14 . - Exodus 2:10 Moses sounds like the Hebrew for draw out . - Exodus 2:22 Gershom sounds like the Hebrew for a foreigner there .

NIVUK	Exodus	3	3	So Moses thought , ‘ I will go over and see this strange sight – why the bush does not burn up. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	3	2	There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush . Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up .
NIVUK	Exodus	3	4	When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look , God called to him from within the bush , ‘ Moses ! Moses ! ’ And Moses said , ‘ Here I am. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	3	5	‘ Do not come any closer , ’ God said . ‘ Take off your sandals , for the place where you are standing is holy ground. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	3	6	Then he said , ‘ I am the God of your father , [ a ] the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. ’ At this , Moses hid his face , because he was afraid to look at God .
NIVUK	Exodus	3	7	The Lord said , ‘ I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt . I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers , and I am concerned about their suffering .
NIVUK	Exodus	3	8	So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land , a land flowing with milk and honey – the home of the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites and Jebusites .
NIVUK	Exodus	3	9	And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me , and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them .
NIVUK	Exodus	3	10	So now , go . I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	3	11	But Moses said to God , ‘ Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt ? ’
NIVUK	Exodus	3	12	And God said , ‘ I will be with you . And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you : when you have brought the people out of Egypt , you [ b ] will worship God on this mountain. ’

NIVUK	Exodus	4	3	The Lord said , ‘ Throw it on the ground. ’ Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake , and he ran from it .
NIVUK	Exodus	4	5	‘ This , ’ said the Lord , ‘ is so that they may believe that the Lord , the God of their fathers – the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob – has appeared to you. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	4	6	Then the Lord said , ‘ Put your hand inside your cloak. ’ So Moses put his hand into his cloak , and when he took it out , the skin was leprous [ a ] – it had become as white as snow .
NIVUK	Exodus	4	7	‘ Now put it back into your cloak , ’ he said . So Moses put his hand back into his cloak , and when he took it out , it was restored , like the rest of his flesh .
NIVUK	Exodus	4	8	Then the Lord said , ‘ If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first sign , they may believe the second .
NIVUK	Exodus	4	9	But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you , take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground . The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	4	10	Moses said to the Lord , ‘ Pardon your servant , Lord . I have never been eloquent , neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant . I am slow of speech and tongue. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	4	11	The Lord said to him , ‘ Who gave human beings their mouths ? Who makes them deaf or mute ? Who gives them sight or makes them blind ? Is it not I , the Lord ?

NIVUK	Exodus	4	15	You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth ; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do .
NIVUK	Exodus	4	16	He will speak to the people for you , and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him .
NIVUK	Exodus	4	17	But take this staff in your hand so that you can perform the signs with it. ’ Moses returns to Egypt
NIVUK	Exodus	4	18	Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him , ‘ Let me return to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive. ’ Jethro said , ‘ Go , and I wish you well. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	4	19	Now the Lord had said to Moses in Midian , ‘ Go back to Egypt , for all those who wanted to kill you are dead. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	4	20	So Moses took his wife and sons , put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt . And he took the staff of God in his hand .
NIVUK	Exodus	4	21	The Lord said to Moses , ‘ When you return to Egypt , see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do . But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go .
NIVUK	Exodus	4	22	Then say to Pharaoh , “ This is what the Lord says : Israel is my firstborn son ,
NIVUK	Exodus	4	23	and I told you , ‘ Let my son go , so that he may worship me. ’ But you refused to let him go ; so I will kill your firstborn son. ” ’
NIVUK	Exodus	4	24	At a lodging place on the way , the Lord met Moses [ b ] and was about to kill him .
NIVUK	Exodus	4	25	But Zipporah took a flint knife , cut off her son ’ s foreskin and touched Moses ’ feet with it . [ c ] ‘ Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me , ’ she said .
NIVUK	Exodus	4	26	So the Lord let him alone . ( At that time she said ‘ bridegroom of blood ’ , referring to circumcision . )
NIVUK	Exodus	4	27	The Lord said to Aaron , ‘ Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. ’ So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him .
NIVUK	Exodus	4	28	Then Moses told Aaron everything the Lord had sent him to say , and also about all the signs he had commanded him to perform .
NIVUK	Exodus	4	29	Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites ,
NIVUK	Exodus	4	30	and Aaron told them everything the Lord had said to Moses . He also performed the signs before the people ,

NIVUK	Exodus	5	5	Then Pharaoh said , ‘ Look , the people of the land are now numerous , and you are stopping them from working. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	5	2	Pharaoh said , ‘ Who is the Lord , that I should obey him and let Israel go ? I do not know the Lord and I will not let Israel go. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	5	3	Then they said , ‘ The God of the Hebrews has met with us . Now let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God , or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	5	4	But the king of Egypt said , ‘ Moses and Aaron , why are you taking the people away from their labour ? Get back to your work ! ’
NIVUK	Exodus	5	6	That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people :

NIVUK	Exodus	5	8	But require them to make the same number of bricks as before ; don ’ t reduce the quota . They are lazy ; that is why they are crying out , “ Let us go and sacrifice to our God. ”
NIVUK	Exodus	5	9	Make the work harder for the people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	5	10	Then the slave drivers and the overseers went out and said to the people , ‘ This is what Pharaoh says : “ I will not give you any more straw .
NIVUK	Exodus	5	11	Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it , but your work will not be reduced at all. ” ’
NIVUK	Exodus	5	12	So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw .
NIVUK	Exodus	5	13	The slave drivers kept pressing them , saying , ‘ Complete the work required of you for each day , just as when you had straw. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	5	14	And Pharaoh ’ s slave drivers beat the Israelite overseers they had appointed , demanding , ‘ Why haven ’ t you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today , as before ? ’
NIVUK	Exodus	5	15	Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh : ‘ Why have you treated your servants this way ?
NIVUK	Exodus	5	16	Your servants are given no straw , yet we are told , “ Make bricks ! ” Your servants are being beaten , but the fault is with your own people. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	5	17	Pharaoh said , ‘ Lazy , that ’ s what you are – lazy ! That is why you keep saying , “ Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord. ”
NIVUK	Exodus	5	18	Now get to work . You will not be given any straw , yet you must produce your full quota of bricks. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	5	19	The Israelite overseers realised they were in trouble when they were told , ‘ You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	5	20	When they left Pharaoh , they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them ,
NIVUK	Exodus	5	21	and they said , ‘ May the Lord look on you and judge you ! You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us. ’ God promises deliverance
NIVUK	Exodus	5	22	Moses returned to the Lord and said , ‘ Why , Lord , why have you brought trouble on this people ? Is this why you sent me ?

NIVUK	Exodus	8	5	Then the Lord said to Moses , ‘ Tell Aaron , “ Stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals and ponds , and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt. ” ’
NIVUK	Exodus	8	6	So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt , and the frogs came up and covered the land .
NIVUK	Exodus	8	7	But the magicians did the same things by their secret arts ; they also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt .
NIVUK	Exodus	8	9	Moses said to Pharaoh , ‘ I leave to you the honour of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials and your people that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs , except for those that remain in the Nile. ’

NIVUK	Exodus	8	11	The frogs will leave you and your houses , your officials and your people ; they will remain only in the Nile. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	8	12	After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh , Moses cried out to the Lord about the frogs he had brought on Pharaoh .
NIVUK	Exodus	8	13	And the Lord did what Moses asked . The frogs died in the houses , in the courtyards and in the fields .

NIVUK	Exodus	8	17	They did this , and when Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground , gnats came on people and animals . All the dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats .
NIVUK	Exodus	8	18	But when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts , they could not . Since the gnats were on people and animals everywhere ,
NIVUK	Exodus	8	19	the magicians said to Pharaoh , ‘ This is the finger of God. ’ But Pharaoh ’ s heart was hard and he would not listen , just as the Lord had said . The plague of flies
NIVUK	Exodus	8	20	Then the Lord said to Moses , ‘ Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the river and say to him , “ This is what the Lord says : let my people go , so that they may worship me .

NIVUK	Exodus	8	24	And the Lord did this . Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh ’ s palace and into the houses of his officials ; throughout Egypt the land was ruined by the flies .
NIVUK	Exodus	8	25	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said , ‘ Go , sacrifice to your God here in the land. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	8	26	But Moses said , ‘ That would not be right . The sacrifices we offer the Lord our God would be detestable to the Egyptians . And if we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes , will they not stone us ?
NIVUK	Exodus	8	27	We must take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God , as he commands us. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	8	28	Pharaoh said , ‘ I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the Lord your God in the wilderness , but you must not go very far . Now pray for me. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	8	29	Moses answered , ‘ As soon as I leave you , I will pray to the Lord , and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his people . Only let Pharaoh be sure that he does not act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	8	30	Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord ,

NIVUK	Exodus	9	5	The Lord set a time and said , ‘ Tomorrow the Lord will do this in the land. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	9	6	And the next day the Lord did it : all the livestock of the Egyptians died , but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died .
NIVUK	Exodus	9	7	Pharaoh investigated and found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died . Yet his heart was unyielding and he would not let the people go . The plague of boils
NIVUK	Exodus	9	8	Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron , ‘ Take handfuls of soot from a furnace and let Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh .

NIVUK	Exodus	9	12	But the Lord hardened Pharaoh ’ s heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron , just as the Lord had said to Moses . The plague of hail
NIVUK	Exodus	9	13	Then the Lord said to Moses , ‘ Get up early in the morning , confront Pharaoh and say to him , “ This is what the Lord , the God of the Hebrews , says : let my people go , so that they may worship me ,
NIVUK	Exodus	9	14	or this time I will send the full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people , so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth .
NIVUK	Exodus	9	15	For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth .
NIVUK	Exodus	9	16	But I have raised you up [ a ] for this very purpose , that I might show you my power and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth .

NIVUK	Exodus	9	19	Give an order now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter , because the hail will fall on every person and animal that has not been brought in and is still out in the field , and they will die. ” ’
NIVUK	Exodus	9	20	Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the Lord hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside .
NIVUK	Exodus	9	21	But those who ignored the word of the Lord left their slaves and livestock in the field .
NIVUK	Exodus	9	22	Then the Lord said to Moses , ‘ Stretch out your hand towards the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt – on people and animals and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	9	23	When Moses stretched out his staff towards the sky , the Lord sent thunder and hail , and lightning flashed down to the ground . So the Lord rained hail on the land of Egypt ;
NIVUK	Exodus	9	24	hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth . It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation .
NIVUK	Exodus	9	25	Throughout Egypt hail struck everything in the fields – both people and animals ; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree .
NIVUK	Exodus	9	26	The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen , where the Israelites were .
NIVUK	Exodus	9	27	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron . ‘ This time I have sinned , ’ he said to them . ‘ The Lord is in the right , and I and my people are in the wrong .
NIVUK	Exodus	9	28	Pray to the Lord , for we have had enough thunder and hail . I will let you go ; you don ’ t have to stay any longer. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	9	29	Moses replied , ‘ When I have gone out of the city , I will spread out my hands in prayer to the Lord . The thunder will stop and there will be no more hail , so you may know that the earth is the Lord ’ s .
NIVUK	Exodus	9	30	But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the Lord God. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	9	31	( The flax and barley were destroyed , since the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bloom .
NIVUK	Exodus	9	32	The wheat and spelt , however , were not destroyed , because they ripen later . )

NIVUK	Exodus	10	10	Pharaoh said , ‘ The Lord be with you – if I let you go , along with your women and children ! Clearly you are bent on evil . [ a ]
NIVUK	Exodus	10	2	that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them , and that you may know that I am the Lord. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	10	3	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of the Hebrews , says : “ How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me ? Let my people go , so that they may worship me .
NIVUK	Exodus	10	4	If you refuse to let them go , I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow .
NIVUK	Exodus	10	5	They will cover the face of the ground so that it can not be seen . They will devour what little you have left after the hail , including every tree that is growing in your fields .
NIVUK	Exodus	10	6	They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians – something neither your parents nor your ancestors have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now. ” ’ Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh .
NIVUK	Exodus	10	7	Pharaoh ’ s officials said to him , ‘ How long will this man be a snare to us ? Let the people go , so that they may worship the Lord their God . Do you not yet realise that Egypt is ruined ? ’
NIVUK	Exodus	10	8	Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh . ‘ Go , worship the Lord your God , ’ he said . ‘ But tell me who will be going. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	10	9	Moses answered , ‘ We will go with our young and our old , with our sons and our daughters , and with our flocks and herds , because we are to celebrate a festival to the Lord. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	10	11	No ! Let only the men go and worship the Lord , since that ’ s what you have been asking for. ’ Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh ’ s presence .
NIVUK	Exodus	10	12	And the Lord said to Moses , ‘ Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields , everything left by the hail. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	10	13	So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt , and the Lord made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night . By morning the wind had brought the locusts ;
NIVUK	Exodus	10	14	they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers . Never before had there been such a plague of locusts , nor will there ever be again .
NIVUK	Exodus	10	15	They covered all the ground until it was black . They devoured all that was left after the hail – everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees . Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt .
NIVUK	Exodus	10	16	Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said , ‘ I have sinned against the Lord your God and against you .
NIVUK	Exodus	10	17	Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the Lord your God to take this deadly plague away from me. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	10	18	Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord .
NIVUK	Exodus	10	19	And the Lord changed the wind to a very strong west wind , which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea . [ b ] Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt .

NIVUK	Exodus	10	22	So Moses stretched out his hand towards the sky , and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days .
NIVUK	Exodus	10	23	No one could see anyone else or move about for three days . Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived .
NIVUK	Exodus	10	24	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said , ‘ Go , worship the Lord . Even your women and children may go with you ; only leave your flocks and herds behind. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	10	25	But Moses said , ‘ You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the Lord our God .
NIVUK	Exodus	10	26	Our livestock too must go with us ; not a hoof is to be left behind . We have to use some of them in worshipping the Lord our God , and until we get there we will not know what we are to use to worship the Lord. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	10	27	But the Lord hardened Pharaoh ’ s heart , and he was not willing to let them go .
NIVUK	Exodus	10	28	Pharaoh said to Moses , ‘ Get out of my sight ! Make sure you do not appear before me again ! The day you see my face you will die. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	10	29	‘ Just as you say , ’ Moses replied . ‘ I will never appear before you again. ’ Footnotes - Exodus 10:10 Or Be careful , trouble is in store for you ! - Exodus 10:19 Or the Sea of Reeds Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Exodus	13	19	Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the Israelites swear an oath . He had said , ‘ God will surely come to your aid , and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place. ’ [ b ]

NIVUK	Exodus	16	7	and in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord , because he has heard your grumbling against him . Who are we , that you should grumble against us ? ’
NIVUK	Exodus	16	8	Moses also said , ‘ You will know that it was the Lord when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning , because he has heard your grumbling against him . Who are we ? You are not grumbling against us , but against the Lord. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	16	9	Then Moses told Aaron , ‘ Say to the entire Israelite community , “ Come before the Lord , for he has heard your grumbling. ” ’
NIVUK	Exodus	16	10	While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community , they looked towards the desert , and there was the glory of the Lord appearing in the cloud .
NIVUK	Exodus	16	11	The Lord said to Moses ,
NIVUK	Exodus	16	12	‘ I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites . Tell them , “ At twilight you will eat meat , and in the morning you will be filled with bread . Then you will know that I am the Lord your God. ” ’

NIVUK	Exodus	16	17	The Israelites did as they were told ; some gathered much , some little .
NIVUK	Exodus	16	18	,
NIVUK	Exodus	16	19	Then Moses said to them , ‘ No one is to keep any of it until morning. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	16	20	However , some of them paid no attention to Moses ; they kept part of it until morning , but it was full of maggots and began to smell . So Moses was angry with them .
NIVUK	Exodus	16	21	Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed , and when the sun grew hot , it melted away .
NIVUK	Exodus	16	22	On the sixth day , they gathered twice as much – two omers [ b ] for each person – and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses .
NIVUK	Exodus	16	23	He said to them , ‘ This is what the Lord commanded : “ Tomorrow is to be a day of sabbath rest , a holy sabbath to the Lord . So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil . Save whatever is left and keep it until morning. ” ’
NIVUK	Exodus	16	24	So they saved it until morning , as Moses commanded , and it did not stink or get maggots in it .
NIVUK	Exodus	16	25	‘ Eat it today , ’ Moses said , ‘ because today is a sabbath to the Lord . You will not find any of it on the ground today .
NIVUK	Exodus	16	26	Six days you are to gather it , but on the seventh day , the Sabbath , there will not be any. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	16	27	Nevertheless , some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it , but they found none .
NIVUK	Exodus	16	28	Then the Lord said to Moses , ‘ How long will you [ c ] refuse to keep my commands and my instructions ?
NIVUK	Exodus	16	29	Bear in mind that the Lord has given you the Sabbath ; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days . Everyone is to stay where they are on the seventh day ; no one is to go out. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	16	30	So the people rested on the seventh day .
NIVUK	Exodus	16	31	The people of Israel called the bread manna . [ d ] It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey .
NIVUK	Exodus	16	32	,

NIVUK	Exodus	17	14	Then the Lord said to Moses , ‘ Write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it , because I will completely blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	17	15	Moses built an altar and called it The Lord is my Banner .

NIVUK	Exodus	18	16	Whenever they have a dispute , it is brought to me , and I decide between the parties and inform them of God ’ s decrees and instructions. ’

NIVUK	Exodus	32	11	But Moses sought the favour of the Lord his God . ‘ Lord , ’ he said , ‘ why should your anger burn against your people , whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand ?
NIVUK	Exodus	32	12	Why should the Egyptians say , “ It was with evil intent that he brought them out , to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth ” ? Turn from your fierce anger ; relent and do not bring disaster on your people .

NIVUK	Exodus	32	19	When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing , his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands , breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain .
NIVUK	Exodus	32	20	And he took the calf the people had made and burned it in the fire ; then he ground it to powder , scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it .

NIVUK	Exodus	32	26	So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said , ‘ Whoever is for the Lord , come to me. ’ And all the Levites rallied to him .
NIVUK	Exodus	32	27	Then he said to them , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : “ Each man strap a sword to his side . Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other , each killing his brother and friend and neighbour. ” ’

NIVUK	Exodus	33	4	When the people heard these distressing words , they began to mourn and no one put on any ornaments .

NIVUK	Exodus	33	10	Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent , they all stood and worshipped , each at the entrance to their tent .
NIVUK	Exodus	33	11	The Lord would speak to Moses face to face , as one speaks to a friend . Then Moses would return to the camp , but his young assistant Joshua son of Nun did not leave the tent . Moses and the glory of the Lord
NIVUK	Exodus	33	12	Moses said to the Lord , ‘ You have been telling me , “ Lead these people , ” but you have not let me know whom you will send with me . You have said , “ I know you by name and you have found favour with me. ”

NIVUK	Exodus	33	14	The Lord replied , ‘ My Presence will go with you , and I will give you rest. ’

NIVUK	Exodus	33	18	Then Moses said , ‘ Now show me your glory. ’
NIVUK	Exodus	33	19	And the Lord said , ‘ I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you , and I will proclaim my name , the Lord , in your presence . I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion .

NIVUK	Leviticus	25	18	‘ “ Follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws , and you will live safely in the land .

NIVUK	Leviticus	25	21	I will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years .

NIVUK	Leviticus	25	28	But if they do not acquire the means to repay , what was sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee . It will be returned in the Jubilee , and they can then go back to their property .

NIVUK	Leviticus	25	30	If it is not redeemed before a full year has passed , the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and the buyer ’ s descendants . It is not to be returned in the Jubilee .
NIVUK	Leviticus	25	31	But houses in villages without walls round them are to be considered as belonging to the open country . They can be redeemed , and they are to be returned in the Jubilee .
NIVUK	Leviticus	25	32	‘ “ The Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the Levitical towns , which they possess .
NIVUK	Leviticus	25	33	So the property of the Levites is redeemable – that is , a house sold in any town they hold – and is to be returned in the Jubilee , because the houses in the towns of the Levites are their property among the Israelites .

NIVUK	Leviticus	25	49	an uncle or a cousin or any blood-relative in their clan may redeem them . Or if they prosper , they may redeem themselves .
NIVUK	Leviticus	25	50	They and their buyer are to count the time from the year they sold themselves up to the Year of Jubilee . The price for their release is to be based on the rate paid to a hired worker for that number of years .

NIVUK	Leviticus	25	52	If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee , they are to compute that and pay for their redemption accordingly .
NIVUK	Leviticus	25	53	They are to be treated as workers hired from year to year ; you must see to it that those to whom they owe service do not rule over them ruthlessly .

NIVUK	Numbers	5	13	so that another man has sexual relations with her , and this is hidden from her husband and her impurity is undetected ( since there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act ) ,
NIVUK	Numbers	5	14	and if feelings of jealousy come over her husband and he suspects his wife and she is impure – or if he is jealous and suspects her even though she is not impure –
NIVUK	Numbers	5	15	then he is to take his wife to the priest . He must also take an offering of a tenth of an ephah [ c ] of barley flour on her behalf . He must not pour olive oil on it or put incense on it , because it is a grain offering for jealousy , a reminder-offering to draw attention to wrongdoing .
NIVUK	Numbers	5	16	‘ “ The priest shall bring her and make her stand before the Lord .

NIVUK	Numbers	11	4	The rabble with them began to crave other food , and again the Israelites started wailing and said , ‘ If only we had meat to eat !

NIVUK	Numbers	11	6	But now we have lost our appetite ; we never see anything but this manna ! ’
NIVUK	Numbers	11	7	The manna was like coriander seed and looked like resin .
NIVUK	Numbers	11	8	The people went around gathering it , and then ground it in a hand-mill or crushed it in a mortar . They cooked it in a pot or made it into loaves . And it tasted like something made with olive oil .
NIVUK	Numbers	11	9	When the dew settled on the camp at night , the manna also came down .
NIVUK	Numbers	11	10	Moses heard the people of every family wailing at the entrance to their tents . The Lord became exceedingly angry , and Moses was troubled .
NIVUK	Numbers	11	12	Did I conceive all these people ? Did I give them birth ? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms , as a nurse carries an infant , to the land you promised on oath to their ancestors ?

NIVUK	Numbers	11	16	The Lord said to Moses : ‘ Bring me seventy of Israel ’ s elders who are known to you as leaders and officials among the people . Make them come to the tent of meeting , that they may stand there with you .
NIVUK	Numbers	11	17	I will come down and speak with you there , and I will take some of the power of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them . They will share the burden of the people with you so that you will not have to carry it alone .
NIVUK	Numbers	11	18	‘ Tell the people : “ Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow , when you will eat meat . The Lord heard you when you wailed , ‘ If only we had meat to eat ! We were better off in Egypt ! ’ Now the Lord will give you meat , and you will eat it .
NIVUK	Numbers	11	19	You will not eat it for just one day , or two days , or five , ten or twenty days ,
NIVUK	Numbers	11	20	but for a whole month – until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it – because you have rejected the Lord , who is among you , and have wailed before him , saying , ‘ Why did we ever leave Egypt ? ’ ” ’
NIVUK	Numbers	11	21	But Moses said , ‘ Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot , and you say , “ I will give them meat to eat for a whole month ! ”
NIVUK	Numbers	11	22	Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them ? Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them ? ’
NIVUK	Numbers	11	23	The Lord answered Moses , ‘ Is the Lord ’ s arm too short ? Now you will see whether or not what I say will come true for you. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	11	24	So Moses went out and told the people what the Lord had said . He brought together seventy of their elders and made them stand round the tent .
NIVUK	Numbers	11	25	Then the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke with him , and he took some of the power of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders . When the Spirit rested on them , they prophesied – but did not do so again .
NIVUK	Numbers	11	26	However , two men , whose names were Eldad and Medad , had remained in the camp . They were listed among the elders , but did not go out to the tent . Yet the Spirit also rested on them , and they prophesied in the camp .
NIVUK	Numbers	11	27	A young man ran and told Moses , ‘ Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	11	28	Joshua son of Nun , who had been Moses ’ assistant since youth , spoke up and said , ‘ Moses , my lord , stop them ! ’
NIVUK	Numbers	11	29	But Moses replied , ‘ Are you jealous for my sake ? I wish that all the Lord ’ s people were prophets and that the Lord would put his Spirit on them ! ’
NIVUK	Numbers	11	30	Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp .
NIVUK	Numbers	11	31	Now a wind went out from the Lord and drove quail in from the sea . It scattered them up to two cubits [ b ] deep all around the camp , as far as a day ’ s walk in any direction .
NIVUK	Numbers	11	32	All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered quail . No one gathered less than ten homers . [ c ] Then they spread them out all around the camp .
NIVUK	Numbers	11	33	But while the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed , the anger of the Lord burned against the people , and he struck them with a severe plague .
NIVUK	Numbers	11	34	Therefore the place was named Kibroth Hattaavah , [ d ] because there they buried the people who had craved other food .

NIVUK	Numbers	12	3	( Now Moses was a very humble man , more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth . )
NIVUK	Numbers	12	4	At once the Lord said to Moses , Aaron and Miriam , ‘ Come out to the tent of meeting , all three of you. ’ So the three of them went out .
NIVUK	Numbers	12	5	Then the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud ; he stood at the entrance to the tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam . When the two of them stepped forward ,
NIVUK	Numbers	12	6	he said , ‘ Listen to my words : ‘ When there is a prophet among you , I , the Lord , reveal myself to them in visions , I speak to them in dreams .

NIVUK	Numbers	12	11	and he said to Moses , ‘ Please , my lord , I ask you not to hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed .
NIVUK	Numbers	12	13	So Moses cried out to the Lord , ‘ Please , God , heal her ! ’
NIVUK	Numbers	12	14	The Lord replied to Moses , ‘ If her father had spat in her face , would she not have been in disgrace for seven days ? Confine her outside the camp for seven days ; after that she can be brought back. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	12	15	So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days , and the people did not move on till she was brought back .

NIVUK	Numbers	13	16	These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land . ( Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua . )
NIVUK	Numbers	13	17	When Moses sent them to explore Canaan , he said , ‘ Go up through the Negev and on into the hill country .
NIVUK	Numbers	13	18	See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak , few or many .

NIVUK	Numbers	13	21	So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob , towards Lebo Hamath .
NIVUK	Numbers	13	22	They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron , where Ahiman , Sheshai and Talmai , the descendants of Anak , lived . ( Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt . )

NIVUK	Numbers	13	25	At the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land . Report on the exploration
NIVUK	Numbers	13	26	They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran . There they reported to them and to the whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land .
NIVUK	Numbers	13	27	They gave Moses this account : ‘ We went into the land to which you sent us , and it does flow with milk and honey ! Here is its fruit .
NIVUK	Numbers	13	28	But the people who live there are powerful , and the cities are fortified and very large . We even saw descendants of Anak there .
NIVUK	Numbers	13	29	The Amalekites live in the Negev ; the Hittites , Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country ; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	13	30	Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said , ‘ We should go up and take possession of the land , for we can certainly do it. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	13	31	But the men who had gone up with him said , ‘ We can ’ t attack those people ; they are stronger than we are. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	13	32	And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored . They said , ‘ The land we explored devours those living in it . All the people we saw there are of great size .

They have already heard that you , Lord , are with these people and that you , Lord , have been seen face to face , that your cloud stays over them , and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	2	All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron , and the whole assembly said to them , ‘ If only we had died in Egypt ! Or in this wilderness !
NIVUK	Numbers	14	3	Why is the Lord bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword ? Our wives and children will be taken as plunder . Wouldn ’ t it be better for us to go back to Egypt ? ’
NIVUK	Numbers	14	4	And they said to each other , ‘ We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	14	5	Then Moses and Aaron fell face down in front of the whole Israelite assembly gathered there .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	6	Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh , who were among those who had explored the land , tore their clothes
NIVUK	Numbers	14	7	and said to the entire Israelite assembly , ‘ The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	8	If the Lord is pleased with us , he will lead us into that land , a land flowing with milk and honey , and will give it to us .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	9	Only do not rebel against the Lord . And do not be afraid of the people of the land , because we will devour them . Their protection is gone , but the Lord is with us . Do not be afraid of them. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	14	10	But the whole assembly talked about stoning them . Then the glory of the Lord appeared at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	11	The Lord said to Moses , ‘ How long will these people treat me with contempt ? How long will they refuse to believe in me , in spite of all the signs I have performed among them ?
NIVUK	Numbers	14	12	I will strike them down with a plague and destroy them , but I will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	14	13	Moses said to the Lord , ‘ Then the Egyptians will hear about it ! By your power you brought these people up from among them .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	15	If you put all these people to death , leaving none alive , the nations who have heard this report about you will say ,
NIVUK	Numbers	14	16	“ The Lord was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath , so he slaughtered them in the wilderness. ”
NIVUK	Numbers	14	17	‘ Now may the Lord ’ s strength be displayed , just as you have declared :
NIVUK	Numbers	14	18	“ The Lord is slow to anger , abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion . Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished ; he punishes the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation. ”
NIVUK	Numbers	14	19	In accordance with your great love , forgive the sin of these people , just as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	14	20	The Lord replied , ‘ I have forgiven them , as you asked .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	21	Nevertheless , as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the Lord fills the whole earth ,
NIVUK	Numbers	14	22	not one of those who saw my glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times –
NIVUK	Numbers	14	23	not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their ancestors . No one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	24	But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly , I will bring him into the land he went to , and his descendants will inherit it .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	25	Since the Amalekites and the Canaanites are living in the valleys , turn back tomorrow and set out towards the desert along the route to the Red Sea. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	Numbers	14	26	The Lord said to Moses and Aaron :
NIVUK	Numbers	14	27	‘ How long will this wicked community grumble against me ? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	28	So tell them , “ As surely as I live , declares the Lord , I will do to you the very thing I heard you say :
NIVUK	Numbers	14	29	in this wilderness your bodies will fall – every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	30	Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home , except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	31	As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder , I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	32	But you – your bodies will fall in this wilderness .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	33	Your children will be shepherds here for forty years , suffering for your unfaithfulness , until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	34	For forty years – one year for each of the forty days you explored the land – you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you. ”
NIVUK	Numbers	14	35	I , the Lord , have spoken , and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community , which has banded together against me . They will meet their end in this wilderness ; here they will die. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	14	36	So the men Moses had sent to explore the land , who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it –
NIVUK	Numbers	14	37	these men who were responsible for spreading the bad report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before the Lord .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	38	Of the men who went to explore the land , only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	39	When Moses reported this to all the Israelites , they mourned bitterly .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	40	Early the next morning they set out for the highest point in the hill country , saying , ‘ Now we are ready to go up to the land the Lord promised . Surely we have sinned ! ’
NIVUK	Numbers	14	41	But Moses said , ‘ Why are you disobeying the Lord ’ s command ? This will not succeed !
NIVUK	Numbers	14	42	Do not go up , because the Lord is not with you . You will be defeated by your enemies ,
NIVUK	Numbers	14	43	for the Amalekites and the Canaanites will face you there . Because you have turned away from the Lord , he will not be with you and you will fall by the sword. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	14	44	Nevertheless , in their presumption they went up towards the highest point in the hill country , though neither Moses nor the ark of the Lord ’ s covenant moved from the camp .
NIVUK	Numbers	14	45	Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and attacked them and beat them down all the way to Hormah . Footnotes - Numbers 14:25 Or the Sea of Reeds Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Numbers	16	16	Moses said to Korah , ‘ You and all your followers are to appear before the Lord tomorrow – you and they and Aaron .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	2	and rose up against Moses . With them were
NIVUK	Numbers	16	250	men who were offering the incense .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	3	They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron and said to them , ‘ You have gone too far ! The whole community is holy , every one of them , and the Lord is with them . Why then do you set yourselves above the Lord ’ s assembly ? ’
NIVUK	Numbers	16	4	When Moses heard this , he fell face down .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	5	Then he said to Korah and all his followers : ‘ In the morning the Lord will show who belongs to him and who is holy , and he will make that person come near him . The man he chooses he will cause to come near him .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	6	You , Korah , and all your followers are to do this : take censers
NIVUK	Numbers	16	7	and tomorrow put burning coals and incense in them before the Lord . The man the Lord chooses will be the one who is holy . You Levites have gone too far ! ’
NIVUK	Numbers	16	8	Moses also said to Korah , ‘ Now listen , you Levites !
NIVUK	Numbers	16	9	Isn ’ t it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near himself to do the work at the Lord ’ s tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them ?
NIVUK	Numbers	16	10	He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near himself , but now you are trying to get the priesthood too .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	11	It is against the Lord that you and all your followers have banded together . Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him ? ’
NIVUK	Numbers	16	12	Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab . But they said , ‘ We will not come !
NIVUK	Numbers	16	13	Isn ’ t it enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness ? And now you also want to lord it over us !
NIVUK	Numbers	16	14	Moreover , you haven ’ t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards . Do you want to treat these men like slaves [ b ] ? No , we will not come ! ’
NIVUK	Numbers	16	15	Then Moses became very angry and said to the Lord , ‘ Do not accept their offering . I have not taken so much as a donkey from them , nor have I wronged any of them. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	16	17	Each man is to take his censer and put incense in it –
NIVUK	Numbers	16	18	So each of them took his censer , put burning coals and incense in it , and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	19	When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them at the entrance to the tent of meeting , the glory of the Lord appeared to the entire assembly .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	20	The Lord said to Moses and Aaron ,
NIVUK	Numbers	16	21	‘ Separate yourselves from this assembly so that I can put an end to them at once. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	16	22	But Moses and Aaron fell face down and cried out , ‘ O God , the God who gives breath to all living things , will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins ? ’
NIVUK	Numbers	16	23	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
NIVUK	Numbers	16	24	‘ Say to the assembly , ‘ Move away from the tents of Korah , Dathan and Abiram. ” ’
NIVUK	Numbers	16	25	Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram , and the elders of Israel followed him .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	26	He warned the assembly , ‘ Move back from the tents of these wicked men ! Do not touch anything belonging to them , or you will be swept away because of all their sins. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	16	27	So they moved away from the tents of Korah , Dathan and Abiram . Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing with their wives , children and little ones at the entrances to their tents .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	28	Then Moses said , ‘ This is how you will know that the Lord has sent me to do all these things and that it was not my idea :
NIVUK	Numbers	16	29	if these men die a natural death and suffer the fate of all mankind , then the Lord has not sent me .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	30	But if the Lord brings about something totally new , and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them , with everything that belongs to them , and they go down alive into the realm of the dead , then you will know that these men have treated the Lord with contempt. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	16	31	As soon as he finished saying all this , the ground under them split apart
NIVUK	Numbers	16	32	and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households , and all those associated with Korah , together with their possessions .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	33	They went down alive into the realm of the dead , with everything they owned ; the earth closed over them , and they perished and were gone from the community .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	34	At their cries , all the Israelites around them fled , shouting , ‘ The earth is going to swallow us too ! ’
NIVUK	Numbers	16	35	And fire came out from the Lord and consumed the
NIVUK	Numbers	16	36	The Lord said to Moses ,
NIVUK	Numbers	16	37	‘ Tell Eleazar son of Aaron , the priest , to remove the censers from the charred remains and scatter the coals some distance away , for the censers are holy –
NIVUK	Numbers	16	38	the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives . Hammer the censers into sheets to overlay the altar , for they were presented before the Lord and have become holy . Let them be a sign to the Israelites. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	16	39	So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned to death , and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar ,
NIVUK	Numbers	16	40	as the Lord directed him through Moses . This was to remind the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before the Lord , or he would become like Korah and his followers .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	41	The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron . ‘ You have killed the Lord ’ s people , ’ they said .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	42	But when the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned towards the tent of meeting , suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the Lord appeared .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	43	Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting ,
NIVUK	Numbers	16	44	and the Lord said to Moses ,
NIVUK	Numbers	16	45	‘ Get away from this assembly so that I can put an end to them at once. ’ And they fell face down .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	46	Then Moses said to Aaron , ‘ Take your censer and put incense in it , along with burning coals from the altar , and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them . Wrath has come out from the Lord ; the plague has started. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	16	47	So Aaron did as Moses said , and ran into the midst of the assembly . The plague had already started among the people , but Aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	48	He stood between the living and the dead , and the plague stopped .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	49	But 14,700 people died from the plague , in addition to those who had died because of Korah .
NIVUK	Numbers	16	50	Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting , for the plague had stopped .

NIVUK	Numbers	17	17	[ a ] The Lord said to Moses ,
NIVUK	Numbers	17	2	‘ Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs from them , one from the leader of each of their ancestral tribes . Write the name of each man on his staff .
NIVUK	Numbers	17	3	On the staff of Levi write Aaron ’ s name , for there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral tribe .
NIVUK	Numbers	17	4	Place them in the tent of meeting in front of the ark of the covenant law , where I meet with you .
NIVUK	Numbers	17	5	The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout , and I will rid myself of this constant grumbling against you by the Israelites. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	17	6	So Moses spoke to the Israelites , and their leaders gave him twelve staffs , one for the leader of each of their ancestral tribes , and Aaron ’ s staff was among them .
NIVUK	Numbers	17	7	Moses placed the staffs before the Lord in the tent of the covenant law .
NIVUK	Numbers	17	8	The next day Moses entered the tent and saw that Aaron ’ s staff , which represented the tribe of Levi , had not only sprouted but had budded , blossomed and produced almonds .
NIVUK	Numbers	17	9	Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the Lord ’ s presence to all the Israelites . They looked at them , and each of the leaders took his own staff .
NIVUK	Numbers	17	10	The Lord said to Moses , ‘ Put back Aaron ’ s staff in front of the ark of the covenant law , to be kept as a sign to the rebellious . This will put an end to their grumbling against me , so that they will not die. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	17	11	Moses did just as the Lord commanded him .
NIVUK	Numbers	17	12	The Israelites said to Moses , ‘ We shall die ! We are lost , we are all lost !

NIVUK	Numbers	18	18	Their meat is to be yours , just as the breast of the wave offering and the right thigh are yours .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	2	Bring your fellow Levites from your ancestral tribe to join you and assist you when you and your sons minister before the tent of the covenant law .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	3	They are to be responsible to you and are to perform all the duties of the tent , but they must not go near the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar . Otherwise both they and you will die .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	4	They are to join you and be responsible for the care of the tent of meeting – all the work at the tent – and no one else may come near where you are .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	5	‘ You are to be responsible for the care of the sanctuary and the altar , so that my wrath will not fall on the Israelites again .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	6	I myself have selected your fellow Levites from among the Israelites as a gift to you , dedicated to the Lord to do the work at the tent of meeting .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	7	But only you and your sons may serve as priests in connection with everything at the altar and inside the curtain . I am giving you the service of the priesthood as a gift . Anyone else who comes near the sanctuary is to be put to death. ’ Offerings for priests and Levites
NIVUK	Numbers	18	8	Then the Lord said to Aaron , ‘ I myself have put you in charge of the offerings presented to me ; all the holy offerings the Israelites give me I give to you and your sons as your portion , your perpetual share .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	9	You are to have the part of the most holy offerings that is kept from the fire . From all the gifts they bring me as most holy offerings , whether grain or sin [ a ] or guilt offerings , that part belongs to you and your sons .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	10	Eat it as something most holy ; every male shall eat it . You must regard it as holy .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	11	‘ This also is yours : whatever is set aside from the gifts of all the wave offerings of the Israelites . I give this to you and your sons and daughters as your perpetual share . Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	12	‘ I give you all the finest olive oil and all the finest new wine and grain they give to the Lord as the firstfruits of their harvest .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	13	All the land ’ s firstfruits that they bring to the Lord will be yours . Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	14	‘ Everything in Israel that is devoted [ b ] to the Lord is yours .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	15	The first offspring of every womb , both human and animal , that is offered to the Lord is yours . But you must redeem every firstborn son and every firstborn male of unclean animals .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	16	When they are a month old , you must redeem them at the redemption price set at five shekels [ c ] of silver , according to the sanctuary shekel , which weighs twenty gerahs .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	17	‘ But you must not redeem the firstborn of an ox , a sheep or a goat ; they are holy . Splash their blood against the altar and burn their fat as a food offering , an aroma pleasing to the Lord .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	19	Whatever is set aside from the holy offerings the Israelites present to the Lord I give to you and your sons and daughters as your perpetual share . It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the Lord for both you and your offspring. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	18	20	The Lord said to Aaron , ‘ You will have no inheritance in their land , nor will you have any share among them ; I am your share and your inheritance among the Israelites .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	21	‘ I give to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in return for the work they do while serving at the tent of meeting .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	22	From now on the Israelites must not go near the tent of meeting , or they will bear the consequences of their sin and will die .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	23	It is the Levites who are to do the work at the tent of meeting and bear the responsibility for any offences they commit against it . This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come . They will receive no inheritance among the Israelites .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	24	Instead , I give to the Levites as their inheritance the tithes that the Israelites present as an offering to the Lord . That is why I said concerning them : “ They will have no inheritance among the Israelites. ” ’
NIVUK	Numbers	18	25	The Lord said to Moses ,
NIVUK	Numbers	18	26	‘ Speak to the Levites and say to them : “ When you receive from the Israelites the tithe I give you as your inheritance , you must present a tenth of that tithe as the Lord ’ s offering .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	27	Your offering will be reckoned to you as grain from the threshing-floor or juice from the winepress .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	28	In this way you also will present an offering to the Lord from all the tithes you receive from the Israelites . From these tithes you must give the Lord ’ s portion to Aaron the priest .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	29	You must present as the Lord ’ s portion the best and holiest part of everything given to you. ”
NIVUK	Numbers	18	30	‘ Say to the Levites : “ When you present the best part , it will be reckoned to you as the product of the threshing-floor or the winepress .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	31	You and your households may eat the rest of it anywhere , for it is your wages for your work at the tent of meeting .
NIVUK	Numbers	18	32	By presenting the best part of it you will not be guilty in this matter ; then you will not defile the holy offerings of the Israelites , and you will not die. ” ’ Footnotes - Numbers 18:9 Or purification - Numbers 18:14 The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the Lord . - Numbers 18:16 That is , about

NIVUK	Numbers	19	19	The man who is clean is to sprinkle those who are unclean on the third and seventh days , and on the seventh day he is to purify them . Those who are being cleansed must wash their clothes and bathe with water , and that evening they will be clean .
NIVUK	Numbers	19	2	‘ This is a requirement of the law that the Lord has commanded : tell the Israelites to bring you a red heifer without defect or blemish and that has never been under a yoke .
NIVUK	Numbers	19	3	Give it to Eleazar the priest ; it is to be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence .
NIVUK	Numbers	19	4	Then Eleazar the priest is to take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times towards the front of the tent of meeting .
NIVUK	Numbers	19	5	While he watches , the heifer is to be burned – its hide , flesh , blood and intestines .
NIVUK	Numbers	19	6	The priest is to take some cedar wood , hyssop and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer .
NIVUK	Numbers	19	7	After that , the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water . He may then come into the camp , but he will be ceremonially unclean till evening .
NIVUK	Numbers	19	8	The man who burns it must also wash his clothes and bathe with water , and he too will be unclean till evening .
NIVUK	Numbers	19	9	‘ A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and put them in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp . They are to be kept by the Israelite community for use in the water of cleansing ; it is for purification from sin .
NIVUK	Numbers	19	10	The man who gathers up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes , and he too will be unclean till evening . This will be a lasting ordinance both for the Israelites and for the foreigners residing among them .
NIVUK	Numbers	19	11	‘ Whoever touches a human corpse will be unclean for seven days .
NIVUK	Numbers	19	12	They must purify themselves with the water on the third day and on the seventh day ; then they will be clean . But if they do not purify themselves on the third and seventh days , they will not be clean .
NIVUK	Numbers	19	13	If they fail to purify themselves after touching a human corpse , they defile the Lord ’ s tabernacle . They must be cut off from Israel . Because the water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on them , they are unclean ; their uncleanness remains on them .
NIVUK	Numbers	19	14	‘ This is the law that applies when a person dies in a tent : anyone who enters the tent and anyone who is in it will be unclean for seven days ,
NIVUK	Numbers	19	15	and every open container without a lid fastened on it will be unclean .
NIVUK	Numbers	19	16	‘ Anyone out in the open who touches someone who has been killed with a sword or someone who has died a natural death , or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave , will be unclean for seven days .
NIVUK	Numbers	19	17	‘ For the unclean person , put some ashes from the burned purification offering into a jar and pour fresh water over them .
NIVUK	Numbers	19	18	Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to take some hyssop , dip it in the water and sprinkle the tent and all the furnishings and the people who were there . He must also sprinkle anyone who has touched a human bone or a grave or anyone who has been killed or anyone who has died a natural death .
NIVUK	Numbers	19	20	But if those who are unclean do not purify themselves , they must be cut off from the community , because they have defiled the sanctuary of the Lord . The water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on them , and they are unclean .

NIVUK	Numbers	20	20	Again they answered : ‘ You may not pass through. ’ Then Edom came out against them with a large and powerful army .
NIVUK	Numbers	20	2	Now there was no water for the community , and the people gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron .
NIVUK	Numbers	20	3	They quarrelled with Moses and said , ‘ If only we had died when our brothers fell dead before the Lord !
NIVUK	Numbers	20	4	Why did you bring the Lord ’ s community into this wilderness , that we and our livestock should die here ?
NIVUK	Numbers	20	5	Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to this terrible place ? It has no corn or figs , grapevines or pomegranates . And there is no water to drink ! ’
NIVUK	Numbers	20	6	Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance to the tent of meeting and fell face down , and the glory of the Lord appeared to them .
NIVUK	Numbers	20	7	The Lord said to Moses ,
NIVUK	Numbers	20	8	‘ Take the staff , and you and your brother Aaron gather the assembly together . Speak to that rock before their eyes and it will pour out its water . You will bring water out of the rock for the community so that they and their livestock can drink. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	20	9	So Moses took the staff from the Lord ’ s presence , just as he commanded him .
NIVUK	Numbers	20	10	He and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock and Moses said to them , ‘ Listen , you rebels , must we bring you water out of this rock ? ’
NIVUK	Numbers	20	11	Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff . Water gushed out , and the community and their livestock drank .
NIVUK	Numbers	20	12	But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron , ‘ Because you did not trust in me enough to honour me as holy in the sight of the Israelites , you will not bring this community into the land I give them. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	20	13	These were the waters of Meribah , [ a ] where the Israelites quarrelled with the Lord and where he was proved holy among them . Edom denies Israel passage
NIVUK	Numbers	20	14	Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom , saying : ‘ This is what your brother Israel says : you know about all the hardships that have come on us .
NIVUK	Numbers	20	15	Our ancestors went down into Egypt , and we lived there many years . The Egyptians ill-treated us and our ancestors ,
NIVUK	Numbers	20	16	but when we cried out to the Lord , he heard our cry and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt . ‘ Now we are here at Kadesh , a town on the edge of your territory .
NIVUK	Numbers	20	17	Please let us pass through your country . We will not go through any field or vineyard , or drink water from any well . We will travel along the King ’ s Highway and not turn to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	20	18	But Edom answered : ‘ You may not pass through here ; if you try , we will march out and attack you with the sword. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	20	19	The Israelites replied : ‘ We will go along the main road , and if we or our livestock drink any of your water , we will pay for it . We only want to pass through on foot – nothing else. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	20	21	Since Edom refused to let them go through their territory , Israel turned away from them . The death of Aaron
NIVUK	Numbers	20	22	The whole Israelite community set out from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor .
NIVUK	Numbers	20	23	At Mount Hor , near the border of Edom , the Lord said to Moses and Aaron ,
NIVUK	Numbers	20	24	‘ Aaron will be gathered to his people . He will not enter the land I give the Israelites , because both of you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah .
NIVUK	Numbers	20	25	Call Aaron and his son Eleazar and take them up Mount Hor .
NIVUK	Numbers	20	26	Remove Aaron ’ s garments and put them on his son Eleazar , for Aaron will be gathered to his people ; he will die there. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	20	27	Moses did as the Lord commanded : they went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community .
NIVUK	Numbers	20	28	Moses removed Aaron ’ s garments and put them on his son Eleazar . And Aaron died there on top of the mountain . Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain ,

NIVUK	Numbers	21	21	Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites :
NIVUK	Numbers	21	2	Then Israel made this vow to the Lord : ‘ If you will deliver these people into our hands , we will totally destroy [ a ] their cities. ’

NIVUK	Numbers	21	5	they spoke against God and against Moses , and said , ‘ Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness ? There is no bread ! There is no water ! And we detest this miserable food ! ’
NIVUK	Numbers	21	6	Then the Lord sent venomous snakes among them ; they bit the people and many Israelites died .
NIVUK	Numbers	21	7	The people came to Moses and said , ‘ We sinned when we spoke against the Lord and against you . Pray that the Lord will take the snakes away from us. ’ So Moses prayed for the people .
NIVUK	Numbers	21	8	The Lord said to Moses , ‘ Make a snake and put it up on a pole ; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live. ’

NIVUK	Numbers	21	10	The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth .
NIVUK	Numbers	21	11	Then they set out from Oboth and camped in Iye Abarim , in the wilderness that faces Moab towards the sunrise .

NIVUK	Numbers	21	17	Then Israel sang this song : ‘ Spring up , O well ! Sing about it ,
NIVUK	Numbers	21	18	about the well that the princes dug , that the nobles of the people sank – the nobles with sceptres and staffs. ’ Then they went from the wilderness to Mattanah ,

NIVUK	Numbers	21	23	But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory . He mustered his entire army and marched out into the wilderness against Israel . When he reached Jahaz , he fought with Israel .
NIVUK	Numbers	21	24	Israel , however , put him to the sword and took over his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok , but only as far as the Ammonites , because their border was fortified .
NIVUK	Numbers	21	25	Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them , including Heshbon and all its surrounding settlements .
NIVUK	Numbers	21	26	Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites , who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken from him all his land as far as the Arnon .
NIVUK	Numbers	21	27	That is why the poets say : ‘ Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt ; let Sihon ’ s city be restored .
NIVUK	Numbers	21	28	‘ Fire went out from Heshbon , a blaze from the city of Sihon . It consumed Ar of Moab , the citizens of Arnon ’ s heights .
NIVUK	Numbers	21	29	Woe to you , Moab ! You are destroyed , people of Chemosh ! He has given up his sons as fugitives and his daughters as captives to Sihon king of the Amorites .
NIVUK	Numbers	21	30	‘ But we have overthrown them ; Heshbon ’ s dominion has been destroyed all the way to Dibon . We have demolished them as far as Nophah , which extends to Medeba. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	21	31	So Israel settled in the land of the Amorites .

NIVUK	Numbers	22	22	But God was very angry when he went , and the angel of the Lord stood in the road to oppose him . Balaam was riding on his donkey , and his two servants were with him .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	2	Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites ,
NIVUK	Numbers	22	3	and Moab was terrified because there were so many people . Indeed , Moab was filled with dread because of the Israelites .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	4	The Moabites said to the elders of Midian , ‘ This horde is going to lick up everything around us , as an ox licks up the grass of the field. ’ So Balak son of Zippor , who was king of Moab at that time ,
NIVUK	Numbers	22	5	sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor , who was at Pethor , near the River Euphrates , in his native land . Balak said : ‘ A people has come out of Egypt ; they cover the face of the land and have settled next to me .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	6	Now come and put a curse on these people , because they are too powerful for me . Perhaps then I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land . For I know that whoever you bless is blessed , and whoever you curse is cursed. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	22	7	The elders of Moab and Midian left , taking with them the fee for divination . When they came to Balaam , they told him what Balak had said .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	8	‘ Spend the night here , ’ Balaam said to them , ‘ and I will report back to you with the answer the Lord gives me. ’ So the Moabite officials stayed with him .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	9	God came to Balaam and asked , ‘ Who are these men with you ? ’
NIVUK	Numbers	22	10	Balaam said to God , ‘ Balak son of Zippor , king of Moab , sent me this message :
NIVUK	Numbers	22	11	“ A people that has come out of Egypt covers the face of the land . Now come and put a curse on them for me . Perhaps then I will be able to fight them and drive them away. ” ’
NIVUK	Numbers	22	12	But God said to Balaam , ‘ Do not go with them . You must not put a curse on those people , because they are blessed. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	22	13	The next morning Balaam got up and said to Balak ’ s officials , ‘ Go back to your own country , for the Lord has refused to let me go with you. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	22	14	So the Moabite officials returned to Balak and said , ‘ Balaam refused to come with us. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	22	15	Then Balak sent other officials , more numerous and more distinguished than the first .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	16	They came to Balaam and said : ‘ This is what Balak son of Zippor says : do not let anything keep you from coming to me ,
NIVUK	Numbers	22	17	because I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say . Come and put a curse on these people for me. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	22	18	But Balaam answered them , ‘ Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace , I could not do anything great or small to go beyond the command of the Lord my God .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	19	Now spend the night here so that I can find out what else the Lord will tell me. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	22	20	That night God came to Balaam and said , ‘ Since these men have come to summon you , go with them , but do only what I tell you. ’ Balaam ’ s donkey
NIVUK	Numbers	22	21	Balaam got up in the morning , saddled his donkey and went with the Moabite officials .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	23	When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand , it turned off the road into a field . Balaam beat it to get it back on the road .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	24	Then the angel of the Lord stood in a narrow path through the vineyards , with walls on both sides .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	25	When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord , it pressed close to the wall , crushing Balaam ’ s foot against it . So he beat the donkey again .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	26	Then the angel of the Lord moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn , either to the right or to the left .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	27	When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord , it lay down under Balaam , and he was angry and beat it with his staff .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	28	Then the Lord opened the donkey ’ s mouth , and it said to Balaam , ‘ What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times ? ’
NIVUK	Numbers	22	29	Balaam answered the donkey , ‘ You have made a fool of me ! If only I had a sword in my hand , I would kill you here and now. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	22	30	The donkey said to Balaam , ‘ Am I not your own donkey , which you have always ridden , to this day ? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you ? ’ ‘ No , ’ he said .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	31	Then the Lord opened Balaam ’ s eyes , and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with his sword drawn . So he bowed low and fell face down .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	32	The angel of the Lord asked him , ‘ Why have you beaten your donkey these three times ? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one before me . [ a ]
NIVUK	Numbers	22	33	The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times . If it had not turned away , I would certainly have killed you by now , but I would have spared it. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	22	34	Balaam said to the angel of the Lord , ‘ I have sinned . I did not realise you were standing in the road to oppose me . Now if you are displeased , I will go back. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	22	35	The angel of the Lord said to Balaam , ‘ Go with the men , but speak only what I tell you. ’ So Balaam went with Balak ’ s officials .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	36	When Balak heard that Balaam was coming , he went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border , at the edge of his territory .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	37	Balak said to Balaam , ‘ Did I not send you an urgent summons ? Why didn ’ t you come to me ? Am I really not able to reward you ? ’
NIVUK	Numbers	22	38	‘ Well , I have come to you now , ’ Balaam replied . ‘ But I can ’ t say whatever I please . I must speak only what God puts in my mouth. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	22	39	Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	40	Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep , and gave some to Balaam and the officials who were with him .
NIVUK	Numbers	22	41	The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal , and from there he could see the outskirts of the Israelite camp . Footnotes - Numbers 22:32 The meaning of the Hebrew for this clause is uncertain . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Numbers	23	23	There is no divination against [ b ] Jacob , no evil omens against [ c ] Israel . It will now be said of Jacob and of Israel , “ See what God has done ! ”
NIVUK	Numbers	23	2	Balak did as Balaam said , and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar .
NIVUK	Numbers	23	3	Then Balaam said to Balak , ‘ Stay here beside your offering while I go aside . Perhaps the Lord will come to meet with me . Whatever he reveals to me I will tell you. ’ Then he went off to a barren height .
NIVUK	Numbers	23	4	God met with him , and Balaam said , ‘ I have prepared seven altars , and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	23	5	The Lord put a word in Balaam ’ s mouth and said , ‘ Go back to Balak and give him this word. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	23	6	So he went back to him and found him standing beside his offering , with all the Moabite officials .
NIVUK	Numbers	23	7	Then Balaam spoke his message : ‘ Balak brought me from Aram , the king of Moab from the eastern mountains . “ Come , ” he said , “ curse Jacob for me ; come , denounce Israel. ”
NIVUK	Numbers	23	8	How can I curse those whom God has not cursed ? How can I denounce those whom the Lord has not denounced ?
NIVUK	Numbers	23	9	From the rocky peaks I see them , from the heights I view them . I see people who live apart and do not consider themselves one of the nations .
NIVUK	Numbers	23	10	Who can count the dust of Jacob or number even a fourth of Israel ? Let me die the death of the righteous , and may my final end be like theirs ! ’
NIVUK	Numbers	23	11	Balak said to Balaam , ‘ What have you done to me ? I brought you to curse my enemies , but you have done nothing but bless them ! ’
NIVUK	Numbers	23	12	He answered , ‘ Must I not speak what the Lord puts in my mouth ? ’ Balaam ’ s second message
NIVUK	Numbers	23	13	Then Balak said to him , ‘ Come with me to another place where you can see them ; you will not see them all but only the outskirts of their camp . And from there , curse them for me. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	23	14	So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah , and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar .
NIVUK	Numbers	23	15	Balaam said to Balak , ‘ Stay here beside your offering while I meet with him over there. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	23	16	The Lord met with Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said , ‘ Go back to Balak and give him this word. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	23	17	So he went to him and found him standing beside his offering , with the Moabite officials . Balak asked him , ‘ What did the Lord say ? ’
NIVUK	Numbers	23	18	Then he spoke his message : ‘ Arise , Balak , and listen ; hear me , son of Zippor .
NIVUK	Numbers	23	19	God is not human , that he should lie , not a human being , that he should change his mind . Does he speak and then not act ? Does he promise and not fulfil ?
NIVUK	Numbers	23	20	I have received a command to bless ; he has blessed , and I can not change it .
NIVUK	Numbers	23	21	‘ No misfortune is seen in Jacob , no misery observed [ a ] in Israel . The Lord their God is with them ; the shout of the King is among them .

NIVUK	Numbers	23	24	The people rise like a lioness ; they rouse themselves like a lion that does not rest till it devours its prey and drinks the blood of its victims. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	23	25	Then Balak said to Balaam , ‘ Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all ! ’
NIVUK	Numbers	23	26	Balaam answered , ‘ Did I not tell you I must do whatever the Lord says ? ’ Balaam ’ s third message
NIVUK	Numbers	23	27	Then Balak said to Balaam , ‘ Come , let me take you to another place . Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	23	28	And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor , overlooking the wasteland .
NIVUK	Numbers	23	29	Balaam said , ‘ Build me seven altars here , and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me. ’

NIVUK	Numbers	24	10	Then Balak ’ s anger burned against Balaam . He struck his hands together and said to him , ‘ I summoned you to curse my enemies , but you have blessed them these three times .
NIVUK	Numbers	24	11	Now leave at once and go home ! I said I would reward you handsomely , but the Lord has kept you from being rewarded. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	24	12	Balaam answered Balak , ‘ Did I not tell the messengers you sent me ,

NIVUK	Numbers	25	25	While Israel was staying in Shittim , the men began to indulge in sexual immorality with Moabite women ,
NIVUK	Numbers	25	2	who invited them to the sacrifices to their gods . The people ate the sacrificial meal and bowed down before these gods .
NIVUK	Numbers	25	3	So Israel yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor . And the Lord ’ s anger burned against them .

NIVUK	Numbers	25	9	but those who died in the plague numbered 24,000 .
NIVUK	Numbers	25	10	The Lord said to Moses ,
NIVUK	Numbers	25	11	‘ Phinehas son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron , the priest , has turned my anger away from the Israelites . Since he was as zealous for my honour among them as I am , I did not put an end to them in my zeal .

NIVUK	Numbers	27	27	The daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Makir , the son of Manasseh , belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph . The names of the daughters were Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milkah and Tirzah . They came forward
NIVUK	Numbers	27	2	and stood before Moses , Eleazar the priest , the leaders and the whole assembly at the entrance to the tent of meeting and said ,
NIVUK	Numbers	27	3	‘ Our father died in the wilderness . He was not among Korah ’ s followers , who banded together against the Lord , but he died for his own sin and left no sons .
NIVUK	Numbers	27	4	Why should our father ’ s name disappear from his clan because he had no son ? Give us property among our father ’ s relatives. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	27	5	So Moses brought their case before the Lord ,
NIVUK	Numbers	27	6	and the Lord said to him ,
NIVUK	Numbers	27	7	‘ What Zelophehad ’ s daughters are saying is right . You must certainly give them property as an inheritance among their father ’ s relatives and give their father ’ s inheritance to them .
NIVUK	Numbers	27	8	‘ Say to the Israelites , “ If a man dies and leaves no son , give his inheritance to his daughter .
NIVUK	Numbers	27	9	If he has no daughter , give his inheritance to his brothers .
NIVUK	Numbers	27	10	If he has no brothers , give his inheritance to his father ’ s brothers .

NIVUK	Numbers	27	12	Then the Lord said to Moses , ‘ Go up this mountain in the Abarim Range and see the land I have given the Israelites .
NIVUK	Numbers	27	13	After you have seen it , you too will be gathered to your people , as your brother Aaron was ,
NIVUK	Numbers	27	14	for when the community rebelled at the waters in the Desert of Zin , both of you disobeyed my command to honour me as holy before their eyes. ’ ( These were the waters of Meribah Kadesh , in the Desert of Zin . )
NIVUK	Numbers	27	15	Moses said to the Lord ,
NIVUK	Numbers	27	16	‘ May the Lord , the God who gives breath to all living things , appoint someone over this community
NIVUK	Numbers	27	17	to go out and come in before them , one who will lead them out and bring them in , so that the Lord ’ s people will not be like sheep without a shepherd. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	27	18	So the Lord said to Moses , ‘ Take Joshua son of Nun , a man in whom is the spirit of leadership , [ a ] and lay your hand on him .
NIVUK	Numbers	27	19	Make him stand before Eleazar the priest and the entire assembly and commission him in their presence .
NIVUK	Numbers	27	20	Give him some of your authority so that the whole Israelite community will obey him .
NIVUK	Numbers	27	21	He is to stand before Eleazar the priest , who will obtain decisions for him by enquiring of the Urim before the Lord . At his command he and the entire community of the Israelites will go out , and at his command they will come in. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	27	22	Moses did as the Lord commanded him . He took Joshua and made him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole assembly .

NIVUK	Numbers	32	32	We will cross over before the Lord into Canaan armed , but the property we inherit will be on this side of the Jordan. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	32	2	So they came to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community , and said ,
NIVUK	Numbers	32	3	‘ Ataroth , Dibon , Jazer , Nimrah , Heshbon , Elealeh , Sebam , Nebo and Beon –

NIVUK	Numbers	32	5	If we have found favour in your eyes , ’ they said , ‘ let this land be given to your servants as our possession . Do not make us cross the Jordan. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	32	6	Moses said to the Gadites and Reubenites , ‘ Should your fellow Israelites go to war while you sit here ?
NIVUK	Numbers	32	7	Why do you discourage the Israelites from crossing over into the land the Lord has given them ?
NIVUK	Numbers	32	8	This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look over the land .
NIVUK	Numbers	32	9	After they went up to the Valley of Eshkol and viewed the land , they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land the Lord had given them .
NIVUK	Numbers	32	10	The Lord ’ s anger was aroused that day and he swore this oath :
NIVUK	Numbers	32	11	“ Because they have not followed me wholeheartedly , not one of those who were twenty years old or more when they came up out of Egypt will see the land I promised on oath to Abraham , Isaac and Jacob –
NIVUK	Numbers	32	12	not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun , for they followed the Lord wholeheartedly. ”
NIVUK	Numbers	32	13	The Lord ’ s anger burned against Israel and he made them wander in the wilderness for forty years , until the whole generation of those who had done evil in his sight was gone .
NIVUK	Numbers	32	14	‘ And here you are , a brood of sinners , standing in the place of your fathers and making the Lord even more angry with Israel .
NIVUK	Numbers	32	15	If you turn away from following him , he will again leave all this people in the wilderness , and you will be the cause of their destruction. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	32	16	Then they came up to him and said , ‘ We would like to build pens here for our livestock and cities for our women and children .
NIVUK	Numbers	32	17	But we will arm ourselves for battle [ a ] and go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them to their place . Meanwhile our women and children will live in fortified cities , for protection from the inhabitants of the land .
NIVUK	Numbers	32	18	We will not return to our homes until each of the Israelites has received their inheritance .
NIVUK	Numbers	32	19	We will not receive any inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan , because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	32	20	Then Moses said to them , ‘ If you will do this – if you will arm yourselves before the Lord for battle
NIVUK	Numbers	32	21	and if all of you who are armed cross over the Jordan before the Lord until he has driven his enemies out before him –
NIVUK	Numbers	32	22	then when the land is subdued before the Lord , you may return and be free from your obligation to the Lord and to Israel . And this land will be your possession before the Lord .
NIVUK	Numbers	32	23	‘ But if you fail to do this , you will be sinning against the Lord ; and you may be sure that your sin will find you out .
NIVUK	Numbers	32	24	Build cities for your women and children , and pens for your flocks , but do what you have promised. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	32	25	The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses , ‘ We your servants will do as our lord commands .

NIVUK	Numbers	32	27	But your servants , every man who is armed for battle , will cross over to fight before the Lord , just as our lord says. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	32	28	Then Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and to the family heads of the Israelite tribes .
NIVUK	Numbers	32	29	He said to them , ‘ If the Gadites and Reubenites , every man armed for battle , cross over the Jordan with you before the Lord , then when the land is subdued before you , you must give them the land of Gilead as their possession .
NIVUK	Numbers	32	30	But if they do not cross over with you armed , they must accept their possession with you in Canaan. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	32	31	The Gadites and Reubenites answered , ‘ Your servants will do what the Lord has said .

NIVUK	Numbers	34	12	Then the boundary will go down along the Jordan and end at the Dead Sea . ‘ “ This will be your land , with its boundaries on every side. ” ’
NIVUK	Numbers	34	13	Moses commanded the Israelites : ‘ Assign this land by lot as an inheritance . The Lord has ordered that it be given to the nine-and-a-half tribes ,
NIVUK	Numbers	34	14	because the families of the tribe of Reuben , the tribe of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance .

NIVUK	Numbers	35	35	On the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho , the Lord said to Moses ,
NIVUK	Numbers	35	2	‘ Command the Israelites to give the Levites towns to live in from the inheritance the Israelites will possess . And give them pasture-lands around the towns .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	3	Then they will have towns to live in and pasture-lands for the cattle they own and all their other animals .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	4	‘ The pasture-lands around the towns that you give the Levites will extend a thousand cubits [ a ] from the town wall .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	5	Outside the town , measure two thousand cubits [ b ] on the east side , two thousand on the south side , two thousand on the west and two thousand on the north , with the town in the centre . They will have this area as pasture-land for the towns . Cities of refuge
NIVUK	Numbers	35	6	‘ Six of the towns you give the Levites will be cities of refuge , to which a person who has killed someone may flee . In addition , give them forty-two other towns .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	7	In all you must give the Levites forty-eight towns , together with their pasture-lands .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	8	The towns you give the Levites from the land the Israelites possess are to be given in proportion to the inheritance of each tribe : take many towns from a tribe that has many , but few from one that has few. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	35	9	Then the Lord said to Moses :
NIVUK	Numbers	35	10	‘ Speak to the Israelites and say to them : “ When you cross the Jordan into Canaan ,
NIVUK	Numbers	35	11	select some towns to be your cities of refuge , to which a person who has killed someone accidentally may flee .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	12	They will be places of refuge from the avenger , so that anyone accused of murder may not die before they stand trial before the assembly .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	13	These six towns you give will be your cities of refuge .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	14	Give three on this side of the Jordan and three in Canaan as cities of refuge .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	15	These six towns will be a place of refuge for Israelites and for foreigners residing among them , so that anyone who has killed another accidentally can flee there .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	16	‘ “ If anyone strikes someone a fatal blow with an iron object , that person is a murderer ; the murderer is to be put to death .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	17	Or if anyone is holding a stone and strikes someone a fatal blow with it , that person is a murderer ; the murderer is to be put to death .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	18	Or if anyone is holding a wooden object and strikes someone a fatal blow with it , that person is a murderer ; the murderer is to be put to death .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	19	The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death ; when the avenger comes upon the murderer , the avenger shall put the murderer to death .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	20	If anyone with malice aforethought pushes another or throws something at them intentionally so that they die
NIVUK	Numbers	35	21	or if out of enmity one person hits another with their fist so that the other dies , that person is to be put to death ; that person is a murderer . The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when they meet .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	22	‘ “ But if without enmity someone suddenly pushes another or throws something at them unintentionally
NIVUK	Numbers	35	23	or , without seeing them , drops on them a stone heavy enough to kill them , and they die , then since that other person was not an enemy and no harm was intended ,
NIVUK	Numbers	35	24	the assembly must judge between the accused and the avenger of blood according to these regulations .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	25	The assembly must protect the one accused of murder from the avenger of blood and send the accused back to the city of refuge to which they fled . The accused must stay there until the death of the high priest , who was anointed with holy oil .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	26	‘ “ But if the accused ever goes outside the limits of the city of refuge to which they fled
NIVUK	Numbers	35	27	and the avenger of blood finds them outside the city , the avenger of blood may kill the accused without being guilty of murder .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	28	The accused must stay in the city of refuge until the death of the high priest ; only after the death of the high priest may they return to their own property .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	29	‘ “ This is to have the force of law for you throughout the generations to come , wherever you live .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	30	‘ “ Anyone who kills a person is to be put to death as a murderer only on the testimony of witnesses . But no one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	31	‘ “ Do not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer , who deserves to die . They are to be put to death .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	32	‘ “ Do not accept a ransom for anyone who has fled to a city of refuge and so allow them to go back and live on their own land before the death of the high priest .
NIVUK	Numbers	35	33	‘ “ Do not pollute the land where you are . Bloodshed pollutes the land , and atonement can not be made for the land on which blood has been shed , except by the blood of the one who shed it .

NIVUK	Numbers	36	36	The family heads of the clan of Gilead son of Makir , the son of Manasseh , who were from the clans of the descendants of Joseph , came and spoke before Moses and the leaders , the heads of the Israelite families .
NIVUK	Numbers	36	2	They said , ‘ When the Lord commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot , he ordered you to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters .
NIVUK	Numbers	36	3	Now suppose they marry men from other Israelite tribes ; then their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry into . And so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken away .
NIVUK	Numbers	36	4	When the Year of Jubilee for the Israelites comes , their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry , and their property will be taken from the tribal inheritance of our ancestors. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	36	5	Then at the Lord ’ s command Moses gave this order to the Israelites : ‘ What the tribe of the descendants of Joseph is saying is right .
NIVUK	Numbers	36	6	This is what the Lord commands for Zelophehad ’ s daughters : they may marry anyone they please as long as they marry within their father ’ s tribal clan .
NIVUK	Numbers	36	7	No inheritance in Israel is to pass from one tribe to another , for every Israelite shall keep the tribal inheritance of their ancestors .

NIVUK	Numbers	36	9	No inheritance may pass from one tribe to another , for each Israelite tribe is to keep the land it inherits. ’
NIVUK	Numbers	36	10	So Zelophehad ’ s daughters did as the Lord commanded Moses .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	1	These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel in the wilderness east of the Jordan – that is , in the Arabah – opposite Suph , between Paran and Tophel , Laban , Hazeroth and Dizahab .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	2	( It takes eleven days to go from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir road . )
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	3	In the fortieth year , on the first day of the eleventh month , Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the Lord had commanded him concerning them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	4	This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites , who reigned in Heshbon , and at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan , who reigned in Ashtaroth .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	5	East of the Jordan in the territory of Moab , Moses began to expound this law , saying :
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	6	The Lord our God said to us at Horeb , ‘ You have stayed long enough at this mountain .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	7	Break camp and advance into the hill country of the Amorites ; go to all the neighbouring peoples in the Arabah , in the mountains , in the western foothills , in the Negev and along the coast , to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon , as far as the great river , the Euphrates .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	8	See , I have given you this land . Go in and take possession of the land that the Lord swore he would give to your fathers – to Abraham , Isaac and Jacob – and to their descendants after them. ’ The appointment of leaders
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	9	At that time I said to you , ‘ You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	10	The Lord your God has increased your numbers so that today you are as numerous as the stars in the sky .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	11	May the Lord , the God of your ancestors , increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised !
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	12	But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself ?
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	13	Choose some wise , understanding and respected men from each of your tribes , and I will set them over you. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	14	You answered me , ‘ What you propose to do is good. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	15	So I took the leading men of your tribes , wise and respected men , and appointed them to have authority over you – as commanders of thousands , of hundreds , of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	16	And I charged your judges at that time , ‘ Hear the disputes between your people and judge fairly , whether the case is between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner residing among you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	17	Do not show partiality in judging ; hear both small and great alike . Do not be afraid of anyone , for judgment belongs to God . Bring me any case too hard for you , and I will hear it. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	18	And at that time I told you everything you were to do . Spies sent out
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	19	Then , as the Lord our God commanded us , we set out from Horeb and went towards the hill country of the Amorites through all that vast and dreadful wilderness that you have seen , and so we reached Kadesh Barnea .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	20	Then I said to you , ‘ You have reached the hill country of the Amorites , which the Lord our God is giving us .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	21	See , the Lord your God has given you the land . Go up and take possession of it as the Lord , the God of your ancestors , told you . Do not be afraid ; do not be discouraged. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	22	Then all of you came to me and said , ‘ Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	23	The idea seemed good to me ; so I selected twelve of you , one man from each tribe .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	24	They left and went up into the hill country , and came to the Valley of Eshkol and explored it .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	25	Taking with them some of the fruit of the land , they brought it down to us and reported , ‘ It is a good land that the Lord our God is giving us. ’ Rebellion against the Lord
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	26	But you were unwilling to go up ; you rebelled against the command of the Lord your God .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	27	You grumbled in your tents and said , ‘ The Lord hates us ; so he brought us out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	28	Where can we go ? Our brothers have made our hearts melt in fear . They say , “ The people are stronger and taller than we are ; the cities are large , with walls up to the sky . We even saw the Anakites there. ” ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	29	Then I said to you , ‘ Do not be terrified ; do not be afraid of them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	30	The Lord your God , who is going before you , will fight for you , as he did for you in Egypt , before your very eyes ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	31	and in the wilderness . There you saw how the Lord your God carried you , as a father carries his son , all the way you went until you reached this place. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	32	In spite of this , you did not trust in the Lord your God ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	33	who went ahead of you on your journey , in fire by night and in a cloud by day , to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	34	When the Lord heard what you said , he was angry and solemnly swore :
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	35	‘ No one from this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your ancestors ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	36	except Caleb son of Jephunneh . He will see it , and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on , because he followed the Lord wholeheartedly. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	37	Because of you the Lord became angry with me also and said , ‘ You shall not enter it , either .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	38	But your assistant , Joshua son of Nun , will enter it . Encourage him , because he will lead Israel to inherit it .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	39	And the little ones that you said would be taken captive , your children who do not yet know good from bad – they will enter the land . I will give it to them and they will take possession of it .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	40	But as for you , turn round and set out towards the desert along the route to the Red Sea. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	41	Then you replied , ‘ We have sinned against the Lord . We will go up and fight , as the Lord our God commanded us. ’ So every one of you put on his weapons , thinking it easy to go up into the hill country .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	42	But the Lord said to me , ‘ Tell them , “ Do not go up and fight , because I will not be with you . You will be defeated by your enemies. ” ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	43	So I told you , but you would not listen . You rebelled against the Lord ’ s command and in your arrogance you marched up into the hill country .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	44	The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you ; they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	45	You came back and wept before the Lord , but he paid no attention to your weeping and turned a deaf ear to you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	1	46	And so you stayed in Kadesh many days – all the time you spent there . Footnotes - Deuteronomy 1:40 Or the Sea of Reeds Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	2	Then the Lord said to me ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	3	‘ You have made your way around this hill country long enough ; now turn north .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	4	Give the people these orders : “ You are about to pass through the territory of your relatives the descendants of Esau , who live in Seir . They will be afraid of you , but be very careful .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	5	Do not provoke them to war , for I will not give you any of their land , not even enough to put your foot on . I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	6	You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink. ” ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	7	The Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands . He has watched over your journey through this vast wilderness . These forty years the Lord your God has been with you , and you have not lacked anything .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	8	So we went on past our relatives the descendants of Esau , who live in Seir . We turned from the Arabah road , which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber , and travelled along the desert road of Moab .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	9	Then the Lord said to me , ‘ Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war , for I will not give you any part of their land . I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	10	( The Emites used to live there – a people strong and numerous , and as tall as the Anakites .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	11	Like the Anakites , they too were considered Rephaites , but the Moabites called them Emites .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	12	Horites used to live in Seir , but the descendants of Esau drove them out . They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place , just as Israel did in the land the Lord gave them as their possession . )
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	13	And the Lord said , ‘ Now get up and cross the Zered Valley. ’ So we crossed the valley .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	14	Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley . By then , that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp , as the Lord had sworn to them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	15	The Lord ’ s hand was against them until he had completely eliminated them from the camp .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	16	Now when the last of these fighting men among the people had died ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	17	the Lord said to me ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	18	‘ Today you are to pass by the region of Moab at Ar .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	19	When you come to the Ammonites , do not harass them or provoke them to war , for I will not give you possession of any land belonging to the Ammonites . I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	20	( That too was considered a land of the Rephaites , who used to live there ; but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	21	They were a people strong and numerous , and as tall as the Anakites . The Lord destroyed them from before the Ammonites , who drove them out and settled in their place .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	22	The Lord had done the same for the descendants of Esau , who lived in Seir , when he destroyed the Horites from before them . They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	23	And as for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza , the Caphtorites coming out from Caphtor [ b ] destroyed them and settled in their place . ) Defeat of Sihon king of Heshbon
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	24	‘ Set out now and cross the Arnon Gorge . See , I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite , king of Heshbon , and his country . Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	25	This very day I will begin to put the terror and fear of you on all the nations under heaven . They will hear reports of you and will tremble and be in anguish because of you. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	26	From the Desert of Kedemoth I sent messengers to Sihon king of Heshbon offering peace and saying ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	27	‘ Let us pass through your country . We will stay on the main road ; we will not turn aside to the right or to the left .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	28	Sell us food to eat and water to drink for their price in silver . Only let us pass through on foot –
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	29	as the descendants of Esau , who live in Seir , and the Moabites , who live in Ar , did for us – until we cross the Jordan into the land the Lord our God is giving us. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	30	But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to let us pass through . For the Lord your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to give him into your hands , as he has now done .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	31	The Lord said to me , ‘ See , I have begun to deliver Sihon and his country over to you . Now begin to conquer and possess his land. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	32	When Sihon and all his army came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	33	the Lord our God delivered him over to us and we struck him down , together with his sons and his whole army .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	34	At that time we took all his towns and completely destroyed [ c ] them – men , women and children . We left no survivors .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	35	But the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured we carried off for ourselves .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	36	From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge , and from the town in the gorge , even as far as Gilead , not one town was too strong for us . The Lord our God gave us all of them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	2	37	But in accordance with the command of the Lord our God , you did not encroach on any of the land of the Ammonites , neither the land along the course of the Jabbok nor that around the towns in the hills .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	5	All these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars , and there were also a great many unwalled villages .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	6	We completely destroyed [ a ] them , as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon , destroying [ b ] every city – men , women and children .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	7	But all the livestock and the plunder from their cities we carried off for ourselves .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	8	So at that time we took from these two kings of the Amorites the territory east of the Jordan , from the Arnon Gorge as far as Mount Hermon .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	9	( Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians ; the Amorites call it Senir . )
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	10	We took all the towns on the plateau , and all Gilead , and all Bashan as far as Salekah and Edrei , towns of Og ’ s kingdom in Bashan .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	11	( Og king of Bashan was the last of the Rephaites . His bed was decorated with iron and was more than nine cubits long and four cubits wide . [ c ] It is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites . ) Division of the land
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	12	Of the land that we took over at that time , I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory north of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge , including half the hill country of Gilead , together with its towns .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	13	The rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan , the kingdom of Og , I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh . ( The whole region of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	14	Jair , a descendant of Manasseh , took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maakathites ; it was named after him , so that to this day Bashan is called Havvoth Jair . [ d ] )
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	15	And I gave Gilead to Makir .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	16	But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge ( the middle of the gorge being the border ) and out to the River Jabbok , which is the border of the Ammonites .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	17	Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah , from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah ( that is , the Dead Sea ) , below the slopes of Pisgah .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	18	I commanded you at that time : ‘ The Lord your God has given you this land to take possession of it . But all your able-bodied men , armed for battle , must cross over ahead of the other Israelites .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	19	However , your wives , your children and your livestock ( I know you have much livestock ) may stay in the towns I have given you ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	20	until the Lord gives rest to your fellow Israelites as he has to you , and they too have taken over the land that the Lord your God is giving them across the Jordan . After that , each of you may go back to the possession I have given you. ’ Moses forbidden to cross the Jordan
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	21	At that time I commanded Joshua : ‘ You have seen with your own eyes all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings . The Lord will do the same to all the kingdoms over there where you are going .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	22	Do not be afraid of them ; the Lord your God himself will fight for you. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	23	At that time I pleaded with the Lord :
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	24	‘ Sovereign Lord , you have begun to show to your servant your greatness and your strong hand . For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do the deeds and mighty works you do ?
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	25	Let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan – that fine hill country and Lebanon. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	26	But because of you the Lord was angry with me and would not listen to me . ‘ That is enough , ’ the Lord said . ‘ Do not speak to me any more about this matter .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	27	Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west and north and south and east . Look at the land with your own eyes , since you are not going to cross this Jordan .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	3	28	But commission Joshua , and encourage and strengthen him , for he will lead this people across and will cause them to inherit the land that you will see. ’

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	2	Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it , but keep the commands of the Lord your God that I give you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	3	You saw with your own eyes what the Lord did at Baal Peor . The Lord your God destroyed from among you everyone who followed the Baal of Peor ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	5	See , I have taught you decrees and laws as the Lord my God commanded me , so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to take possession of it .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	6	Observe them carefully , for this will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations , who will hear about all these decrees and say , ‘ Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	7	What other nation is so great as to have their gods near them the way the Lord our God is near us whenever we pray to him ?
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	8	And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today ?
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	9	Only be careful , and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them fade from your heart as long as you live . Teach them to your children and to their children after them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	10	Remember the day you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb , when he said to me , ‘ Assemble the people before me to hear my words so that they may learn to revere me as long as they live in the land and may teach them to their children. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	11	You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire to the very heavens , with black clouds and deep darkness .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	12	Then the Lord spoke to you out of the fire . You heard the sound of words but saw no form ; there was only a voice .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	13	He declared to you his covenant , the Ten Commandments , which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	14	And the Lord directed me at that time to teach you the decrees and laws you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess . Idolatry forbidden
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	15	You saw no form of any kind the day the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire . Therefore watch yourselves very carefully ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	16	so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol , an image of any shape , whether formed like a man or a woman ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	17	or like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the air ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	18	or like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish in the waters below .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	19	And when you look up to the sky and see the sun , the moon and the stars – all the heavenly array – do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshipping things the Lord your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	20	But as for you , the Lord took you and brought you out of the iron-smelting furnace , out of Egypt , to be the people of his inheritance , as you now are .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	21	The Lord was angry with me because of you , and he solemnly swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the Lord your God is giving you as your inheritance .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	22	I will die in this land ; I will not cross the Jordan ; but you are about to cross over and take possession of that good land .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	23	Be careful not to forget the covenant of the Lord your God that he made with you ; do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the Lord your God has forbidden .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	24	For the Lord your God is a consuming fire , a jealous God .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	25	After you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time – if you then become corrupt and make any kind of idol , doing evil in the eyes of the Lord your God and arousing his anger ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	26	I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess . You will not live there long but will certainly be destroyed .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	27	The Lord will scatter you among the peoples , and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the Lord will drive you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	28	There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone , which can not see or hear or eat or smell .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	29	But if from there you seek the Lord your God , you will find him if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	30	When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you , then in later days you will return to the Lord your God and obey him .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	31	For the Lord your God is a merciful God ; he will not abandon or destroy you or forget the covenant with your ancestors , which he confirmed to them by oath . The Lord is God
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	32	Ask now about the former days , long before your time , from the day God created human beings on the earth ; ask from one end of the heavens to the other . Has anything so great as this ever happened , or has anything like it ever been heard of ?
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	33	Has any other people heard the voice of God [ a ] speaking out of fire , as you have , and lived ?
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	34	Has any god ever tried to take for himself one nation out of another nation , by testings , by signs and wonders , by war , by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm , or by great and awesome deeds , like all the things the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes ?
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	35	You were shown these things so that you might know that the Lord is God ; besides him there is no other .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	36	From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you . On earth he showed you his great fire , and you heard his words from out of the fire .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	37	Because he loved your ancestors and chose their descendants after them , he brought you out of Egypt by his Presence and his great strength ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	38	to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you into their land to give it to you for your inheritance , as it is today .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	39	Acknowledge and take to heart this day that the Lord is God in heaven above and on the earth below . There is no other .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	40	Keep his decrees and commands , which I am giving you today , so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may live long in the land the Lord your God gives you for all time . Cities of refuge
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	41	Then Moses set aside three cities east of the Jordan ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	42	to which anyone who had killed a person could flee if they had unintentionally killed a neighbour without malice aforethought . They could flee into one of these cities and save their life .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	43	The cities were these : Bezer in the wilderness plateau , for the Reubenites ; Ramoth in Gilead , for the Gadites ; and Golan in Bashan , for the Manassites . Introduction to the law
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	44	This is the law Moses set before the Israelites .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	45	These are the stipulations , decrees and laws Moses gave them when they came out of Egypt
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	46	and were in the valley near Beth Peor east of the Jordan , in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites , who reigned in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses and the Israelites as they came out of Egypt .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	47	They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan , the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	48	This land extended from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge to Mount Sirion [ b ] ( that is , Hermon ) ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	4	49	and included all the Arabah east of the Jordan , as far as the Dead Sea , [ c ] below the slopes of Pisgah .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	2	The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Horeb .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	3	It was not with our ancestors [ a ] that the Lord made this covenant , but with us , with all of us who are alive here today .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	4	The Lord spoke to you face to face out of the fire on the mountain .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	6	‘ I am the Lord your God , who brought you out of Egypt , out of the land of slavery .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	7	‘ You shall have no other gods before [ b ] me .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	8	‘ You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	11	‘ You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God , for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	13	Six days you shall labour and do all your work ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	14	but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God . On it you shall not do any work , neither you , nor your son or daughter , nor your male or female servant , nor your ox , your donkey or any of your animals , nor any foreigner residing in your towns , so that your male and female servants may rest , as you do .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	15	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm . Therefore the Lord your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	16	‘ Honour your father and your mother , as the Lord your God has commanded you , so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land the Lord your God is giving you .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	21	‘ You shall not covet your neighbour ’ s wife . You shall not set your desire on your neighbour ’ s house or land , his male or female servant , his ox or donkey , or anything that belongs to your neighbour. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	22	These are the commandments the Lord proclaimed in a loud voice to your whole assembly there on the mountain from out of the fire , the cloud and the deep darkness ; and he added nothing more . Then he wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	23	When you heard the voice out of the darkness , while the mountain was ablaze with fire , all the leaders of your tribes and your elders came to me .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	24	And you said , ‘ The Lord our God has shown us his glory and his majesty , and we have heard his voice from the fire . Today we have seen that a person can live even if God speaks with them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	25	But now , why should we die ? This great fire will consume us , and we will die if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any longer .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	26	For what mortal has ever heard the voice of the living God speaking out of fire , as we have , and survived ?
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	27	Go near and listen to all that the Lord our God says . Then tell us whatever the Lord our God tells you . We will listen and obey. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	28	The Lord heard you when you spoke to me , and the Lord said to me , ‘ I have heard what this people said to you . Everything they said was good .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	5	29	Oh , that their hearts would be inclined to fear me and keep all my commands always , so that it might go well with them and their children for ever !

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	7	15	The Lord will keep you free from every disease . He will not inflict on you the horrible diseases you knew in Egypt , but he will inflict them on all who hate you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	7	16	You must destroy all the peoples the Lord your God gives over to you . Do not look on them with pity and do not serve their gods , for that will be a snare to you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	7	17	You may say to yourselves , ‘ These nations are stronger than we are . How can we drive them out ? ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	7	18	But do not be afraid of them ; remember well what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	7	19	You saw with your own eyes the great trials , the signs and wonders , the mighty hand and outstretched arm , with which the Lord your God brought you out . The Lord your God will do the same to all the peoples you now fear .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	7	20	Moreover , the Lord your God will send the hornet among them until even the survivors who hide from you have perished .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	7	21	Do not be terrified by them , for the Lord your God , who is among you , is a great and awesome God .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	7	22	The Lord your God will drive out those nations before you , little by little . You will not be allowed to eliminate them all at once , or the wild animals will multiply around you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	7	23	But the Lord your God will deliver them over to you , throwing them into great confusion until they are destroyed .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	7	24	He will give their kings into your hand , and you will wipe out their names from under heaven . No one will be able to stand up against you ; you will destroy them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	7	25	The images of their gods you are to burn in the fire . Do not covet the silver and gold on them , and do not take it for yourselves , or you will be ensnared by it , for it is detestable to the Lord your God .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	8	8	a land with wheat and barley , vines and fig-trees , pomegranates , olive oil and honey ;
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	8	2	Remember how the Lord your God led you all the way in the wilderness these forty years , to humble and test you in order to know what was in your heart , whether or not you would keep his commands .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	8	3	He humbled you , causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna , which neither you nor your ancestors had known , to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	8	4	Your clothes did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	8	5	Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son , so the Lord your God disciplines you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	8	6	Observe the commands of the Lord your God , walking in obedience to him and revering him .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	8	7	For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land – a land with brooks , streams , and deep springs gushing out into the valleys and hills ;
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	8	9	a land where bread will not be scarce and you will lack nothing ; a land where the rocks are iron and you can dig copper out of the hills .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	8	10	When you have eaten and are satisfied , praise the Lord your God for the good land he has given you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	8	11	Be careful that you do not forget the Lord your God , failing to observe his commands , his laws and his decrees that I am giving you this day .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	8	12	Otherwise , when you eat and are satisfied , when you build fine houses and settle down ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	8	13	and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	8	14	then your heart will become proud and you will forget the Lord your God , who brought you out of Egypt , out of the land of slavery .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	8	15	He led you through the vast and dreadful wilderness , that thirsty and waterless land , with its venomous snakes and scorpions . He brought you water out of hard rock .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	8	16	He gave you manna to eat in the wilderness , something your ancestors had never known , to humble and test you so that in the end it might go well with you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	8	17	You may say to yourself , ‘ My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	8	18	But remember the Lord your God , for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth , and so confirms his covenant , which he swore to your ancestors , as it is today .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	8	19	If you ever forget the Lord your God and follow other gods and worship and bow down to them , I testify against you today that you will surely be destroyed .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	9	When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone , the tablets of the covenant that the Lord had made with you , I stayed on the mountain for forty days and forty nights ; I ate no bread and drank no water .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	2	The people are strong and tall – Anakites ! You know about them and have heard it said : ‘ Who can stand up against the Anakites ? ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	3	But be assured today that the Lord your God is the one who goes across ahead of you like a devouring fire . He will destroy them ; he will subdue them before you . And you will drive them out and annihilate them quickly , as the Lord has promised you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	4	After the Lord your God has driven them out before you , do not say to yourself , ‘ The Lord has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my righteousness. ’ No , it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is going to drive them out before you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	5	It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land ; but on account of the wickedness of these nations , the Lord your God will drive them out before you , to accomplish what he swore to your fathers , to Abraham , Isaac and Jacob .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	6	Understand , then , that it is not because of your righteousness that the Lord your God is giving you this good land to possess , for you are a stiff-necked people . The golden calf
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	7	Remember this and never forget how you aroused the anger of the Lord your God in the wilderness . From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here , you have been rebellious against the Lord .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	8	At Horeb you aroused the Lord ’ s wrath so that he was angry enough to destroy you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	10	The Lord gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God . On them were all the commandments the Lord proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire , on the day of the assembly .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	11	At the end of the forty days and forty nights , the Lord gave me the two stone tablets , the tablets of the covenant .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	12	Then the Lord told me , ‘ Go down from here at once , because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt . They have turned away quickly from what I commanded them and have made an idol for themselves. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	13	And the Lord said to me , ‘ I have seen this people , and they are a stiff-necked people indeed !
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	14	Let me alone , so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven . And I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	15	So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire . And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	16	When I looked , I saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God ; you had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf . You had turned aside quickly from the way that the Lord had commanded you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	17	So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands , breaking them to pieces before your eyes .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	18	Then once again I fell prostrate before the Lord for forty days and forty nights ; I ate no bread and drank no water , because of all the sin you had committed , doing what was evil in the Lord ’ s sight and so arousing his anger .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	19	I feared the anger and wrath of the Lord , for he was angry enough with you to destroy you . But again the Lord listened to me .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	20	And the Lord was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him , but at that time I prayed for Aaron too .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	21	Also I took that sinful thing of yours , the calf you had made , and burned it in the fire . Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	22	You also made the Lord angry at Taberah , at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	23	And when the Lord sent you out from Kadesh Barnea , he said , ‘ Go up and take possession of the land I have given you. ’ But you rebelled against the command of the Lord your God . You did not trust him or obey him .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	24	You have been rebellious against the Lord ever since I have known you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	25	I lay prostrate before the Lord those forty days and forty nights because the Lord had said he would destroy you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	26	I prayed to the Lord and said , ‘ Sovereign Lord , do not destroy your people , your own inheritance that you redeemed by your great power and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	27	Remember your servants Abraham , Isaac and Jacob . Overlook the stubbornness of this people , their wickedness and their sin .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	9	28	Otherwise , the country from which you brought us will say , “ Because the Lord was not able to take them into the land he had promised them , and because he hated them , he brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness. ”

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	10	Now I had stayed on the mountain for forty days and forty nights , as I did the first time , and the Lord listened to me at this time also . It was not his will to destroy you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	2	I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets , which you broke . Then you are to put them in the ark. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	3	So I made the ark out of acacia wood and chiselled out two stone tablets like the first ones , and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	4	The Lord wrote on these tablets what he had written before , the Ten Commandments he had proclaimed to you on the mountain , out of the fire , on the day of the assembly . And the Lord gave them to me .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	5	Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made , as the Lord commanded me , and they are there now .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	6	( The Israelites travelled from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah . There Aaron died and was buried , and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	7	From there they travelled to Gudgodah and on to Jotbathah , a land with streams of water .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	8	At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord , to stand before the Lord to minister and to pronounce blessings in his name , as they still do today .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	9	That is why the Levites have no share or inheritance among their fellow Israelites ; the Lord is their inheritance , as the Lord your God told them . )
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	11	‘ Go , ’ the Lord said to me , ‘ and lead the people on their way , so that they may enter and possess the land that I swore to their ancestors to give them. ’ Fear the Lord
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	12	And now , Israel , what does the Lord your God ask of you but to fear the Lord your God , to walk in obedience to him , to love him , to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	13	and to observe the Lord ’ s commands and decrees that I am giving you today for your own good ?
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	14	To the Lord your God belong the heavens , even the highest heavens , the earth and everything in it .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	15	Yet the Lord set his affection on your ancestors and loved them , and he chose you , their descendants , above all the nations – as it is today .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	16	Circumcise your hearts , therefore , and do not be stiff-necked any longer .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	17	For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords , the great God , mighty and awesome , who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	18	He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow , and loves the foreigner residing among you , giving them food and clothing .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	19	And you are to love those who are foreigners , for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	20	Fear the Lord your God and serve him . Hold fast to him and take your oaths in his name .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	21	He is your praise ; he is your God , who performed for you those great and awesome wonders you saw with your own eyes .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	10	22	Your ancestors who went down into Egypt were seventy in all , and now the Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky . Footnotes - Deuteronomy 10:1 That is , a chest Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	11	But the land you are crossing the Jordan to take possession of is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks rain from heaven .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	2	Remember today that your children were not the ones who saw and experienced the discipline of the Lord your God : his majesty , his mighty hand , his outstretched arm ;
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	3	the signs he performed and the things he did in the heart of Egypt , both to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his whole country ;
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	4	what he did to the Egyptian army , to its horses and chariots , how he overwhelmed them with the waters of the Red Sea [ a ] as they were pursuing you , and how the Lord brought lasting ruin on them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	5	It was not your children who saw what he did for you in the wilderness until you arrived at this place ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	6	and what he did to Dathan and Abiram , sons of Eliab the Reubenite , when the earth opened its mouth right in the middle of all Israel and swallowed them up with their households , their tents and every living thing that belonged to them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	7	But it was your own eyes that saw all these great things the Lord has done .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	8	Observe therefore all the commands I am giving you today , so that you may have the strength to go in and take over the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	9	and so that you may live long in the land that the Lord swore to your ancestors to give to them and their descendants , a land flowing with milk and honey .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	10	The land you are entering to take over is not like the land of Egypt , from which you have come , where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot as in a vegetable garden .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	12	It is a land the Lord your God cares for ; the eyes of the Lord your God are continually on it from the beginning of the year to its end .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	13	So if you faithfully obey the commands I am giving you today – to love the Lord your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul –
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	14	then I will send rain on your land in its season , both autumn and spring rains , so that you may gather in your corn , new wine and olive oil .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	15	I will provide grass in the fields for your cattle , and you will eat and be satisfied .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	16	Be careful , or you will be enticed to turn away and worship other gods and bow down to them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	17	Then the Lord ’ s anger will burn against you , and he will shut the heavens so that it will not rain and the ground will yield no produce , and you will soon perish from the good land the Lord is giving you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	18	Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds ; tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	19	Teach them to your children , talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road , when you lie down and when you get up .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	20	Write them on the door-frames of your houses and on your gates ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	21	so that your days and the days of your children may be many in the land that the Lord swore to give your ancestors , as many as the days that the heavens are above the earth .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	22	If you carefully observe all these commands I am giving you to follow – to love the Lord your God , to walk in obedience to him and to hold fast to him –
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	23	then the Lord will drive out all these nations before you , and you will dispossess nations larger and stronger than you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	24	Every place where you set your foot will be yours : your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon , and from the River Euphrates to the Mediterranean Sea .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	25	No one will be able to stand against you . The Lord your God , as he promised you , will put the terror and fear of you on the whole land , wherever you go .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	26	See , I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse –
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	27	the blessing if you obey the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you today ;
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	28	the curse if you disobey the commands of the Lord your God and turn from the way that I command you today by following other gods , which you have not known .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	29	When the Lord your God has brought you into the land you are entering to possess , you are to proclaim on Mount Gerizim the blessings , and on Mount Ebal the curses .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	30	As you know , these mountains are across the Jordan , westward , towards the setting sun , near the great trees of Moreh , in the territory of those Canaanites living in the Arabah in the vicinity of Gilgal .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	11	31	You are about to cross the Jordan to enter and take possession of the land the Lord your God is giving you . When you have taken it over and are living there ,

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	12	And there rejoice before the Lord your God – you , your sons and daughters , your male and female servants , and the Levites from your towns who have no land allotted to them or any inheritance of their own .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	2	Destroy completely all the places on the high mountains , on the hills and under every spreading tree , where the nations you are dispossessing worship their gods .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	3	Break down their altars , smash their sacred stones and burn their Asherah poles in the fire ; cut down the idols of their gods and wipe out their names from those places .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	4	You must not worship the Lord your God in their way .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	5	But you are to seek the place the Lord your God will choose from among all your tribes to put his Name there for his dwelling . To that place you must go ;
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	6	there bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices , your tithes and special gifts , what you have vowed to give and your freewill offerings , and the firstborn of your herds and flocks .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	7	There , in the presence of the Lord your God , you and your families shall eat and shall rejoice in everything you have put your hand to , because the Lord your God has blessed you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	8	You are not to do as we do here today , everyone doing as they see fit ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	9	since you have not yet reached the resting place and the inheritance the Lord your God is giving you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	10	But you will cross the Jordan and settle in the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance , and he will give you rest from all your enemies around you so that you will live in safety .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	11	Then to the place the Lord your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name – there you are to bring everything I command you : your burnt offerings and sacrifices , your tithes and special gifts , and all the choice possessions you have vowed to the Lord .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	13	Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings anywhere you please .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	14	Offer them only at the place the Lord will choose in one of your tribes , and there observe everything I command you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	15	Nevertheless , you may slaughter your animals in any of your towns and eat as much of the meat as you want , as if it were gazelle or deer , according to the blessing the Lord your God gives you . Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	16	But you must not eat the blood ; pour it out on the ground like water .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	17	You must not eat in your own towns the tithe of your corn and new wine and olive oil , or the firstborn of your herds and flocks , or whatever you have vowed to give , or your freewill offerings or special gifts .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	18	Instead , you are to eat them in the presence of the Lord your God at the place the Lord your God will choose – you , your sons and daughters , your male and female servants , and the Levites from your towns – and you are to rejoice before the Lord your God in everything you put your hand to .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	19	Be careful not to neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	20	When the Lord your God has enlarged your territory as he promised you , and you crave meat and say , ‘ I would like some meat , ’ then you may eat as much of it as you want .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	21	If the place where the Lord your God chooses to put his Name is too far away from you , you may slaughter animals from the herds and flocks the Lord has given you , as I have commanded you , and in your own towns you may eat as much of them as you want .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	22	Eat them as you would gazelle or deer . Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	23	But be sure you do not eat the blood , because the blood is the life , and you must not eat the life with the meat .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	24	You must not eat the blood ; pour it out on the ground like water .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	25	Do not eat it , so that it may go well with you and your children after you , because you will be doing what is right in the eyes of the Lord .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	27	Present your burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord your God , both the meat and the blood . The blood of your sacrifices must be poured beside the altar of the Lord your God , but you may eat the meat .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	12	29	The Lord your God will cut off before you the nations you are about to invade and dispossess . But when you have driven them out and settled in their land ,

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	14	7	However , of those that chew the cud or that have a divided hoof you may not eat the camel , the hare or the hyrax . Although they chew the cud , they do not have a divided hoof ; they are ceremonially unclean for you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	14	8	The pig is also unclean ; although it has a divided hoof , it does not chew the cud . You are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	14	22	Be sure to set aside a tenth of all that your fields produce each year .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	14	23	Eat the tithe of your corn , new wine and olive oil , and the firstborn of your herds and flocks in the presence of the Lord your God at the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name , so that you may learn to revere the Lord your God always .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	14	25	then exchange your tithe for silver , and take the silver with you and go to the place the Lord your God will choose .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	14	26	Use the silver to buy whatever you like : cattle , sheep , wine or other fermented drink , or anything you wish . Then you and your household shall eat there in the presence of the Lord your God and rejoice .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	14	27	And do not neglect the Levites living in your towns , for they have no land allotted to them or any inheritance of their own .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	15	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed you . That is why I give you this command today .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	2	This is how it is to be done : every creditor shall cancel any loan they have made to a fellow Israelite . They shall not require payment from anyone among their own people , because the Lord ’ s time for cancelling debts has been proclaimed .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	3	You may require payment from a foreigner , but you must cancel any debt your fellow Israelite owes you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	4	However , there need be no poor people among you , for in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess as your inheritance , he will richly bless you ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	5	if only you fully obey the Lord your God and are careful to follow all these commands I am giving you today .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	6	For the Lord your God will bless you as he has promised , and you will lend to many nations but will borrow from none . You will rule over many nations but none will rule over you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	7	If anyone is poor among your fellow Israelites in any of the towns of the land that the Lord your God is giving you , do not be hard-hearted or tight-fisted towards them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	8	Rather , be open-handed and freely lend them whatever they need .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	9	Be careful not to harbour this wicked thought : ‘ The seventh year , the year for cancelling debts , is near , ’ so that you do not show ill will towards the needy among your fellow Israelites and give them nothing . They may then appeal to the Lord against you , and you will be found guilty of sin .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	10	Give generously to them and do so without a grudging heart ; then because of this the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	11	There will always be poor people in the land . Therefore I command you to be open-handed towards your fellow Israelites who are poor and needy in your land . Freeing servants
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	12	If any of your people – Hebrew men or women – sell themselves to you and serve you for six years , in the seventh year you must let them go free .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	13	And when you release them , do not send them away empty-handed .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	14	Supply them liberally from your flock , your threshing-floor and your winepress . Give to them as the Lord your God has blessed you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	16	But if your servant says to you , ‘ I do not want to leave you , ’ because he loves you and your family and is well off with you ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	17	then take an awl and push it through his ear lobe into the door , and he will become your servant for life . Do the same for your female servant .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	18	Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free , because their service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired hand . And the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do . The firstborn animals
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	19	Set apart for the Lord your God every firstborn male of your herds and flocks . Do not put the firstborn of your oxen to work , and do not shear the firstborn of your sheep .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	20	Each year you and your family are to eat them in the presence of the Lord your God at the place he will choose .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	21	If an animal has a defect , is lame or blind , or has any serious flaw , you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	15	22	You are to eat it in your own towns . Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it , as if it were gazelle or deer .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	16	2	Sacrifice as the Passover to the Lord your God an animal from your flock or herd at the place the Lord will choose as a dwelling for his Name .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	16	3	Do not eat it with bread made with yeast , but for seven days eat unleavened bread , the bread of affliction , because you left Egypt in haste – so that all the days of your life you may remember the time of your departure from Egypt .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	16	4	Let no yeast be found in your possession in all your land for seven days . Do not let any of the meat you sacrifice on the evening of the first day remain until morning .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	16	5	You must not sacrifice the Passover in any town the Lord your God gives you
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	16	6	except in the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name . There you must sacrifice the Passover in the evening , when the sun goes down , on the anniversary [ a ] of your departure from Egypt .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	16	12	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt , and follow carefully these decrees . The Festival of Tabernacles
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	16	13	Celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles for seven days after you have gathered the produce of your threshing-floor and your winepress .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	16	14	Be joyful at your festival – you , your sons and daughters , your male and female servants , and the Levites , the foreigners , the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	16	15	For seven days celebrate the festival to the Lord your God at the place the Lord will choose . For the Lord your God will bless you in all your harvest and in all the work of your hands , and your joy will be complete .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	16	17	each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the Lord your God has blessed you . Judges
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	16	18	Appoint judges and officials for each of your tribes in every town the Lord your God is giving you , and they shall judge the people fairly .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	16	19	Do not pervert justice or show partiality . Do not accept a bribe , for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the innocent .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	16	20	Follow justice and justice alone , so that you may live and possess the land the Lord your God is giving you . Worshipping other gods
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	16	21	Do not set up any wooden Asherah pole beside the altar you build to the Lord your God ,

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	17	17	He must not take many wives , or his heart will be led astray . He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	17	2	If a man or woman living among you in one of the towns the Lord gives you is found doing evil in the eyes of the Lord your God in violation of his covenant ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	17	3	and contrary to my command has worshipped other gods , bowing down to them or to the sun or the moon or the stars in the sky ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	17	4	and this has been brought to your attention , then you must investigate it thoroughly . If it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done in Israel ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	17	5	take the man or woman who has done this evil deed to your city gate and stone that person to death .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	17	6	On the testimony of two or three witnesses a person is to be put to death , but no one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	17	7	The hands of the witnesses must be the first in putting that person to death , and then the hands of all the people . You must purge the evil from among you . Law courts
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	17	8	If cases come before your courts that are too difficult for you to judge – whether bloodshed , lawsuits or assaults – take them to the place the Lord your God will choose .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	17	12	Anyone who shows contempt for the judge or for the priest who stands ministering there to the Lord your God is to be put to death . You must purge the evil from Israel .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	17	13	All the people will hear and be afraid , and will not be contemptuous again . The king
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	17	14	When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you and have taken possession of it and settled in it , and you say , ‘ Let us set a king over us like all the nations around us , ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	17	15	be sure to appoint over you a king the Lord your God chooses . He must be from among your fellow Israelites . Do not place a foreigner over you , one who is not an Israelite .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	17	16	The king , moreover , must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself or make the people return to Egypt to get more of them , for the Lord has told you , ‘ You are not to go back that way again. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	17	18	When he takes the throne of his kingdom , he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this law , taken from that of the Levitical priests .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	17	19	It is to be with him , and he is to read it all the days of his life so that he may learn to revere the Lord his God and follow carefully all the words of this law and these decrees

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	18	I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites , and I will put my words in his mouth . He will tell them everything I command him .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	2	They shall have no inheritance among their fellow Israelites ; the Lord is their inheritance , as he promised them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	3	This is the share due to the priests from the people who sacrifice a bull or a sheep : the shoulder , the internal organs and the meat from the head .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	4	You are to give them the firstfruits of your corn , new wine and olive oil , and the first wool from the shearing of your sheep ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	5	for the Lord your God has chosen them and their descendants out of all your tribes to stand and minister in the Lord ’ s name always .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	6	If a Levite moves from one of your towns anywhere in Israel where he is living , and comes in all earnestness to the place the Lord will choose ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	7	he may minister in the name of the Lord his God like all his fellow Levites who serve there in the presence of the Lord .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	8	He is to share equally in their benefits even though he has received money from the sale of family possessions . Occult practices

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	10	Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire , who practises divination or sorcery , interprets omens , engages in witchcraft ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	11	or casts spells , or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	12	Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord ; because of these same detestable practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	13	You must be blameless before the Lord your God . The prophet
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	14	The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practise sorcery or divination . But as for you , the Lord your God has not permitted you to do so .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	15	The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you , from your fellow Israelites . You must listen to him .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	16	For this is what you asked of the Lord your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said , ‘ Let us not hear the voice of the Lord our God nor see this great fire any more , or we will die. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	17	The Lord said to me : ‘ What they say is good .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	19	I myself will call to account anyone who does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	20	But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded , or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods , is to be put to death. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	21	You may say to yourselves , ‘ How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the Lord ? ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	18	22	If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the Lord does not take place or come true , that is a message the Lord has not spoken . That prophet has spoken presumptuously , so do not be alarmed . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	19	then do to the false witness as that witness intended to do to the other party . You must purge the evil from among you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	2	then set aside for yourselves three cities in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	3	Determine the distances involved and divide into three parts the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance , so that a person who kills someone may flee for refuge to one of these cities .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	4	This is the rule concerning anyone who kills a person and flees there for safety – anyone who kills a neighbour unintentionally , without malice aforethought .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	5	For instance , a man may go into the forest with his neighbour to cut wood , and as he swings his axe to fell a tree , the head may fly off and hit his neighbour and kill him . That man may flee to one of these cities and save his life .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	6	Otherwise , the avenger of blood might pursue him in a rage , overtake him if the distance is too great , and kill him even though he is not deserving of death , since he did it to his neighbour without malice aforethought .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	7	This is why I command you to set aside for yourselves three cities .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	8	If the Lord your God enlarges your territory , as he promised on oath to your ancestors , and gives you the whole land he promised them ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	9	because you carefully follow all these laws I command you today – to love the Lord your God and to walk always in obedience to him – then you are to set aside three more cities .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	10	Do this so that innocent blood will not be shed in your land , which the Lord your God is giving you as your inheritance , and so that you will not be guilty of bloodshed .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	11	But if out of hate someone lies in wait , assaults and kills a neighbour , and then flees to one of these cities ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	12	the killer shall be sent for by the town elders , be brought back from the city , and be handed over to the avenger of blood to die .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	13	Show no pity . You must purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood , so that it may go well with you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	14	Do not move your neighbour ’ s boundary stone set up by your predecessors in the inheritance you receive in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess . Witnesses
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	15	One witness is not enough to convict anyone accused of any crime or offence they may have committed . A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	16	If a malicious witness takes the stand to accuse someone of a crime ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	17	the two people involved in the dispute must stand in the presence of the Lord before the priests and the judges who are in office at the time .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	18	The judges must make a thorough investigation , and if the witness proves to be a liar , giving false testimony against a fellow Israelite ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	19	20	The rest of the people will hear of this and be afraid , and never again will such an evil thing be done among you .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	20	14	As for the women , the children , the livestock and everything else in the city , you may take these as plunder for yourselves . And you may use the plunder the Lord your God gives you from your enemies .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	20	15	This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	30	You will be pledged to be married to a woman , but another will take her and rape her . You will build a house , but you will not live in it . You will plant a vineyard , but you will not even begin to enjoy its fruit .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	31	Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes , but you will eat none of it . Your donkey will be forcibly taken from you and will not be returned . Your sheep will be given to your enemies , and no one will rescue them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	32	Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation , and you will wear out your eyes watching for them day after day , powerless to lift a hand .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	33	A people that you do not know will eat what your land and labour produce , and you will have nothing but cruel oppression all your days .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	34	The sights you see will drive you mad .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	35	The Lord will afflict your knees and legs with painful boils that can not be cured , spreading from the soles of your feet to the top of your head .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	36	The Lord will drive you and the king you set over you to a nation unknown to you or your ancestors . There you will worship other gods , gods of wood and stone .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	37	You will become a thing of horror , a byword and an object of ridicule among all the peoples where the Lord will drive you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	38	You will sow much seed in the field but you will harvest little , because locusts will devour it .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	39	You will plant vineyards and cultivate them but you will not drink the wine or gather the grapes , because worms will eat them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	40	You will have olive trees throughout your country but you will not use the oil , because the olives will drop off .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	41	You will have sons and daughters but you will not keep them , because they will go into captivity .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	42	Swarms of locusts will take over all your trees and the crops of your land .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	43	The foreigners who reside among you will rise above you higher and higher , but you will sink lower and lower .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	44	They will lend to you , but you will not lend to them . They will be the head , but you will be the tail .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	45	All these curses will come on you . They will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed , because you did not obey the Lord your God and observe the commands and decrees he gave you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	46	They will be a sign and a wonder to you and your descendants for ever .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	47	Because you did not serve the Lord your God joyfully and gladly in the time of prosperity ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	48	therefore in hunger and thirst , in nakedness and dire poverty , you will serve the enemies the Lord sends against you . He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	49	The Lord will bring a nation against you from far away , from the ends of the earth , like an eagle swooping down , a nation whose language you will not understand ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	50	a fierce-looking nation without respect for the old or pity for the young .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	51	They will devour the young of your livestock and the crops of your land until you are destroyed . They will leave you no corn , new wine or olive oil , nor any calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks until you are ruined .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	52	They will lay siege to all the cities throughout your land until the high fortified walls in which you trust fall down . They will besiege all the cities throughout the land the Lord your God is giving you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	53	Because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege , you will eat the fruit of the womb , the flesh of the sons and daughters the Lord your God has given you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	54	Even the most gentle and sensitive man among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his surviving children ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	55	and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating . It will be all he has left because of the suffering that your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of all your cities .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	56	The most gentle and sensitive woman among you – so sensitive and gentle that she would not venture to touch the ground with the sole of her foot – will begrudge the husband she loves and her own son or daughter
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	57	the afterbirth from her womb and the children she bears . For in her dire need she intends to eat them secretly because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of your cities .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	58	If you do not carefully follow all the words of this law , which are written in this book , and do not revere this glorious and awesome name – the Lord your God –
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	59	the Lord will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants , harsh and prolonged disasters , and severe and lingering illnesses .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	60	He will bring on you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded , and they will cling to you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	61	The Lord will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this Book of the Law , until you are destroyed .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	62	You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number , because you did not obey the Lord your God .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	63	Just as it pleased the Lord to make you prosper and increase in number , so it will please him to ruin and destroy you . You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	64	Then the Lord will scatter you among all nations , from one end of the earth to the other . There you will worship other gods – gods of wood and stone , which neither you nor your ancestors have known .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	65	Among those nations you will find no repose , no resting place for the sole of your foot . There the Lord will give you an anxious mind , eyes weary with longing , and a despairing heart .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	66	You will live in constant suspense , filled with dread both night and day , never sure of your life .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	67	In the morning you will say , ‘ If only it were evening ! ’ and in the evening , ‘ If only it were morning ! ’ – because of the terror that will fill your hearts and the sights that your eyes will see .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	28	68	The Lord will send you back in ships to Egypt on a journey I said you should never make again . There you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves , but no one will buy you .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	2	Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them : Your eyes have seen all that the Lord did in Egypt to Pharaoh , to all his officials and to all his land .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	3	With your own eyes you saw those great trials , those signs and great wonders .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	4	But to this day the Lord has not given you a mind that understands or eyes that see or ears that hear .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	5	Yet the Lord says , ‘ During the forty years that I led you through the wilderness , your clothes did not wear out , nor did the sandals on your feet .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	6	You ate no bread and drank no wine or other fermented drink . I did this so that you might know that I am the Lord your God. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	7	When you reached this place , Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to fight against us , but we defeated them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	8	We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites , the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	9	Carefully follow the terms of this covenant , so that you may prosper in everything you do .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	10	All of you are standing today in the presence of the Lord your God – your leaders and chief men , your elders and officials , and all the other men of Israel ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	11	together with your children and your wives , and the foreigners living in your camps who chop your wood and carry your water .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	12	You are standing here in order to enter into a covenant with the Lord your God , a covenant the Lord is making with you this day and sealing with an oath ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	13	to confirm you this day as his people , that he may be your God as he promised you and as he swore to your fathers , Abraham , Isaac and Jacob .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	14	I am making this covenant , with its oath , not only with you
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	15	who are standing here with us today in the presence of the Lord our God but also with those who are not here today .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	16	You yourselves know how we lived in Egypt and how we passed through the countries on the way here .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	17	You saw among them their detestable images and idols of wood and stone , of silver and gold .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	18	Make sure there is no man or woman , clan or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the Lord our God to go and worship the gods of those nations ; make sure there is no root among you that produces such bitter poison .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	19	When such a person hears the words of this oath and they invoke a blessing on themselves , thinking , ‘ I will be safe , even though I persist in going my own way , ’ they will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	20	The Lord will never be willing to forgive them ; his wrath and zeal will burn against them . All the curses written in this book will fall on them , and the Lord will blot out their names from under heaven .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	21	The Lord will single them out from all the tribes of Israel for disaster , according to all the curses of the covenant written in this Book of the Law .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	22	Your children who follow you in later generations and foreigners who come from distant lands will see the calamities that have fallen on the land and the diseases with which the Lord has afflicted it .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	23	The whole land will be a burning waste of salt and sulphur – nothing planted , nothing sprouting , no vegetation growing on it . It will be like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah , Admah and Zeboyim , which the Lord overthrew in fierce anger .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	24	All the nations will ask : ‘ Why has the Lord done this to this land ? Why this fierce , burning anger ? ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	25	And the answer will be : ‘ It is because this people abandoned the covenant of the Lord , the God of their ancestors , the covenant he made with them when he brought them out of Egypt .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	26	They went off and worshipped other gods and bowed down to them , gods they did not know , gods he had not given them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	27	Therefore the Lord ’ s anger burned against this land , so that he brought on it all the curses written in this book .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	29	28	In furious anger and in great wrath the Lord uprooted them from their land and thrust them into another land , as it is now. ’

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	30	When all these blessings and curses I have set before you come on you and you take them to heart wherever the Lord your God disperses you among the nations ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	2	and when you and your children return to the Lord your God and obey him with all your heart and with all your soul according to everything I command you today ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	3	then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes [ a ] and have compassion on you and gather you again from all the nations where he scattered you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	4	Even if you have been banished to the most distant land under the heavens , from there the Lord your God will gather you and bring you back .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	5	He will bring you to the land that belonged to your ancestors , and you will take possession of it . He will make you more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	6	The Lord your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants , so that you may love him with all your heart and with all your soul , and live .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	7	The Lord your God will put all these curses on your enemies who hate and persecute you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	8	You will again obey the Lord and follow all his commands I am giving you today .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	9	Then the Lord your God will make you most prosperous in all the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb , the young of your livestock and the crops of your land . The Lord will again delight in you and make you prosperous , just as he delighted in your ancestors ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	10	if you obey the Lord your God and keep his commands and decrees that are written in this Book of the Law and turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul . The offer of life or death
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	11	Now what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	12	It is not up in heaven , so that you have to ask , ‘ Who will ascend into heaven to get it and proclaim it to us so that we may obey it ? ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	13	Nor is it beyond the sea , so that you have to ask , ‘ Who will cross the sea to get it and proclaim it to us so that we may obey it ? ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	14	No , the word is very near you ; it is in your mouth and in your heart so that you may obey it .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	15	See , I set before you today life and prosperity , death and destruction .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	16	For I command you today to love the Lord your God , to walk in obedience to him , and to keep his commands , decrees and laws ; then you will live and increase , and the Lord your God will bless you in the land you are entering to possess .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	17	But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient , and if you are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	18	I declare to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed . You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	19	This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death , blessings and curses . Now choose life , so that you and your children may live
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	30	20	and that you may love the Lord your God , listen to his voice , and hold fast to him . For the Lord is your life , and he will give you many years in the land he swore to give to your fathers , Abraham , Isaac and Jacob .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	31	Then Moses went out and spoke these words to all Israel :
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	2	‘ I am now a hundred and twenty years old and I am no longer able to lead you . The Lord has said to me , “ You shall not cross the Jordan. ”
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	3	The Lord your God himself will cross over ahead of you . He will destroy these nations before you , and you will take possession of their land . Joshua also will cross over ahead of you , as the Lord said .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	4	And the Lord will do to them what he did to Sihon and Og , the kings of the Amorites , whom he destroyed along with their land .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	5	The Lord will deliver them to you , and you must do to them all that I have commanded you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	6	Be strong and courageous . Do not be afraid or terrified because of them , for the Lord your God goes with you ; he will never leave you nor forsake you. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	7	Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel , ‘ Be strong and courageous , for you must go with this people into the land that the Lord swore to their ancestors to give them , and you must divide it among them as their inheritance .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	8	The Lord himself goes before you and will be with you ; he will never leave you nor forsake you . Do not be afraid ; do not be discouraged. ’ The reading of the law
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	9	So Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the Levitical priests , who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord , and to all the elders of Israel .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	10	Then Moses commanded them : ‘ At the end of every seven years , in the year for cancelling debts , during the Festival of Tabernacles ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	11	when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God at the place he will choose , you shall read this law before them in their hearing .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	12	Assemble the people – men , women and children , and the foreigners residing in your towns – so that they can listen and learn to fear the Lord your God and follow carefully all the words of this law .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	13	Their children , who do not know this law , must hear it and learn to fear the Lord your God as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess. ’ Israel ’ s rebellion predicted
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	14	The Lord said to Moses , ‘ Now the day of your death is near . Call Joshua and present yourselves at the tent of meeting , where I will commission him. ’ So Moses and Joshua came and presented themselves at the tent of meeting .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	15	Then the Lord appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud , and the cloud stood over the entrance to the tent .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	16	And the Lord said to Moses : ‘ You are going to rest with your ancestors , and these people will soon prostitute themselves to the foreign gods of the land they are entering . They will forsake me and break the covenant I made with them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	17	And in that day I will become angry with them and forsake them ; I will hide my face from them , and they will be destroyed . Many disasters and calamities will come on them , and in that day they will ask , “ Have not these disasters come on us because our God is not with us ? ”
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	18	And I will certainly hide my face in that day because of all their wickedness in turning to other gods .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	19	‘ Now write down this song and teach it to the Israelites and make them sing it , so that it may be a witness for me against them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	20	When I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey , the land I promised on oath to their ancestors , and when they eat their fill and thrive , they will turn to other gods and worship them , rejecting me and breaking my covenant .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	21	And when many disasters and calamities come on them , this song will testify against them , because it will not be forgotten by their descendants . I know what they are disposed to do , even before I bring them into the land I promised them on oath. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	22	So Moses wrote down this song that day and taught it to the Israelites .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	23	The Lord gave this command to Joshua son of Nun : ‘ Be strong and courageous , for you will bring the Israelites into the land I promised them on oath , and I myself will be with you. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	24	After Moses finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning to end ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	25	he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord :
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	26	‘ Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God . There it will remain as a witness against you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	27	For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are . If you have been rebellious against the Lord while I am still alive and with you , how much more will you rebel after I die !
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	28	Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officials , so that I can speak these words in their hearing and call the heavens and the earth to testify against them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	31	29	For I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the way I have commanded you . In days to come , disaster will fall on you because you will do evil in the sight of the Lord and arouse his anger by what your hands have made. ’ The song of Moses

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	32	Their vine comes from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah . Their grapes are filled with poison , and their clusters with bitterness .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	2	Let my teaching fall like rain and my words descend like dew , like showers on new grass , like abundant rain on tender plants .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	3	I will proclaim the name of the Lord . Oh , praise the greatness of our God !
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	4	He is the Rock , his works are perfect , and all his ways are just . A faithful God who does no wrong , upright and just is he .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	5	They are corrupt and not his children ; to their shame they are a warped and crooked generation .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	6	Is this the way you repay the Lord , you foolish and unwise people ? Is he not your Father , your Creator , [ a ] who made you and formed you ?
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	7	Remember the days of old ; consider the generations long past . Ask your father and he will tell you , your elders , and they will explain to you .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	8	When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance , when he divided all mankind , he set up boundaries for the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel . [ b ]
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	9	For the Lord ’ s portion is his people , Jacob his allotted inheritance .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	10	In a desert land he found him , in a barren and howling waste . He shielded him and cared for him ; he guarded him as the apple of his eye ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	11	like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young , that spreads its wings to catch them and carries them on its pinions .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	12	The Lord alone led him ; no foreign god was with him .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	13	He made him ride on the heights of the land and fed him with the fruit of the fields . He nourished him with honey from the rock , and with oil from the flinty crag ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	14	with curds and milk from herd and flock and with fattened lambs and goats , with choice rams of Bashan and the finest grains of wheat . You drank the foaming blood of the grape .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	15	Jeshurun [ c ] grew fat and kicked ; filled with food , they became heavy and sleek . They abandoned the God who made them and rejected the Rock their Saviour .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	16	They made him jealous with their foreign gods and angered him with their detestable idols .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	17	They sacrificed to false gods , which are not God – gods they had not known , gods that recently appeared , gods your ancestors did not fear .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	18	You deserted the Rock , who fathered you ; you forgot the God who gave you birth .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	19	The Lord saw this and rejected them because he was angered by his sons and daughters .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	20	‘ I will hide my face from them , ’ he said , ‘ and see what their end will be ; for they are a perverse generation , children who are unfaithful .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	21	They made me jealous by what is no god and angered me with their worthless idols . I will make them envious by those who are not a people ; I will make them angry by a nation that has no understanding .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	22	For a fire will be kindled by my wrath , one that burns down to the realm of the dead below . It will devour the earth and its harvests and set on fire the foundations of the mountains .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	23	‘ I will heap calamities on them and expend my arrows against them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	24	I will send wasting famine against them , consuming pestilence and deadly plague ; I will send against them the fangs of wild beasts , the venom of vipers that glide in the dust .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	25	In the street the sword will make them childless ; in their homes terror will reign . The young men and young women will perish , the infants and those with grey hair .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	26	I said I would scatter them and erase their name from human memory ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	27	but I dreaded the taunt of the enemy , lest the adversary misunderstand and say , “ Our hand has triumphed ; the Lord has not done all this. ” ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	28	They are a nation without sense , there is no discernment in them .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	29	If only they were wise and would understand this and discern what their end will be !
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	30	How could one man chase a thousand , or two put ten thousand to flight , unless their Rock had sold them , unless the Lord had given them up ?
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	31	For their rock is not like our Rock , as even our enemies concede .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	33	Their wine is the venom of serpents , the deadly poison of cobras .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	34	‘ Have I not kept this in reserve and sealed it in my vaults ?
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	35	It is mine to avenge ; I will repay . In due time their foot will slip ; their day of disaster is near and their doom rushes upon them. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	36	The Lord will vindicate his people and relent concerning his servants when he sees their strength is gone and no one is left , slave or free . [ d ]
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	37	He will say : ‘ Now where are their gods , the rock they took refuge in ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	38	the gods who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings ? Let them rise up to help you ! Let them give you shelter !
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	39	‘ See now that I myself am he ! There is no god besides me . I put to death and I bring to life , I have wounded and I will heal , and no one can deliver out of my hand .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	40	I lift my hand to heaven and solemnly swear : as surely as I live for ever ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	41	when I sharpen my flashing sword and my hand grasps it in judgment , I will take vengeance on my adversaries and repay those who hate me .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	42	I will make my arrows drunk with blood , while my sword devours flesh : the blood of the slain and the captives , the heads of the enemy leaders. ’
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	43	Rejoice , you nations , with his people , [ e ] [ f ] for he will avenge the blood of his servants ; he will take vengeance on his enemies and make atonement for his land and people .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	44	Moses came with Joshua [ g ] son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	45	When Moses had finished reciting all these words to all Israel ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	46	he said to them , ‘ Take to heart all the words I have solemnly declared to you this day , so that you may command your children to obey carefully all the words of this law .
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	47	They are not just idle words for you – they are your life . By them you will live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess. ’ Moses to die on Mount Nebo
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	48	On that same day the Lord told Moses ,
NIVUK	Deuteronomy	32	49	‘ Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount Nebo in Moab , opposite Jericho , and view Canaan , the land I am giving the Israelites as their own possession .

NIVUK	Deuteronomy	34	34	Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah , opposite Jericho . There the Lord showed him the whole land – from Gilead to Dan ,

NIVUK	Joshua	1	1	After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord , the Lord said to Joshua son of Nun , Moses ’ assistant :
NIVUK	Joshua	1	2	‘ Moses my servant is dead . Now then , you and all these people , get ready to cross the River Jordan into the land I am about to give to them – to the Israelites .
NIVUK	Joshua	1	3	I will give you every place where you set your foot , as I promised Moses .
NIVUK	Joshua	1	4	Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon , and from the great river , the Euphrates – all the Hittite country – to the Mediterranean Sea in the west .
NIVUK	Joshua	1	5	No one will be able to stand against you all the days of your life . As I was with Moses , so I will be with you ; I will never leave you nor forsake you .
NIVUK	Joshua	1	6	Be strong and courageous , because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors to give them .
NIVUK	Joshua	1	7	‘ Be strong and very courageous . Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you ; do not turn from it to the right or to the left , that you may be successful wherever you go .
NIVUK	Joshua	1	8	Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips ; meditate on it day and night , so that you may be careful to do everything written in it . Then you will be prosperous and successful .
NIVUK	Joshua	1	9	Have I not commanded you ? Be strong and courageous . Do not be afraid ; do not be discouraged , for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	1	10	So Joshua ordered the officers of the people :
NIVUK	Joshua	1	11	‘ Go through the camp and tell the people , “ Get your provisions ready . Three days from now you will cross the Jordan here to go in and take possession of the land the Lord your God is giving you for your own. ” ’
NIVUK	Joshua	1	12	But to the Reubenites , the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh , Joshua said ,
NIVUK	Joshua	1	13	‘ Remember the command that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you after he said , “ The Lord your God will give you rest by giving you this land. ”
NIVUK	Joshua	1	14	Your wives , your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan , but all your fighting men , ready for battle , must cross over ahead of your fellow Israelites . You are to help them
NIVUK	Joshua	1	15	until the Lord gives them rest , as he has done for you , and until they too have taken possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving them . After that , you may go back and occupy your own land , which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you east of the Jordan towards the sunrise. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	1	16	Then they answered Joshua , ‘ Whatever you have commanded us we will do , and wherever you send us we will go .
NIVUK	Joshua	1	17	Just as we fully obeyed Moses , so we will obey you . Only may the Lord your God be with you as he was with Moses .

NIVUK	Joshua	2	2	The king of Jericho was told , ‘ Look , some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	2	3	So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab : ‘ Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house , because they have come to spy out the whole land. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	2	4	But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them . She said , ‘ Yes , the men came to me , but I did not know where they had come from .
NIVUK	Joshua	2	5	At dusk , when it was time to close the city gate , they left . I don ’ t know which way they went . Go after them quickly . You may catch up with them. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	2	6	( But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof . )
NIVUK	Joshua	2	7	So the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan , and as soon as the pursuers had gone out , the gate was shut .
NIVUK	Joshua	2	8	Before the spies lay down for the night , she went up on the roof
NIVUK	Joshua	2	9	and said to them , ‘ I know that the Lord has given this land to you and that a great fear of you has fallen on us , so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you .
NIVUK	Joshua	2	10	We have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea [ a ] for you when you came out of Egypt , and what you did to Sihon and Og , the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan , whom you completely destroyed . [ b ]
NIVUK	Joshua	2	11	When we heard of it , our hearts sank [ c ] and everyone ’ s courage failed because of you , for the Lord your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below .
NIVUK	Joshua	2	12	‘ Now then , please swear to me by the Lord that you will show kindness to my family , because I have shown kindness to you . Give me a sure sign
NIVUK	Joshua	2	13	that you will spare the lives of my father and mother , my brothers and sisters , and all who belong to them – and that you will save us from death. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	2	14	‘ Our lives for your lives ! ’ the men assured her . ‘ If you don ’ t tell what we are doing , we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the Lord gives us the land. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	2	15	So she let them down by a rope through the window , for the house she lived in was part of the city wall .
NIVUK	Joshua	2	16	She said to them , ‘ Go to the hills so that the pursuers will not find you . Hide yourselves there for three days until they return , and then go on your way. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	2	17	Now the men had said to her , ‘ This oath you made us swear will not be binding on us
NIVUK	Joshua	2	18	unless , when we enter the land , you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down , and unless you have brought your father and mother , your brothers and all your family into your house .
NIVUK	Joshua	2	19	If any of them go outside your house into the street , their blood will be on their own heads ; we will not be responsible . As for those who are in the house with you , their blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on them .
NIVUK	Joshua	2	20	But if you tell what we are doing , we will be released from the oath you made us swear. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	2	21	‘ Agreed , ’ she replied . ‘ Let it be as you say. ’ So she sent them away , and they departed . And she tied the scarlet cord in the window .
NIVUK	Joshua	2	22	When they left , they went into the hills and stayed there three days , until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them .
NIVUK	Joshua	2	23	Then the two men started back . They went down out of the hills , forded the river and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him everything that had happened to them .
NIVUK	Joshua	2	24	They said to Joshua , ‘ The Lord has surely given the whole land into our hands ; all the people are melting in fear because of us. ’ Footnotes - Joshua 2:10 Or the Sea of Reeds - Joshua 2:10 The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the Lord , often by totally destroying them . - Joshua 2:11 Hebrew melted in fear .

NIVUK	Joshua	3	3	giving orders to the people : ‘ When you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God , and the Levitical priests carrying it , you are to move out from your positions and follow it .
NIVUK	Joshua	3	2	After three days the officers went throughout the camp ,
NIVUK	Joshua	3	4	Then you will know which way to go , since you have never been this way before . But keep a distance of about two thousand cubits [ a ] between you and the ark ; do not go near it. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	3	5	Joshua told the people , ‘ Consecrate yourselves , for tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things among you. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	3	6	Joshua said to the priests , ‘ Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people. ’ So they took it up and went ahead of them .
NIVUK	Joshua	3	7	And the Lord said to Joshua , ‘ Today I will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel , so that they may know that I am with you as I was with Moses .
NIVUK	Joshua	3	8	Tell the priests who carry the ark of the covenant : “ When you reach the edge of the Jordan ’ s waters , go and stand in the river. ” ’
NIVUK	Joshua	3	9	Joshua said to the Israelites , ‘ Come here and listen to the words of the Lord your God .
NIVUK	Joshua	3	10	This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that he will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites , Hittites , Hivites , Perizzites , Girgashites , Amorites and Jebusites .
NIVUK	Joshua	3	11	See , the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go into the Jordan ahead of you .
NIVUK	Joshua	3	12	Now then , choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel , one from each tribe .
NIVUK	Joshua	3	13	And as soon as the priests who carry the ark of the Lord – the Lord of all the earth – set foot in the Jordan , its waters flowing downstream will be cut off and stand up in a heap. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	3	14	So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan , the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them .
NIVUK	Joshua	3	15	Now the Jordan is in flood all during harvest . Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water ’ s edge ,
NIVUK	Joshua	3	16	the water from upstream stopped flowing . It piled up in a heap a great distance away , at a town called Adam in the vicinity of Zarethan , while the water flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah ( that is , the Dead Sea ) was completely cut off . So the people crossed over opposite Jericho .
NIVUK	Joshua	3	17	The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord stopped in the middle of the Jordan and stood on dry ground , while all Israel passed by until the whole nation had completed the crossing on dry ground . Footnotes - Joshua 3:4 That is , about

NIVUK	Joshua	4	4	So Joshua called together the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites , one from each tribe ,
NIVUK	Joshua	4	2	‘ Choose twelve men from among the people , one from each tribe ,
NIVUK	Joshua	4	3	and tell them to take up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan , from right where the priests are standing , and carry them over with you and put them down at the place where you stay tonight. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	4	5	and said to them , ‘ Go over before the ark of the Lord your God into the middle of the Jordan . Each of you is to take up a stone on his shoulder , according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites ,
NIVUK	Joshua	4	6	to serve as a sign among you . In the future , when your children ask you , “ What do these stones mean ? ”
NIVUK	Joshua	4	7	tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord . When it crossed the Jordan , the waters of the Jordan were cut off . These stones are to be a memorial to the people of Israel for ever. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	4	8	So the Israelites did as Joshua commanded them . They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan , according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites , as the Lord had told Joshua ; and they carried them over with them to their camp , where they put them down .
NIVUK	Joshua	4	9	Joshua set up the twelve stones that had been [ a ] in the middle of the Jordan at the spot where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant had stood . And they are there to this day .
NIVUK	Joshua	4	10	Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything the Lord had commanded Joshua was done by the people , just as Moses had directed Joshua . The people hurried over ,
NIVUK	Joshua	4	11	and as soon as all of them had crossed , the ark of the Lord and the priests came to the other side while the people watched .
NIVUK	Joshua	4	12	The men of Reuben , Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over , ready for battle , in front of the Israelites , as Moses had directed them .
NIVUK	Joshua	4	13	About forty thousand armed for battle crossed over before the Lord to the plains of Jericho for war .
NIVUK	Joshua	4	14	That day the Lord exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel ; and they stood in awe of him all the days of his life , just as they had stood in awe of Moses .
NIVUK	Joshua	4	15	Then the Lord said to Joshua ,
NIVUK	Joshua	4	16	‘ Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant law to come up out of the Jordan. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	4	17	So Joshua commanded the priests , ‘ Come up out of the Jordan. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	4	18	And the priests came up out of the river carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord . No sooner had they set their feet on the dry ground than the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and ran in flood as before .
NIVUK	Joshua	4	19	On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho .
NIVUK	Joshua	4	20	And Joshua set up at Gilgal the twelve stones they had taken out of the Jordan .
NIVUK	Joshua	4	21	He said to the Israelites , ‘ In the future when your descendants ask their parents , “ What do these stones mean ? ”
NIVUK	Joshua	4	22	tell them , “ Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground. ”
NIVUK	Joshua	4	23	For the Lord your God dried up the Jordan before you until you had crossed over . The Lord your God did to the Jordan what he had done to the Red Sea [ b ] when he dried it up before us until we had crossed over .
NIVUK	Joshua	4	24	He did this so that all the peoples of the earth might know that the hand of the Lord is powerful and so that you might always fear the Lord your God. ’ Footnotes - Joshua 4:9 Or Joshua also set up twelve stones - Joshua 4:23 Or the Sea of Reeds Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Joshua	5	5	All the people that came out had been circumcised , but all the people born in the wilderness during the journey from Egypt had not .
NIVUK	Joshua	5	2	At that time the Lord said to Joshua , ‘ Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites again. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	5	3	So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth . [ b ]
NIVUK	Joshua	5	4	Now this is why he did so : all those who came out of Egypt – all the men of military age – died in the wilderness on the way after leaving Egypt .
NIVUK	Joshua	5	6	The Israelites had moved about in the wilderness for forty years until all the men who were of military age when they left Egypt had died , since they had not obeyed the Lord . For the Lord had sworn to them that they would not see the land that he had solemnly promised their ancestors to give us , a land flowing with milk and honey .
NIVUK	Joshua	5	7	So he raised up their sons in their place , and these were the ones Joshua circumcised . They were still uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised on the way .
NIVUK	Joshua	5	8	And after the whole nation had been circumcised , they remained where they were in camp until they were healed .
NIVUK	Joshua	5	9	Then the Lord said to Joshua , ‘ Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you. ’ So the place has been called Gilgal [ c ] to this day .
NIVUK	Joshua	5	10	On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month , while camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho , the Israelites celebrated the Passover .
NIVUK	Joshua	5	11	The day after the Passover , that very day , they ate some of the produce of the land : unleavened bread and roasted grain .

NIVUK	Joshua	6	7	And he ordered the army , ‘ Advance ! March round the city , with an armed guard going ahead of the ark of the Lord. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	6	8	When Joshua had spoken to the people , the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets before the Lord went forwards , blowing their trumpets , and the ark of the Lord ’ s covenant followed them .
NIVUK	Joshua	6	9	The armed guard marched ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets , and the rear guard followed the ark . All this time the trumpets were sounding .
NIVUK	Joshua	6	10	But Joshua had commanded the army , ‘ Do not give a war cry , do not raise your voices , do not say a word until the day I tell you to shout . Then shout ! ’
NIVUK	Joshua	6	11	So he had the ark of the Lord carried round the city , circling it once . Then the army returned to camp and spent the night there .

NIVUK	Joshua	6	13	The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets went forwards , marching before the ark of the Lord and blowing the trumpets . The armed men went ahead of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the Lord , while the trumpets kept sounding .

NIVUK	Joshua	6	24	Then they burned the whole city and everything in it , but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the Lord ’ s house .
NIVUK	Joshua	6	25	But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute , with her family and all who belonged to her , because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho – and she lives among the Israelites to this day .
NIVUK	Joshua	6	26	At that time Joshua pronounced this solemn oath : ‘ Cursed before the Lord is the one who undertakes to rebuild this city , Jericho : ‘ At the cost of his firstborn son he will lay its foundations ; at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	6	27	So the Lord was with Joshua , and his fame spread throughout the land . Footnotes - Joshua 6:17 The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the Lord , often by totally destroying them ; also in verses

NIVUK	Joshua	7	7	And Joshua said , ‘ Alas , Sovereign Lord , why did you ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us ? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan !
NIVUK	Joshua	7	2	Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai , which is near Beth Aven to the east of Bethel , and told them , ‘ Go up and spy out the region. ’ So the men went up and spied out Ai .
NIVUK	Joshua	7	3	When they returned to Joshua , they said , ‘ Not all the army will have to go up against Ai . Send two or three thousand men to take it and do not weary the whole army , for only a few people live there. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	7	4	So about three thousand went up ; but they were routed by the men of Ai ,
NIVUK	Joshua	7	5	who killed about thirty-six of them . They chased the Israelites from the city gate as far as the stone quarries and struck them down on the slopes . At this the hearts of the people melted in fear and became like water .
NIVUK	Joshua	7	6	Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell face down to the ground before the ark of the Lord , remaining there till evening . The elders of Israel did the same , and sprinkled dust on their heads .
NIVUK	Joshua	7	8	Pardon your servant , Lord . What can I say , now that Israel has been routed by its enemies ?
NIVUK	Joshua	7	9	The Canaanites and the other people of the country will hear about this and they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth . What then will you do for your own great name ? ’
NIVUK	Joshua	7	10	The Lord said to Joshua , ‘ Stand up ! What are you doing down on your face ?
NIVUK	Joshua	7	11	,
NIVUK	Joshua	7	12	,
NIVUK	Joshua	7	13	and
NIVUK	Joshua	7	14	‘ “ In the morning , present yourselves tribe by tribe . The tribe that the Lord chooses shall come forward clan by clan ; the clan that the Lord chooses shall come forward family by family ; and the family that the Lord chooses shall come forward man by man .

NIVUK	Joshua	7	19	Then Joshua said to Achan , ‘ My son , give glory to the Lord , the God of Israel , and honour him . Tell me what you have done ; do not hide it from me. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	7	20	Achan replied , ‘ It is true ! I have sinned against the Lord , the God of Israel . This is what I have done :
NIVUK	Joshua	7	21	when I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia , [ c ] two hundred shekels [ d ] of silver and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels , [ e ] I coveted them and took them . They are hidden in the ground inside my tent , with the silver underneath. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	7	22	So Joshua sent messengers , and they ran to the tent , and there it was , hidden in his tent , with the silver underneath .
NIVUK	Joshua	7	23	They took the things from the tent , brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and spread them out before the Lord .
NIVUK	Joshua	7	24	Then Joshua , together with all Israel , took Achan son of Zerah , the silver , the robe , the gold bar , his sons and daughters , his cattle , donkeys and sheep , his tent and all that he had , to the Valley of Achor .
NIVUK	Joshua	7	25	Joshua said , ‘ Why have you brought this trouble on us ? The Lord will bring trouble on you today. ’ Then all Israel stoned him , and after they had stoned the rest , they burned them .
NIVUK	Joshua	7	26	Over Achan they heaped up a large pile of rocks , which remains to this day . Then the Lord turned from his fierce anger . Therefore that place has been called the Valley of Achor [ f ] ever since .

NIVUK	Joshua	8	8	When you have taken the city , set it on fire . Do what the Lord has commanded . See to it ; you have my orders. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	8	2	You shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king , except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves . Set an ambush behind the city. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	8	3	So Joshua and the whole army moved out to attack Ai . He chose thirty thousand of his best fighting men and sent them out at night
NIVUK	Joshua	8	4	with these orders : ‘ Listen carefully . You are to set an ambush behind the city . Don ’ t go very far from it . All of you be on the alert .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	5	I and all those with me will advance on the city , and when the men come out against us , as they did before , we will flee from them .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	6	They will pursue us until we have lured them away from the city , for they will say , “ They are running away from us as they did before. ” So when we flee from them ,
NIVUK	Joshua	8	7	you are to rise up from ambush and take the city . The Lord your God will give it into your hand .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	9	Then Joshua sent them off , and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai , to the west of Ai – but Joshua spent that night with the people .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	10	Early the next morning Joshua mustered his army , and he and the leaders of Israel marched before them to Ai .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	11	The entire force that was with him marched up and approached the city and arrived in front of it . They set up camp north of Ai , with the valley between them and the city .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	12	Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai , to the west of the city .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	13	So the soldiers took up their positions – with the main camp to the north of the city and the ambush to the west of it . That night Joshua went into the valley .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	14	When the king of Ai saw this , he and all the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the Arabah . But he did not know that an ambush had been set against him behind the city .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	15	Joshua and all Israel let themselves be driven back before them , and they fled towards the wilderness .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	16	All the men of Ai were called to pursue them , and they pursued Joshua and were lured away from the city .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	17	Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who did not go after Israel . They left the city open and went in pursuit of Israel .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	18	Then the Lord said to Joshua , ‘ Hold out towards Ai the javelin that is in your hand , for into your hand I will deliver the city. ’ So Joshua held out towards the city the javelin that was in his hand .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	19	As soon as he did this , the men in the ambush rose quickly from their position and rushed forward . They entered the city and captured it and quickly set it on fire .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	20	The men of Ai looked back and saw the smoke of the city rising up into the sky , but they had no chance to escape in any direction ; the Israelites who had been fleeing towards the wilderness had turned back against their pursuers .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	21	For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that smoke was going up from the city , they turned round and attacked the men of Ai .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	22	Those in the ambush also came out of the city against them , so that they were caught in the middle , with Israelites on both sides . Israel cut them down , leaving them neither survivors nor fugitives .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	23	But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	24	When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai in the fields and in the wilderness where they had chased them , and when every one of them had been put to the sword , all the Israelites returned to Ai and killed those who were in it .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	25	Twelve thousand men and women fell that day – all the people of Ai .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	26	For Joshua did not draw back the hand that held out his javelin until he had destroyed [ a ] all who lived in Ai .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	27	But Israel did carry off for themselves the livestock and plunder of this city , as the Lord had instructed Joshua .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	28	So Joshua burned Ai [ b ] and made it a permanent heap of ruins , a desolate place to this day .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	29	He impaled the body of the king of Ai on a pole and left it there until evening . At sunset , Joshua ordered them to take the body from the pole and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate . And they raised a large pile of rocks over it , which remains to this day . The covenant renewed at Mount Ebal
NIVUK	Joshua	8	30	Then Joshua built on Mount Ebal an altar to the Lord , the God of Israel ,
NIVUK	Joshua	8	31	as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded the Israelites . He built it according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses – an altar of uncut stones , on which no iron tool had been used . On it they offered to the Lord burnt offerings and sacrificed fellowship offerings .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	32	There , in the presence of the Israelites , Joshua wrote on stones a copy of the law of Moses .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	33	All the Israelites , with their elders , officials and judges , were standing on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the Lord , facing the Levitical priests who carried it . Both the foreigners living among them and the native-born were there . Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal , as Moses the servant of the Lord had formerly commanded when he gave instructions to bless the people of Israel .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	34	Afterwards , Joshua read all the words of the law – the blessings and the curses – just as it is written in the Book of the Law .
NIVUK	Joshua	8	35	There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read to the whole assembly of Israel , including the women and children , and the foreigners who lived among them .

NIVUK	Joshua	9	9	They answered : ‘ Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the fame of the Lord your God . For we have heard reports of him : all that he did in Egypt ,
NIVUK	Joshua	9	2	they came together to wage war against Joshua and Israel .
NIVUK	Joshua	9	3	However , when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai ,
NIVUK	Joshua	9	4	they resorted to a ruse : they went as a delegation whose donkeys were loaded [ a ] with worn-out sacks and old wineskins , cracked and mended .
NIVUK	Joshua	9	5	They put worn and patched sandals on their feet and wore old clothes . All the bread of their food supply was dry and mouldy .
NIVUK	Joshua	9	6	Then they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the Israelites , ‘ We have come from a distant country ; make a treaty with us. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	9	7	The Israelites said to the Hivites , ‘ But perhaps you live near us , so how can we make a treaty with you ? ’
NIVUK	Joshua	9	8	‘ We are your servants , ’ they said to Joshua . But Joshua asked , ‘ Who are you and where do you come from ? ’
NIVUK	Joshua	9	10	and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan – Sihon king of Heshbon , and Og king of Bashan , who reigned in Ashtaroth .
NIVUK	Joshua	9	11	And our elders and all those living in our country said to us , “ Take provisions for your journey ; go and meet them and say to them , ‘ We are your servants ; make a treaty with us. ’ ”
NIVUK	Joshua	9	12	This bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you . But now see how dry and mouldy it is .
NIVUK	Joshua	9	13	And these wineskins that we filled were new , but see how cracked they are . And our clothes and sandals are worn out by the very long journey. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	9	14	The Israelites sampled their provisions but did not enquire of the Lord .
NIVUK	Joshua	9	15	Then Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live , and the leaders of the assembly ratified it by oath .
NIVUK	Joshua	9	16	Three days after they made the treaty with the Gibeonites , the Israelites heard that they were neighbours , living near them .
NIVUK	Joshua	9	17	So the Israelites set out and on the third day came to their cities : Gibeon , Kephirah , Beeroth and Kiriath Jearim .
NIVUK	Joshua	9	18	But the Israelites did not attack them , because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath to them by the Lord , the God of Israel . The whole assembly grumbled against the leaders ,
NIVUK	Joshua	9	19	but all the leaders answered , ‘ We have given them our oath by the Lord , the God of Israel , and we can not touch them now .
NIVUK	Joshua	9	20	This is what we will do to them : we will let them live , so that God ’ s wrath will not fall on us for breaking the oath we swore to them. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	9	21	They continued , ‘ Let them live , but let them be woodcutters and water-carriers in the service of the whole assembly. ’ So the leaders ’ promise to them was kept .
NIVUK	Joshua	9	22	Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said , ‘ Why did you deceive us by saying , “ We live a long way from you , ” while actually you live near us ?
NIVUK	Joshua	9	23	You are now under a curse : you will never be released from service as woodcutters and water-carriers for the house of my God. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	9	24	They answered Joshua , ‘ Your servants were clearly told how the Lord your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you the whole land and to wipe out all its inhabitants from before you . So we feared for our lives because of you , and that is why we did this .
NIVUK	Joshua	9	25	We are now in your hands . Do to us whatever seems good and right to you. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	9	26	So Joshua saved them from the Israelites , and they did not kill them .
NIVUK	Joshua	9	27	That day he made the Gibeonites woodcutters and water-carriers for the assembly , to provide for the needs of the altar of the Lord at the place the Lord would choose . And that is what they are to this day .

NIVUK	Joshua	10	10	The Lord threw them into confusion before Israel , so Joshua and the Israelites defeated them completely at Gibeon . Israel pursued them along the road going up to Beth Horon and cut them down all the way to Azekah and Makkedah .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	2	He and his people were very much alarmed at this , because Gibeon was an important city , like one of the royal cities ; it was larger than Ai , and all its men were good fighters .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	3	So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem appealed to Hoham king of Hebron , Piram king of Jarmuth , Japhia king of Lachish and Debir king of Eglon .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	4	‘ Come up and help me attack Gibeon , ’ he said , ‘ because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	10	5	Then the five kings of the Amorites – the kings of Jerusalem , Hebron , Jarmuth , Lachish and Eglon – joined forces . They moved up with all their troops and took up positions against Gibeon and attacked it .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	6	The Gibeonites then sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal : ‘ Do not abandon your servants . Come up to us quickly and save us ! Help us , because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	10	7	So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his entire army , including all the best fighting men .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	8	The Lord said to Joshua , ‘ Do not be afraid of them ; I have given them into your hand . Not one of them will be able to withstand you. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	10	9	After an all-night march from Gilgal , Joshua took them by surprise .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	11	As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah , the Lord hurled large hailstones down on them , and more of them died from the hail than were killed by the swords of the Israelites .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	12	On the day the Lord gave the Amorites over to Israel , Joshua said to the Lord in the presence of Israel : ‘ Sun , stand still over Gibeon , and you , moon , over the Valley of Aijalon. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	10	13	So the sun stood still , and the moon stopped , till the nation avenged itself on [ b ] its enemies , as it is written in the Book of Jashar . The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	14	There has never been a day like it before or since , a day when the Lord listened to a human being . Surely the Lord was fighting for Israel !
NIVUK	Joshua	10	15	Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal . Five Amorite kings killed
NIVUK	Joshua	10	16	Now the five kings had fled and hidden in the cave at Makkedah .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	17	When Joshua was told that the five kings had been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah ,
NIVUK	Joshua	10	18	he said , ‘ Roll large rocks up to the mouth of the cave , and post some men there to guard it .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	19	But don ’ t stop ; pursue your enemies ! Attack them from the rear and don ’ t let them reach their cities , for the Lord your God has given them into your hand. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	10	20	So Joshua and the Israelites defeated them completely , but a few survivors managed to reach their fortified cities .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	21	The whole army then returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah , and no one uttered a word against the Israelites .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	22	Joshua said , ‘ Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	10	23	So they brought the five kings out of the cave – the kings of Jerusalem , Hebron , Jarmuth , Lachish and Eglon .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	24	When they had brought these kings to Joshua , he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the army commanders who had come with him , ‘ Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings. ’ So they came forward and placed their feet on their necks .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	25	Joshua said to them , ‘ Do not be afraid ; do not be discouraged . Be strong and courageous . This is what the Lord will do to all the enemies you are going to fight. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	10	26	Then Joshua put the kings to death and exposed their bodies on five poles , and they were left hanging on the poles until evening .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	27	At sunset Joshua gave the order and they took them down from the poles and threw them into the cave where they had been hiding . At the mouth of the cave they placed large rocks , which are there to this day . Southern cities conquered
NIVUK	Joshua	10	28	,
NIVUK	Joshua	10	29	Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	30	The Lord also gave that city and its king into Israel ’ s hand . The city and everyone in it Joshua put to the sword . He left no survivors there . And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	31	Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish ; he took up positions against it and attacked it .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	32	The Lord gave Lachish into Israel ’ s hands , and Joshua took it on the second day . The city and everyone in it he put to the sword , just as he had done to Libnah .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	33	Meanwhile , Horam king of Gezer had come up to help Lachish , but Joshua defeated him and his army – until no survivors were left .
NIVUK	Joshua	10	34	Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Lachish to Eglon ; they took up positions against it and attacked it .

NIVUK	Joshua	11	4	They came out with all their troops and a large number of horses and chariots – a huge army , as numerous as the sand on the seashore .
NIVUK	Joshua	11	5	All these kings joined forces and made camp together at the Waters of Merom to fight against Israel .
NIVUK	Joshua	11	6	The Lord said to Joshua , ‘ Do not be afraid of them , because by this time tomorrow I will hand all of them , slain , over to Israel . You are to hamstring their horses and burn their chariots. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	11	7	So Joshua and his whole army came against them suddenly at the Waters of Merom and attacked them ,
NIVUK	Joshua	11	8	and the Lord gave them into the hand of Israel . They defeated them and pursued them all the way to Greater Sidon , to Misrephoth Maim , and to the Valley of Mizpah on the east , until no survivors were left .
NIVUK	Joshua	11	9	Joshua did to them as the Lord had directed : he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots .

NIVUK	Joshua	14	7	I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh Barnea to explore the land . And I brought him back a report according to my convictions ,
NIVUK	Joshua	14	8	but my fellow Israelites who went up with me made the hearts of the people sink . [ a ] I , however , followed the Lord my God wholeheartedly .
NIVUK	Joshua	14	9	So on that day Moses swore to me , “ The land on which your feet have walked will be your inheritance and that of your children for ever , because you have followed the Lord my God wholeheartedly. ” [ b ]
NIVUK	Joshua	14	10	‘ Now then , just as the Lord promised , he has kept me alive for forty-five years since the time he said this to Moses , while Israel moved about in the wilderness . So here I am today , eighty-five years old !
NIVUK	Joshua	14	11	I am still as strong today as the day Moses sent me out ; I ’ m just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then .
NIVUK	Joshua	14	12	Now give me this hill country that the Lord promised me that day . You yourself heard then that the Anakites were there and their cities were large and fortified , but , the Lord helping me , I will drive them out just as he said. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	14	13	Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance .

NIVUK	Joshua	17	17	But Joshua said to the tribes of Joseph – to Ephraim and Manasseh – ‘ You are numerous and very powerful . You will have not only one portion of land allotted to you
NIVUK	Joshua	17	2	So this land was allotted to the rest of the people of Manasseh – the clans of Abiezer , Helek , Asriel , Shechem , Hepher and Shemida . These are the other male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph by their clans .
NIVUK	Joshua	17	3	Now Zelophehad son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Makir , the son of Manasseh , had no sons but only daughters , whose names were Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milkah and Tirzah .
NIVUK	Joshua	17	4	They went to Eleazar the priest , Joshua son of Nun , and the leaders and said , ‘ The Lord commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our relatives. ’ So Joshua gave them an inheritance along with the brothers of their father , according to the Lord ’ s command .
NIVUK	Joshua	17	5	Manasseh ’ s share consisted of ten tracts of land besides Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan ,
NIVUK	Joshua	17	6	because the daughters of the tribe of Manasseh received an inheritance among the sons . The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the descendants of Manasseh .
NIVUK	Joshua	17	7	The territory of Manasseh extended from Asher to Mikmethath east of Shechem . The boundary ran southward from there to include the people living at En Tappuah .
NIVUK	Joshua	17	8	( Manasseh had the land of Tappuah , but Tappuah itself , on the boundary of Manasseh , belonged to the Ephraimites . )
NIVUK	Joshua	17	9	Then the boundary continued south to the Kanah Ravine . There were towns belonging to Ephraim lying among the towns of Manasseh , but the boundary of Manasseh was the northern side of the ravine and ended at the Mediterranean Sea .
NIVUK	Joshua	17	10	On the south the land belonged to Ephraim , on the north to Manasseh . The territory of Manasseh reached the Mediterranean Sea and bordered Asher on the north and Issachar on the east .
NIVUK	Joshua	17	11	Within Issachar and Asher , Manasseh also had Beth Shan , Ibleam and the people of Dor , Endor , Taanach and Megiddo , together with their surrounding settlements ( the third in the list is Naphoth [ a ] ) .
NIVUK	Joshua	17	12	Yet the Manassites were not able to occupy these towns , for the Canaanites were determined to live in that region .
NIVUK	Joshua	17	13	However , when the Israelites grew stronger , they subjected the Canaanites to forced labour but did not drive them out completely .
NIVUK	Joshua	17	14	The people of Joseph said to Joshua , ‘ Why have you allotted us only one portion of land and one share for an inheritance ? We are a numerous people , and the Lord has blessed us abundantly. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	17	15	‘ If you are so numerous , ’ Joshua answered , ‘ and if the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you , go up into the forest and clear land for yourselves there in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaites. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	17	16	The people of Joseph replied , ‘ The hill country is not enough for us , and all the Canaanites who live in the plain have chariots fitted with iron , both those in Beth Shan and its settlements and those in the Valley of Jezreel. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	17	18	but the forested hill country as well .

NIVUK	Joshua	18	18	It continued to the northern slope of Beth Arabah [ a ] and on down into the Arabah .
NIVUK	Joshua	18	2	but there were still seven Israelite tribes who had not yet received their inheritance .
NIVUK	Joshua	18	3	So Joshua said to the Israelites : ‘ How long will you wait before you begin to take possession of the land that the Lord , the God of your ancestors , has given you ?
NIVUK	Joshua	18	4	Appoint three men from each tribe . I will send them out to make a survey of the land and to write a description of it , according to the inheritance of each . Then they will return to me .
NIVUK	Joshua	18	5	You are to divide the land into seven parts . Judah is to remain in its territory on the south and the tribes of Joseph in their territory on the north .
NIVUK	Joshua	18	6	After you have written descriptions of the seven parts of the land , bring them here to me and I will cast lots for you in the presence of the Lord our God .
NIVUK	Joshua	18	7	The Levites , however , do not get a portion among you , because the priestly service of the Lord is their inheritance . And Gad , Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan . Moses the servant of the Lord gave it to them. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	18	8	As the men started on their way to map out the land , Joshua instructed them , ‘ Go and make a survey of the land and write a description of it . Then return to me , and I will cast lots for you here at Shiloh in the presence of the Lord. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	18	9	So the men left and went through the land . They wrote its description on a scroll , town by town , in seven parts , and returned to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh .
NIVUK	Joshua	18	10	Joshua then cast lots for them in Shiloh in the presence of the Lord , and there he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their tribal divisions . Land allotted to Benjamin

NIVUK	Joshua	18	13	From there it crossed to the south slope of Luz ( that is , Bethel ) and went down to Ataroth Addar on the hill south of Lower Beth Horon .
NIVUK	Joshua	18	14	From the hill facing Beth Horon on the south the boundary turned south along the western side and came out at Kiriath Baal ( that is , Kiriath Jearim ) , a town of the people of Judah . This was the western side .
NIVUK	Joshua	18	15	The southern side began at the outskirts of Kiriath Jearim on the west , and the boundary came out at the spring of the waters of Nephtoah .
NIVUK	Joshua	18	16	The boundary went down to the foot of the hill facing the Valley of Ben Hinnom , north of the Valley of Rephaim . It continued down the Hinnom Valley along the southern slope of the Jebusite city and so to En Rogel .
NIVUK	Joshua	18	17	It then curved north , went to En Shemesh , continued to Geliloth , which faces the Pass of Adummim , and ran down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben .

NIVUK	Joshua	20	20	Then the Lord said to Joshua :
NIVUK	Joshua	20	2	‘ Tell the Israelites to designate the cities of refuge , as I instructed you through Moses ,
NIVUK	Joshua	20	3	so that anyone who kills a person accidentally and unintentionally may flee there and find protection from the avenger of blood .
NIVUK	Joshua	20	4	When they flee to one of these cities , they are to stand in the entrance of the city gate and state their case before the elders of that city . Then the elders are to admit the fugitive into their city and provide a place to live among them .
NIVUK	Joshua	20	5	If the avenger of blood comes in pursuit , the elders must not surrender the fugitive , because the fugitive killed their neighbour unintentionally and without malice aforethought .
NIVUK	Joshua	20	6	They are to stay in that city until they have stood trial before the assembly and until the death of the high priest who is serving at that time . Then they may go back to their own home in the town from which they fled. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	20	7	So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali , Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim , and Kiriath Arba ( that is , Hebron ) in the hill country of Judah .
NIVUK	Joshua	20	8	East of the Jordan ( on the other side from Jericho ) they designated Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau in the tribe of Reuben , Ramoth in Gilead in the tribe of Gad , and Golan in Bashan in the tribe of Manasseh .

NIVUK	Joshua	21	44	The Lord gave them rest on every side , just as he had sworn to their ancestors . Not one of their enemies withstood them ; the Lord gave all their enemies into their hands .

NIVUK	Joshua	22	22	‘ The Mighty One , God , the Lord ! The Mighty One , God , the Lord ! He knows ! And let Israel know ! If this has been in rebellion or disobedience to the Lord , do not spare us this day .
NIVUK	Joshua	22	2	and said to them , ‘ You have done all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded , and you have obeyed me in everything I commanded .
NIVUK	Joshua	22	3	For a long time now – to this very day – you have not deserted your fellow Israelites but have carried out the mission the Lord your God gave you .
NIVUK	Joshua	22	4	Now that the Lord your God has given them rest as he promised , return to your homes in the land that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on the other side of the Jordan .
NIVUK	Joshua	22	5	But be very careful to keep the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you : to love the Lord your God , to walk in obedience to him , to keep his commands , to hold fast to him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	22	6	Then Joshua blessed them and sent them away , and they went to their homes .
NIVUK	Joshua	22	7	( To the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given land in Bashan , and to the other half of the tribe Joshua gave land on the west side of the Jordan along with their fellow Israelites . ) When Joshua sent them home , he blessed them ,
NIVUK	Joshua	22	8	saying , ‘ Return to your homes with your great wealth – with large herds of livestock , with silver , gold , bronze and iron , and a great quantity of clothing – and divide the plunder from your enemies with your fellow Israelites. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	22	9	So the Reubenites , the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites at Shiloh in Canaan to return to Gilead , their own land , which they had acquired in accordance with the command of the Lord through Moses .
NIVUK	Joshua	22	10	When they came to Geliloth near the Jordan in the land of Canaan , the Reubenites , the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an imposing altar there by the Jordan .
NIVUK	Joshua	22	11	And when the Israelites heard that they had built the altar on the border of Canaan at Geliloth near the Jordan on the Israelite side ,
NIVUK	Joshua	22	12	the whole assembly of Israel gathered at Shiloh to go to war against them .
NIVUK	Joshua	22	13	So the Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar , the priest , to the land of Gilead – to Reuben , Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh .
NIVUK	Joshua	22	14	With him they sent ten of the chief men , one from each of the tribes of Israel , each the head of a family division among the Israelite clans .
NIVUK	Joshua	22	15	When they went to Gilead – to Reuben , Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh – they said to them :
NIVUK	Joshua	22	16	‘ The whole assembly of the Lord says : “ How could you break faith with the God of Israel like this ? How could you turn away from the Lord and build yourselves an altar in rebellion against him now ?
NIVUK	Joshua	22	17	Was not the sin of Peor enough for us ? Up to this very day we have not cleansed ourselves from that sin , even though a plague fell on the community of the Lord !
NIVUK	Joshua	22	18	And are you now turning away from the Lord ? ‘ “ If you rebel against the Lord today , tomorrow he will be angry with the whole community of Israel .
NIVUK	Joshua	22	19	If the land you possess is defiled , come over to the Lord ’ s land , where the Lord ’ s tabernacle stands , and share the land with us . But do not rebel against the Lord or against us by building an altar for yourselves , other than the altar of the Lord our God .
NIVUK	Joshua	22	20	When Achan son of Zerah was unfaithful in regard to the devoted things , [ a ] did not wrath come on the whole community of Israel ? He was not the only one who died for his sin. ” ’
NIVUK	Joshua	22	21	Then Reuben , Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh replied to the heads of the clans of Israel :
NIVUK	Joshua	22	23	If we have built our own altar to turn away from the Lord and to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings , or to sacrifice fellowship offerings on it , may the Lord himself call us to account .
NIVUK	Joshua	22	24	‘ No ! We did it for fear that some day your descendants might say to ours , “ What do you have to do with the Lord , the God of Israel ?
NIVUK	Joshua	22	25	The Lord has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you – you Reubenites and Gadites ! You have no share in the Lord. ” So your descendants might cause ours to stop fearing the Lord .
NIVUK	Joshua	22	26	‘ That is why we said , “ Let us get ready and build an altar – but not for burnt offerings or sacrifices. ”
NIVUK	Joshua	22	27	On the contrary , it is to be a witness between us and you and the generations that follow , that we will worship the Lord at his sanctuary with our burnt offerings , sacrifices and fellowship offerings . Then in the future your descendants will not be able to say to ours , “ You have no share in the Lord. ”
NIVUK	Joshua	22	28	‘ And we said , “ If they ever say this to us , or to our descendants , we will answer : look at the replica of the Lord ’ s altar , which our ancestors built , not for burnt offerings and sacrifices , but as a witness between us and you. ”
NIVUK	Joshua	22	29	‘ Far be it from us to rebel against the Lord and turn away from him today by building an altar for burnt offerings , grain offerings and sacrifices , other than the altar of the Lord our God that stands before his tabernacle. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	22	30	When Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the community – the heads of the clans of the Israelites – heard what Reuben , Gad and Manasseh had to say , they were pleased .
NIVUK	Joshua	22	31	And Phinehas son of Eleazar , the priest , said to Reuben , Gad and Manasseh , ‘ Today we know that the Lord is with us , because you have not been unfaithful to the Lord in this matter . Now you have rescued the Israelites from the Lord ’ s hand. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	22	32	Then Phinehas son of Eleazar , the priest , and the leaders returned to Canaan from their meeting with the Reubenites and Gadites in Gilead and reported to the Israelites .
NIVUK	Joshua	22	33	They were glad to hear the report and praised God . And they talked no more about going to war against them to devastate the country where the Reubenites and the Gadites lived .
NIVUK	Joshua	22	34	And the Reubenites and the Gadites gave the altar this name : A Witness Between Us – that the Lord is God .

NIVUK	Joshua	23	23	After a long time had passed and the Lord had given Israel rest from all their enemies around them , Joshua , by then a very old man ,
NIVUK	Joshua	23	2	summoned all Israel – their elders , leaders , judges and officials – and said to them : ‘ I am very old .
NIVUK	Joshua	23	3	You yourselves have seen everything the Lord your God has done to all these nations for your sake ; it was the Lord your God who fought for you .
NIVUK	Joshua	23	4	Remember how I have allotted as an inheritance for your tribes all the land of the nations that remain – the nations I conquered – between the Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea in the west .
NIVUK	Joshua	23	5	The Lord your God himself will push them out for your sake . He will drive them out before you , and you will take possession of their land , as the Lord your God promised you .
NIVUK	Joshua	23	6	‘ Be very strong ; be careful to obey all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses , without turning aside to the right or to the left .
NIVUK	Joshua	23	7	Do not associate with these nations that remain among you ; do not invoke the names of their gods or swear by them . You must not serve them or bow down to them .
NIVUK	Joshua	23	8	But you are to hold fast to the Lord your God , as you have until now .
NIVUK	Joshua	23	9	‘ The Lord has driven out before you great and powerful nations ; to this day no one has been able to withstand you .
NIVUK	Joshua	23	10	One of you routs a thousand , because the Lord your God fights for you , just as he promised .
NIVUK	Joshua	23	11	So be very careful to love the Lord your God .
NIVUK	Joshua	23	12	‘ But if you turn away and ally yourselves with the survivors of these nations that remain among you and if you intermarry with them and associate with them ,
NIVUK	Joshua	23	13	then you may be sure that the Lord your God will no longer drive out these nations before you . Instead , they will become snares and traps for you , whips on your backs and thorns in your eyes , until you perish from this good land , which the Lord your God has given you .
NIVUK	Joshua	23	14	‘ Now I am about to go the way of all the earth . You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the Lord your God gave you has failed . Every promise has been fulfilled ; not one has failed .
NIVUK	Joshua	23	15	But just as all the good things the Lord your God has promised you have come to you , so he will bring on you all the evil things he has threatened , until the Lord your God has destroyed you from this good land he has given you .
NIVUK	Joshua	23	16	If you violate the covenant of the Lord your God , which he commanded you , and go and serve other gods and bow down to them , the Lord ’ s anger will burn against you , and you will quickly perish from the good land he has given you. ’ Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Joshua	24	24	And the people said to Joshua , ‘ We will serve the Lord our God and obey him. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	24	2	Joshua said to all the people , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : “ Long ago your ancestors , including Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor , lived beyond the River Euphrates and worshipped other gods .
NIVUK	Joshua	24	3	But I took your father Abraham from the land beyond the Euphrates and led him throughout Canaan and gave him many descendants . I gave him Isaac ,
NIVUK	Joshua	24	4	and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau . I assigned the hill country of Seir to Esau , but Jacob and his family went down to Egypt .
NIVUK	Joshua	24	5	‘ “ Then I sent Moses and Aaron , and I afflicted the Egyptians by what I did there , and I brought you out .
NIVUK	Joshua	24	6	When I brought your people out of Egypt , you came to the sea , and the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen [ a ] as far as the Red Sea . [ b ]
NIVUK	Joshua	24	7	But they cried to the Lord for help , and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians ; he brought the sea over them and covered them . You saw with your own eyes what I did to the Egyptians . Then you lived in the wilderness for a long time .
NIVUK	Joshua	24	8	‘ “ I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived east of the Jordan . They fought against you , but I gave them into your hands . I destroyed them from before you , and you took possession of their land .
NIVUK	Joshua	24	9	When Balak son of Zippor , the king of Moab , prepared to fight against Israel , he sent for Balaam son of Beor to put a curse on you .
NIVUK	Joshua	24	10	But I would not listen to Balaam , so he blessed you again and again , and I delivered you out of his hand .
NIVUK	Joshua	24	11	‘ “ Then you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho . The citizens of Jericho fought against you , as did also the Amorites , Perizzites , Canaanites , Hittites , Girgashites , Hivites and Jebusites , but I gave them into your hands .
NIVUK	Joshua	24	12	I sent the hornet ahead of you , which drove them out before you – also the two Amorite kings . You did not do it with your own sword and bow .
NIVUK	Joshua	24	13	So I gave you a land on which you did not toil and cities you did not build ; and you live in them and eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant. ”
NIVUK	Joshua	24	14	‘ Now fear the Lord and serve him with all faithfulness . Throw away the gods your ancestors worshipped beyond the River Euphrates and in Egypt , and serve the Lord .
NIVUK	Joshua	24	15	But if serving the Lord seems undesirable to you , then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve , whether the gods your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates , or the gods of the Amorites , in whose land you are living . But as for me and my household , we will serve the Lord. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	24	16	Then the people answered , ‘ Far be it from us to forsake the Lord to serve other gods !
NIVUK	Joshua	24	17	It was the Lord our God himself who brought us and our parents up out of Egypt , from that land of slavery , and performed those great signs before our eyes . He protected us on our entire journey and among all the nations through which we travelled .
NIVUK	Joshua	24	18	And the Lord drove out before us all the nations , including the Amorites , who lived in the land . We too will serve the Lord , because he is our God. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	24	19	Joshua said to the people , ‘ You are not able to serve the Lord . He is a holy God ; he is a jealous God . He will not forgive your rebellion and your sins .
NIVUK	Joshua	24	20	If you forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods , he will turn and bring disaster on you and make an end of you , after he has been good to you. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	24	21	But the people said to Joshua , ‘ No ! We will serve the Lord. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	24	22	Then Joshua said , ‘ You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the Lord. ’ ‘ Yes , we are witnesses , ’ they replied .
NIVUK	Joshua	24	23	‘ Now then , ’ said Joshua , ‘ throw away the foreign gods that are among you and yield your hearts to the Lord , the God of Israel. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	24	25	On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people , and there at Shechem he reaffirmed for them decrees and laws .
NIVUK	Joshua	24	26	And Joshua recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God . Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak near the holy place of the Lord .
NIVUK	Joshua	24	27	‘ See ! ’ he said to all the people . ‘ This stone will be a witness against us . It has heard all the words the Lord has said to us . It will be a witness against you if you are untrue to your God. ’
NIVUK	Joshua	24	28	Then Joshua dismissed the people , each to their own inheritance . Buried in the promised land
NIVUK	Joshua	24	29	After these things , Joshua son of Nun , the servant of the Lord , died at the age of a hundred and ten .
NIVUK	Joshua	24	30	And they buried him in the land of his inheritance , at Timnath Serah [ c ] in the hill country of Ephraim , north of Mount Gaash .
NIVUK	Joshua	24	31	Israel served the Lord throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had experienced everything the Lord had done for Israel .

NIVUK	Judges	1	1	After the death of Joshua , the Israelites asked the Lord , ‘ Who of us is to go up first to fight against the Canaanites ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	1	2	The Lord answered , ‘ Judah shall go up ; I have given the land into their hands. ’
NIVUK	Judges	1	3	The men of Judah then said to the Simeonites their fellow Israelites , ‘ Come up with us into the territory allotted to us , to fight against the Canaanites . We in turn will go with you into yours. ’ So the Simeonites went with them .
NIVUK	Judges	1	4	When Judah attacked , the Lord gave the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands , and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek .
NIVUK	Judges	1	5	It was there that they found Adoni-Bezek and fought against him , putting to rout the Canaanites and Perizzites .
NIVUK	Judges	1	6	Adoni-Bezek fled , but they chased him and caught him , and cut off his thumbs and big toes .
NIVUK	Judges	1	7	Then Adoni-Bezek said , ‘ Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have picked up scraps under my table . Now God has paid me back for what I did to them. ’ They brought him to Jerusalem , and he died there .
NIVUK	Judges	1	8	The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem also and took it . They put the city to the sword and set it on fire .
NIVUK	Judges	1	9	After that , Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country , the Negev and the western foothills .
NIVUK	Judges	1	10	They advanced against the Canaanites living in Hebron ( formerly called Kiriath Arba ) and defeated Sheshai , Ahiman and Talmai .
NIVUK	Judges	1	11	From there they advanced against the people living in Debir ( formerly called Kiriath Sepher ) .
NIVUK	Judges	1	12	And Caleb said , ‘ I will give my daughter Aksah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher. ’
NIVUK	Judges	1	13	Othniel son of Kenaz , Caleb ’ s younger brother , took it ; so Caleb gave his daughter Aksah to him in marriage .
NIVUK	Judges	1	14	One day when she came to Othniel , she urged him [ a ] to ask her father for a field . When she got off her donkey , Caleb asked her , ‘ What can I do for you ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	1	15	She replied , ‘ Do me a special favour . Since you have given me land in the Negev , give me also springs of water. ’ So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs .
NIVUK	Judges	1	16	The descendants of Moses ’ father-in-law , the Kenite , went up from the City of Palms [ b ] with the people of Judah to live among the inhabitants of the Desert of Judah in the Negev near Arad .
NIVUK	Judges	1	17	Then the men of Judah went with the Simeonites their fellow Israelites and attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath , and they totally destroyed [ c ] the city . Therefore it was called Hormah . [ d ]
NIVUK	Judges	1	18	Judah also took [ e ] Gaza , Ashkelon and Ekron – each city with its territory .
NIVUK	Judges	1	19	The Lord was with the men of Judah . They took possession of the hill country , but they were unable to drive the people from the plains , because they had chariots fitted with iron .
NIVUK	Judges	1	20	As Moses had promised , Hebron was given to Caleb , who drove from it the three sons of Anak .
NIVUK	Judges	1	21	The Benjaminites , however , did not drive out the Jebusites , who were living in Jerusalem ; to this day the Jebusites live there with the Benjaminites .
NIVUK	Judges	1	22	Now the tribes of Joseph attacked Bethel , and the Lord was with them .
NIVUK	Judges	1	23	When they sent men to spy out Bethel ( formerly called Luz ) ,
NIVUK	Judges	1	24	the spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him , ‘ Show us how to get into the city and we will see that you are treated well. ’
NIVUK	Judges	1	25	So he showed them , and they put the city to the sword but spared the man and his whole family .
NIVUK	Judges	1	26	He then went to the land of the Hittites , where he built a city and called it Luz , which is its name to this day .
NIVUK	Judges	1	27	But Manasseh did not drive out the people of Beth Shan or Taanach or Dor or Ibleam or Megiddo and their surrounding settlements , for the Canaanites were determined to live in that land .
NIVUK	Judges	1	28	When Israel became strong , they pressed the Canaanites into forced labour but never drove them out completely .
NIVUK	Judges	1	29	Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer , but the Canaanites continued to live there among them .
NIVUK	Judges	1	30	Neither did Zebulun drive out the Canaanites living in Kitron or Nahalol , so these Canaanites lived among them , but Zebulun did subject them to forced labour .
NIVUK	Judges	1	31	Nor did Asher drive out those living in Akko or Sidon or Ahlab or Akzib or Helbah or Aphek or Rehob .
NIVUK	Judges	1	32	The Asherites lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land because they did not drive them out .
NIVUK	Judges	1	33	Neither did Naphtali drive out those living in Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath ; but the Naphtalites too lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land , and those living in Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath became forced labourers for them .
NIVUK	Judges	1	34	The Amorites confined the Danites to the hill country , not allowing them to come down into the plain .
NIVUK	Judges	1	35	And the Amorites were determined also to hold out in Mount Heres , Aijalon and Shaalbim , but when the power of the tribes of Joseph increased , they too were pressed into forced labour .
NIVUK	Judges	1	36	The boundary of the Amorites was from Scorpion Pass to Sela and beyond .

NIVUK	Judges	2	2	and you shall not make a covenant with the people of this land , but you shall break down their altars. ” Yet you have disobeyed me . Why have you done this ?
NIVUK	Judges	2	3	And I have also said , “ I will not drive them out before you ; they will become traps for you , and their gods will become snares to you. ” ’
NIVUK	Judges	2	4	When the angel of the Lord had spoken these things to all the Israelites , the people wept aloud ,
NIVUK	Judges	2	5	and they called that place Bokim . [ a ] There they offered sacrifices to the Lord . Disobedience and defeat
NIVUK	Judges	2	6	After Joshua had dismissed the Israelites , they went to take possession of the land , each to their own inheritance .
NIVUK	Judges	2	7	The people served the Lord throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had seen all the great things the Lord had done for Israel .
NIVUK	Judges	2	8	Joshua son of Nun , the servant of the Lord , died at the age of a hundred and ten .
NIVUK	Judges	2	9	And they buried him in the land of his inheritance , at Timnath Heres [ b ] in the hill country of Ephraim , north of Mount Gaash .
NIVUK	Judges	2	10	After that whole generation had been gathered to their ancestors , another generation grew up who knew neither the Lord nor what he had done for Israel .
NIVUK	Judges	2	11	Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord and served the Baals .
NIVUK	Judges	2	12	They forsook the Lord , the God of their ancestors , who had brought them out of Egypt . They followed and worshipped various gods of the peoples around them . They aroused the Lord ’ s anger
NIVUK	Judges	2	13	because they forsook him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths .
NIVUK	Judges	2	14	In his anger against Israel the Lord gave them into the hands of raiders who plundered them . He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around , whom they were no longer able to resist .
NIVUK	Judges	2	15	Whenever Israel went out to fight , the hand of the Lord was against them to defeat them , just as he had sworn to them . They were in great distress .
NIVUK	Judges	2	16	Then the Lord raised up judges , [ c ] who saved them out of the hands of these raiders .
NIVUK	Judges	2	17	Yet they would not listen to their judges but prostituted themselves to other gods and worshipped them . They quickly turned from the ways of their ancestors , who had been obedient to the Lord ’ s commands .
NIVUK	Judges	2	18	Whenever the Lord raised up a judge for them , he was with the judge and saved them out of the hands of their enemies as long as the judge lived ; for the Lord relented because of their groaning under those who oppressed and afflicted them .
NIVUK	Judges	2	19	But when the judge died , the people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their ancestors , following other gods and serving and worshipping them . They refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways .
NIVUK	Judges	2	20	Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel and said , ‘ Because this nation has violated the covenant I ordained for their ancestors and has not listened to me ,
NIVUK	Judges	2	21	I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died .
NIVUK	Judges	2	22	I will use them to test Israel and see whether they will keep the way of the Lord and walk in it as their ancestors did. ’
NIVUK	Judges	2	23	The Lord had allowed those nations to remain ; he did not drive them out at once by giving them into the hands of Joshua .

NIVUK	Judges	3	2	( he did this only to teach warfare to the descendants of the Israelites who had not had previous battle experience ) :
NIVUK	Judges	3	4	They were left to test the Israelites to see whether they would obey the Lord ’ s commands , which he had given their ancestors through Moses .
NIVUK	Judges	3	5	The Israelites lived among the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites and Jebusites .
NIVUK	Judges	3	6	They took their daughters in marriage and gave their own daughters to their sons , and served their gods . Othniel
NIVUK	Judges	3	7	The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord ; they forgot the Lord their God and served the Baals and the Asherahs .
NIVUK	Judges	3	8	The anger of the Lord burned against Israel so that he sold them into the hands of Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram Naharaim , [ a ] to whom the Israelites were subject for eight years .
NIVUK	Judges	3	9	But when they cried out to the Lord , he raised up for them a deliverer , Othniel son of Kenaz , Caleb ’ s younger brother , who saved them .
NIVUK	Judges	3	10	The Spirit of the Lord came on him , so that he became Israel ’ s judge [ b ] and went to war . The Lord gave Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram into the hands of Othniel , who overpowered him .
NIVUK	Judges	3	11	So the land had peace for forty years , until Othniel son of Kenaz died . Ehud
NIVUK	Judges	3	12	Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord , and because they did this evil the Lord gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel .
NIVUK	Judges	3	13	Getting the Ammonites and Amalekites to join him , Eglon came and attacked Israel , and they took possession of the City of Palms . [ c ]
NIVUK	Judges	3	14	The Israelites were subject to Eglon king of Moab for eighteen years .
NIVUK	Judges	3	15	Again the Israelites cried out to the Lord , and he gave them a deliverer – Ehud , a left-handed man , the son of Gera the Benjaminite . The Israelites sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab .
NIVUK	Judges	3	16	Now Ehud had made a double-edged sword about a cubit [ d ] long , which he strapped to his right thigh under his clothing .
NIVUK	Judges	3	17	He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab , who was a very fat man .
NIVUK	Judges	3	18	After Ehud had presented the tribute , he sent on their way those who had carried it .
NIVUK	Judges	3	19	But on reaching the stone images near Gilgal he himself went back to Eglon and said , ‘ Your majesty , I have a secret message for you. ’ The king said to his attendants , ‘ Leave us ! ’ And they all left .
NIVUK	Judges	3	20	Ehud then approached him while he was sitting alone in the upper room of his palace [ e ] and said , ‘ I have a message from God for you. ’ As the king rose from his seat ,
NIVUK	Judges	3	21	Ehud reached with his left hand , drew the sword from his right thigh and plunged it into the king ’ s belly .
NIVUK	Judges	3	22	Even the handle sank in after the blade , and his bowels discharged . Ehud did not pull the sword out , and the fat closed in over it .
NIVUK	Judges	3	23	Then Ehud went out to the porch ; [ f ] he shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them .

NIVUK	Judges	3	25	They waited to the point of embarrassment , but when he did not open the doors of the room , they took a key and unlocked them . There they saw their lord fallen to the floor , dead .
NIVUK	Judges	3	26	While they waited , Ehud got away . He passed by the stone images and escaped to Seirah .
NIVUK	Judges	3	27	When he arrived there , he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim , and the Israelites went down with him from the hills , with him leading them .
NIVUK	Judges	3	28	‘ Follow me , ’ he ordered , ‘ for the Lord has given Moab , your enemy , into your hands. ’ So they followed him down and took possession of the fords of the Jordan that led to Moab ; they allowed no one to cross over .
NIVUK	Judges	3	29	At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites , all vigorous and strong ; not one escaped .
NIVUK	Judges	3	30	That day Moab was made subject to Israel , and the land had peace for eighty years . Shamgar

NIVUK	Judges	4	4	Now Deborah , a prophet , the wife of Lappidoth , was leading [ a ] Israel at that time .
NIVUK	Judges	4	2	So the Lord sold them into the hands of Jabin king of Canaan , who reigned in Hazor . Sisera , the commander of his army , was based in Harosheth Haggoyim .
NIVUK	Judges	4	3	Because he had nine hundred chariots fitted with iron and had cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years , they cried to the Lord for help .
NIVUK	Judges	4	5	She held court under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim , and the Israelites went up to her to have their disputes decided .
NIVUK	Judges	4	6	She sent for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him , ‘ The Lord , the God of Israel , commands you : “ Go , take with you ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun and lead them up to Mount Tabor .
NIVUK	Judges	4	7	I will lead Sisera , the commander of Jabin ’ s army , with his chariots and his troops to the River Kishon and give him into your hands. ” ’
NIVUK	Judges	4	8	Barak said to her , ‘ If you go with me , I will go ; but if you don ’ t go with me , I won ’ t go. ’
NIVUK	Judges	4	9	‘ Certainly I will go with you , ’ said Deborah . ‘ But because of the course you are taking , the honour will not be yours , for the Lord will deliver Sisera into the hands of a woman. ’ So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh .
NIVUK	Judges	4	10	There Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali , and ten thousand men went up under his command . Deborah also went up with him .
NIVUK	Judges	4	11	Now Heber the Kenite had left the other Kenites , the descendants of Hobab , Moses ’ brother-in-law , [ b ] and pitched his tent by the great tree in Zaanannim near Kedesh .
NIVUK	Judges	4	12	When they told Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor ,
NIVUK	Judges	4	13	Sisera summoned from Harosheth Haggoyim to the River Kishon all his men and his nine hundred chariots fitted with iron .
NIVUK	Judges	4	14	Then Deborah said to Barak , ‘ Go ! This is the day the Lord has given Sisera into your hands . Has not the Lord gone ahead of you ? ’ So Barak went down Mount Tabor , with ten thousand men following him .
NIVUK	Judges	4	15	At Barak ’ s advance , the Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword , and Sisera got down from his chariot and fled on foot .
NIVUK	Judges	4	16	Barak pursued the chariots and army as far as Harosheth Haggoyim , and all Sisera ’ s troops fell by the sword ; not a man was left .
NIVUK	Judges	4	17	Sisera , meanwhile , fled on foot to the tent of Jael , the wife of Heber the Kenite , because there was an alliance between Jabin king of Hazor and the family of Heber the Kenite .
NIVUK	Judges	4	18	Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him , ‘ Come , my lord , come right in . Don ’ t be afraid. ’ So he entered her tent , and she covered him with a blanket .
NIVUK	Judges	4	19	‘ I ’ m thirsty , ’ he said . ‘ Please give me some water. ’ She opened a skin of milk , gave him a drink , and covered him up .
NIVUK	Judges	4	20	‘ Stand in the doorway of the tent , ’ he told her . ‘ If someone comes and asks you , “ Is anyone in there ? ” say “ No. ” ’
NIVUK	Judges	4	21	But Jael , Heber ’ s wife , picked up a tent peg and a hammer and went quietly to him while he lay fast asleep , exhausted . She drove the peg through his temple into the ground , and he died .
NIVUK	Judges	4	22	Just then Barak came by in pursuit of Sisera , and Jael went out to meet him . ‘ Come , ’ she said , ‘ I will show you the man you ’ re looking for. ’ So he went in with her , and there lay Sisera with the tent peg through his temple – dead .
NIVUK	Judges	4	23	On that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the Israelites .

NIVUK	Judges	6	6	Midian so impoverished the Israelites that they cried out to the Lord for help .
NIVUK	Judges	6	2	Because the power of Midian was so oppressive , the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in mountain clefts , caves and strongholds .
NIVUK	Judges	6	3	Whenever the Israelites planted their crops , the Midianites , Amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country .
NIVUK	Judges	6	4	They camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to Gaza and did not spare a living thing for Israel , neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys .
NIVUK	Judges	6	5	They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts . It was impossible to count them or their camels ; they invaded the land to ravage it .
NIVUK	Judges	6	7	When the Israelites cried out to the Lord because of Midian ,
NIVUK	Judges	6	8	he sent them a prophet , who said , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : I brought you up out of Egypt , out of the land of slavery .
NIVUK	Judges	6	9	I rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians . And I delivered you from the hand of all your oppressors ; I drove them out before you and gave you their land .

NIVUK	Judges	6	11	The angel of the Lord came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite , where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites .
NIVUK	Judges	6	12	When the angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon , he said , ‘ The Lord is with you , mighty warrior. ’
NIVUK	Judges	6	13	‘ Pardon me , my lord , ’ Gideon replied , ‘ but if the Lord is with us , why has all this happened to us ? Where are all his wonders that our ancestors told us about when they said , “ Did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt ? ” But now the Lord has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian. ’
NIVUK	Judges	6	14	The Lord turned to him and said , ‘ Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian ’ s hand . Am I not sending you ? ’

NIVUK	Judges	6	19	Gideon went inside , prepared a young goat , and from an ephah [ a ] of flour he made bread without yeast . Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot , he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak .
NIVUK	Judges	6	20	The angel of God said to him , ‘ Take the meat and the unleavened bread , place them on this rock , and pour out the broth. ’ And Gideon did so .
NIVUK	Judges	6	21	Then the angel of the Lord touched the meat and the unleavened bread with the tip of the staff that was in his hand . Fire flared from the rock , consuming the meat and the bread . And the angel of the Lord disappeared .
NIVUK	Judges	6	22	When Gideon realised that it was the angel of the Lord , he exclaimed , ‘ Alas , Sovereign Lord ! I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face ! ’
NIVUK	Judges	6	23	But the Lord said to him , ‘ Peace ! Do not be afraid . You are not going to die. ’
NIVUK	Judges	6	24	So Gideon built an altar to the Lord there and called it The Lord Is Peace . To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .

NIVUK	Judges	6	27	So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the Lord told him . But because he was afraid of his family and the townspeople , he did it at night rather than in the daytime .

NIVUK	Judges	6	29	They asked each other , ‘ Who did this ? ’ When they carefully investigated , they were told , ‘ Gideon son of Joash did it. ’

NIVUK	Judges	6	31	But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him , ‘ Are you going to plead Baal ’ s cause ? Are you trying to save him ? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning ! If Baal really is a god , he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar. ’
NIVUK	Judges	6	32	So because Gideon broke down Baal ’ s altar , they gave him the name Jerub-Baal [ f ] that day , saying , ‘ Let Baal contend with him. ’
NIVUK	Judges	6	33	Now all the Midianites , Amalekites and other eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel .
NIVUK	Judges	6	34	Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Gideon , and he blew a trumpet , summoning the Abiezrites to follow him .
NIVUK	Judges	6	35	He sent messengers throughout Manasseh , calling them to arms , and also into Asher , Zebulun and Naphtali , so that they too went up to meet them .
NIVUK	Judges	6	36	Gideon said to God , ‘ If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised –
NIVUK	Judges	6	37	look , I will place a wool fleece on the threshing-floor . If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry , then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand , as you said. ’
NIVUK	Judges	6	38	And that is what happened . Gideon rose early the next day ; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew – a bowlful of water .
NIVUK	Judges	6	39	Then Gideon said to God , ‘ Do not be angry with me . Let me make just one more request . Allow me one more test with the fleece , but this time make the fleece dry and let the ground be covered with dew. ’
NIVUK	Judges	6	40	That night God did so . Only the fleece was dry ; all the ground was covered with dew . Footnotes - Judges 6:19 That is , probably about

NIVUK	Judges	7	7	The Lord said to Gideon , ‘ With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands . Let all the others go home. ’
NIVUK	Judges	7	2	The Lord said to Gideon , ‘ You have too many men . I can not deliver Midian into their hands , or Israel would boast against me , “ My own strength has saved me. ”
NIVUK	Judges	7	3	Now announce to the army , “ Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead. ” ’ So twenty-two thousand men left , while ten thousand remained .
NIVUK	Judges	7	4	But the Lord said to Gideon , ‘ There are still too many men . Take them down to the water , and I will thin them out for you there . If I say , “ This one shall go with you , ” he shall go ; but if I say , “ This one shall not go with you , ” he shall not go. ’
NIVUK	Judges	7	5	So Gideon took the men down to the water . There the Lord told him , ‘ Separate those who lap the water with their tongues as a dog laps from those who kneel down to drink. ’
NIVUK	Judges	7	6	Three hundred of them drank from cupped hands , lapping like dogs . All the rest got down on their knees to drink .
NIVUK	Judges	7	8	So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites home but kept the three hundred , who took over the provisions and trumpets of the others . Now the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley .
NIVUK	Judges	7	9	During that night the Lord said to Gideon , ‘ Get up , go down against the camp , because I am going to give it into your hands .
NIVUK	Judges	7	10	If you are afraid to attack , go down to the camp with your servant Purah
NIVUK	Judges	7	11	and listen to what they are saying . Afterwards , you will be encouraged to attack the camp. ’ So he and Purah his servant went down to the outposts of the camp .
NIVUK	Judges	7	12	The Midianites , the Amalekites and all the other eastern peoples had settled in the valley , thick as locusts . Their camels could no more be counted than the sand on the seashore .
NIVUK	Judges	7	13	Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream . ‘ I had a dream , ’ he was saying . ‘ A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp . It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed. ’
NIVUK	Judges	7	14	His friend responded , ‘ This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash , the Israelite . God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands. ’
NIVUK	Judges	7	15	When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation , he bowed down and worshipped . He returned to the camp of Israel and called out , ‘ Get up ! The Lord has given the Midianite camp into your hands. ’
NIVUK	Judges	7	16	Dividing the three hundred men into three companies , he placed trumpets and empty jars in the hands of all of them , with torches inside .
NIVUK	Judges	7	17	‘ Watch me , ’ he told them . ‘ Follow my lead . When I get to the edge of the camp , do exactly as I do .
NIVUK	Judges	7	18	When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets , then from all round the camp blow yours and shout , “ For the Lord and for Gideon. ” ’
NIVUK	Judges	7	19	Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch , just after they had changed the guard . They blew their trumpets and broke the jars that were in their hands .
NIVUK	Judges	7	20	The three companies blew the trumpets and smashed the jars . Grasping the torches in their left hands and holding in their right hands the trumpets they were to blow , they shouted , ‘ A sword for the Lord and for Gideon ! ’
NIVUK	Judges	7	21	While each man held his position round the camp , all the Midianites ran , crying out as they fled .
NIVUK	Judges	7	22	When the three hundred trumpets sounded , the Lord caused the men throughout the camp to turn on each other with their swords . The army fled to Beth Shittah towards Zererah as far as the border of Abel Meholah near Tabbath .
NIVUK	Judges	7	23	Israelites from Naphtali , Asher and all Manasseh were called out , and they pursued the Midianites .
NIVUK	Judges	7	24	Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim , saying , ‘ Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth Barah. ’ So all the men of Ephraim were called out and they seized the waters of the Jordan as far as Beth Barah .
NIVUK	Judges	7	25	They also captured two of the Midianite leaders , Oreb and Zeeb . They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb , and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb .

NIVUK	Judges	8	8	From there he went up to Peniel [ a ] and made the same request of them , but they answered as the men of Sukkoth had .
NIVUK	Judges	8	2	But he answered them , ‘ What have I accomplished compared to you ? Aren ’ t the gleanings of Ephraim ’ s grapes better than the full grape harvest of Abiezer ?
NIVUK	Judges	8	3	God gave Oreb and Zeeb , the Midianite leaders , into your hands . What was I able to do compared to you ? ’ At this , their resentment against him subsided .
NIVUK	Judges	8	4	Gideon and his three hundred men , exhausted yet keeping up the pursuit , came to the Jordan and crossed it .
NIVUK	Judges	8	5	He said to the men of Sukkoth , ‘ Give my troops some bread ; they are worn out , and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna , the kings of Midian. ’
NIVUK	Judges	8	6	But the officials of Sukkoth said , ‘ Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession ? Why should we give bread to your troops ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	8	7	Then Gideon replied , ‘ Just for that , when the Lord has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand , I will tear your flesh with desert thorns and briers. ’
NIVUK	Judges	8	9	and
NIVUK	Judges	8	10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with a force of about fifteen thousand men , all that were left of the armies of the eastern peoples ; a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had fallen .
NIVUK	Judges	8	11	Gideon went up by the route of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the unsuspecting army .
NIVUK	Judges	8	12	Zebah and Zalmunna , the two kings of Midian , fled , but he pursued them and captured them , routing their entire army .
NIVUK	Judges	8	13	Gideon son of Joash then returned from the battle by the Pass of Heres .
NIVUK	Judges	8	14	He caught a young man of Sukkoth and questioned him , and the young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven officials of Sukkoth , the elders of the town .
NIVUK	Judges	8	15	Then Gideon came and said to the men of Sukkoth , ‘ Here are Zebah and Zalmunna , about whom you taunted me by saying , “ Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession ? Why should we give bread to your exhausted men ? ” ’
NIVUK	Judges	8	16	He took the elders of the town and taught the men of Sukkoth a lesson by punishing them with desert thorns and briers .

NIVUK	Judges	8	18	Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna , ‘ What kind of men did you kill at Tabor ? ’ ‘ Men like you , ’ they answered , ‘ each one with the bearing of a prince. ’
NIVUK	Judges	8	19	Gideon replied , ‘ Those were my brothers , the sons of my own mother . As surely as the Lord lives , if you had spared their lives , I would not kill you. ’

NIVUK	Judges	8	21	Zebah and Zalmunna said , ‘ Come , do it yourself . “ As is the man , so is his strength. ” ’ So Gideon stepped forward and killed them , and took the ornaments off their camels ’ necks . Gideon ’ s ephod
NIVUK	Judges	8	22	The Israelites said to Gideon , ‘ Rule over us – you , your son and your grandson – because you have saved us from the hand of Midian. ’
NIVUK	Judges	8	23	But Gideon told them , ‘ I will not rule over you , nor will my son rule over you . The Lord will rule over you. ’
NIVUK	Judges	8	24	And he said , ‘ I do have one request , that each of you give me an earring from your share of the plunder. ’ ( It was the custom of the Ishmaelites to wear gold earrings . )
NIVUK	Judges	8	25	They answered , ‘ We ’ ll be glad to give them. ’ So they spread out a garment , and each of them threw a ring from his plunder onto it .
NIVUK	Judges	8	26	The weight of the gold rings he asked for came to seventeen hundred shekels , [ b ] not counting the ornaments , the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian or the chains that were on their camels ’ necks .
NIVUK	Judges	8	27	Gideon made the gold into an ephod , which he placed in Ophrah , his town . All Israel prostituted themselves by worshipping it there , and it became a snare to Gideon and his family . Gideon ’ s death
NIVUK	Judges	8	28	Thus Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again . During Gideon ’ s lifetime , the land had peace for forty years .
NIVUK	Judges	8	29	Jerub-Baal son of Joash went back home to live .
NIVUK	Judges	8	30	He had seventy sons of his own , for he had many wives .
NIVUK	Judges	8	31	His concubine , who lived in Shechem , also bore him a son , whom he named Abimelek .
NIVUK	Judges	8	32	Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites .
NIVUK	Judges	8	33	No sooner had Gideon died than the Israelites again prostituted themselves to the Baals . They set up Baal-Berith as their god
NIVUK	Judges	8	34	and did not remember the Lord their God , who had rescued them from the hands of all their enemies on every side .
NIVUK	Judges	8	35	They also failed to show any loyalty to the family of Jerub-Baal ( that is , Gideon ) in spite of all the good things he had done for them . Footnotes - Judges 8:8 Hebrew Penuel , a variant of Peniel ; also in verses

NIVUK	Judges	9	9	‘ But the olive tree answered , “ Should I give up my oil , by which both gods and humans are honoured , to hold sway over the trees ? ”
NIVUK	Judges	9	2	‘ Ask all the citizens of Shechem , “ Which is better for you : to have all seventy of Jerub-Baal ’ s sons rule over you , or just one man ? ” Remember , I am your flesh and blood. ’
NIVUK	Judges	9	3	When the brothers repeated all this to the citizens of Shechem , they were inclined to follow Abimelek , for they said , ‘ He is related to us. ’
NIVUK	Judges	9	4	They gave him seventy shekels [ a ] of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith , and Abimelek used it to hire reckless scoundrels , who became his followers .
NIVUK	Judges	9	5	He went to his father ’ s home in Ophrah and on one stone murdered his seventy brothers , the sons of Jerub-Baal . But Jotham , the youngest son of Jerub-Baal , escaped by hiding .
NIVUK	Judges	9	6	Then all the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo gathered beside the great tree at the pillar in Shechem to crown Abimelek king .
NIVUK	Judges	9	7	When Jotham was told about this , he climbed up on the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted to them , ‘ Listen to me , citizens of Shechem , so that God may listen to you .
NIVUK	Judges	9	8	One day the trees went out to anoint a king for themselves . They said to the olive tree , “ Be our king. ”
NIVUK	Judges	9	10	‘ Next , the trees said to the fig-tree , “ Come and be our king. ”
NIVUK	Judges	9	11	‘ But the fig-tree replied , “ Should I give up my fruit , so good and sweet , to hold sway over the trees ? ”
NIVUK	Judges	9	12	‘ Then the trees said to the vine , “ Come and be our king. ”
NIVUK	Judges	9	13	‘ But the vine answered , “ Should I give up my wine , which cheers both gods and humans , to hold sway over the trees ? ”
NIVUK	Judges	9	14	‘ Finally all the trees said to the thorn-bush , “ Come and be our king. ”
NIVUK	Judges	9	15	‘ The thorn-bush said to the trees , “ If you really want to anoint me king over you , come and take refuge in my shade ; but if not , then let fire come out of the thorn-bush and consume the cedars of Lebanon ! ”
NIVUK	Judges	9	16	‘ Have you acted honourably and in good faith by making Abimelek king ? Have you been fair to Jerub-Baal and his family ? Have you treated him as he deserves ?
NIVUK	Judges	9	17	Remember that my father fought for you and risked his life to rescue you from the hand of Midian .
NIVUK	Judges	9	18	But today you have revolted against my father ’ s family . You have murdered his seventy sons on a single stone and have made Abimelek , the son of his female slave , king over the citizens of Shechem because he is related to you .
NIVUK	Judges	9	19	So have you acted honourably and in good faith towards Jerub-Baal and his family today ? If you have , may Abimelek be your joy , and may you be his , too !
NIVUK	Judges	9	20	But if you have not , let fire come out from Abimelek and consume you , the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo , and let fire come out from you , the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo , and consume Abimelek ! ’
NIVUK	Judges	9	21	Then Jotham fled , escaping to Beer , and he lived there because he was afraid of his brother Abimelek .
NIVUK	Judges	9	22	After Abimelek had governed Israel for three years ,
NIVUK	Judges	9	23	God stirred up animosity between Abimelek and the citizens of Shechem so that they acted treacherously against Abimelek .
NIVUK	Judges	9	24	God did this in order that the crime against Jerub-Baal ’ s seventy sons , the shedding of their blood , might be avenged on their brother Abimelek and on the citizens of Shechem , who had helped him murder his brothers .
NIVUK	Judges	9	25	In opposition to him these citizens of Shechem set men on the hilltops to ambush and rob everyone who passed by , and this was reported to Abimelek .
NIVUK	Judges	9	26	Now Gaal son of Ebed moved with his clan into Shechem , and its citizens put their confidence in him .
NIVUK	Judges	9	27	After they had gone out into the fields and gathered the grapes and trodden them , they held a festival in the temple of their god . While they were eating and drinking , they cursed Abimelek .
NIVUK	Judges	9	28	Then Gaal son of Ebed said , ‘ Who is Abimelek , and why should we Shechemites be subject to him ? Isn ’ t he Jerub-Baal ’ s son , and isn ’ t Zebul his deputy ? Serve the family of Hamor , Shechem ’ s father ! Why should we serve Abimelek ?
NIVUK	Judges	9	29	If only this people were under my command ! Then I would get rid of him . I would say to Abimelek , “ Call out your whole army ! ” ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	Judges	9	30	When Zebul the governor of the city heard what Gaal son of Ebed said , he was very angry .
NIVUK	Judges	9	31	Under cover he sent messengers to Abimelek , saying , ‘ Gaal son of Ebed and his clan have come to Shechem and are stirring up the city against you .
NIVUK	Judges	9	32	Now then , during the night you and your men should come and lie in wait in the fields .
NIVUK	Judges	9	33	In the morning at sunrise , advance against the city . When Gaal and his men come out against you , seize the opportunity to attack them. ’
NIVUK	Judges	9	34	So Abimelek and all his troops set out by night and took up concealed positions near Shechem in four companies .
NIVUK	Judges	9	35	Now Gaal son of Ebed had gone out and was standing at the entrance of the city gate just as Abimelek and his troops came out from their hiding-place .
NIVUK	Judges	9	36	When Gaal saw them , he said to Zebul , ‘ Look , people are coming down from the tops of the mountains ! ’ Zebul replied , ‘ You mistake the shadows of the mountains for men. ’
NIVUK	Judges	9	37	But Gaal spoke up again : ‘ Look , people are coming down from the central hill , [ c ] and a company is coming from the direction of the diviners ’ tree. ’
NIVUK	Judges	9	38	Then Zebul said to him , ‘ Where is your big talk now , you who said , “ Who is Abimelek that we should be subject to him ? ” Aren ’ t these the men you ridiculed ? Go out and fight them ! ’
NIVUK	Judges	9	39	So Gaal led out [ d ] the citizens of Shechem and fought Abimelek .
NIVUK	Judges	9	40	Abimelek chased him all the way to the entrance of the gate , and many were killed as they fled .
NIVUK	Judges	9	41	Then Abimelek stayed in Arumah , and Zebul drove Gaal and his clan out of Shechem .
NIVUK	Judges	9	42	The next day the people of Shechem went out to the fields , and this was reported to Abimelek .
NIVUK	Judges	9	43	So he took his men , divided them into three companies and set an ambush in the fields . When he saw the people coming out of the city , he rose to attack them .
NIVUK	Judges	9	44	Abimelek and the companies with him rushed forward to a position at the entrance of the city gate . Then two companies attacked those in the fields and struck them down .
NIVUK	Judges	9	45	All that day Abimelek pressed his attack against the city until he had captured it and killed its people . Then he destroyed the city and scattered salt over it .
NIVUK	Judges	9	46	On hearing this , the citizens in the tower of Shechem went into the stronghold of the temple of El-Berith .
NIVUK	Judges	9	47	When Abimelek heard that they had assembled there ,
NIVUK	Judges	9	48	he and all his men went up Mount Zalmon . He took an axe and cut off some branches , which he lifted to his shoulders . He ordered the men with him , ‘ Quick ! Do what you have seen me do ! ’
NIVUK	Judges	9	49	So all the men cut branches and followed Abimelek . They piled them against the stronghold and set it on fire with the people still inside . So all the people in the tower of Shechem , about a thousand men and women , also died .
NIVUK	Judges	9	50	Next Abimelek went to Thebez and besieged it and captured it .
NIVUK	Judges	9	51	Inside the city , however , was a strong tower , to which all the men and women – all the people of the city – had fled . They had locked themselves in and climbed up on the tower roof .
NIVUK	Judges	9	52	Abimelek went to the tower and attacked it . But as he approached the entrance to the tower to set it on fire ,
NIVUK	Judges	9	53	a woman dropped an upper millstone on his head and cracked his skull .
NIVUK	Judges	9	54	Hurriedly he called to his armour-bearer , ‘ Draw your sword and kill me , so that they can ’ t say , “ A woman killed him. ” ’ So his servant ran him through , and he died .
NIVUK	Judges	9	55	When the Israelites saw that Abimelek was dead , they went home .
NIVUK	Judges	9	56	Thus God repaid the wickedness that Abimelek had done to his father by murdering his seventy brothers .
NIVUK	Judges	9	57	God also made the people of Shechem pay for all their wickedness . The curse of Jotham son of Jerub-Baal came on them . Footnotes - Judges 9:4 That is , about

NIVUK	Judges	10	6	Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord . They served the Baals and the Ashtoreths , and the gods of Aram , the gods of Sidon , the gods of Moab , the gods of the Ammonites and the gods of the Philistines . And because the Israelites forsook the Lord and no longer served him ,
NIVUK	Judges	10	7	he became angry with them . He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and the Ammonites ,
NIVUK	Judges	10	8	who that year shattered and crushed them . For eighteen years they oppressed all the Israelites on the east side of the Jordan in Gilead , the land of the Amorites .
NIVUK	Judges	10	9	The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah , Benjamin and Ephraim ; Israel was in great distress .
NIVUK	Judges	10	11	The Lord replied , ‘ When the Egyptians , the Amorites , the Ammonites , the Philistines ,
NIVUK	Judges	10	12	the Sidonians , the Amalekites and the Maonites [ c ] oppressed you and you cried to me for help , did I not save you from their hands ?
NIVUK	Judges	10	13	But you have forsaken me and served other gods , so I will no longer save you .
NIVUK	Judges	10	14	Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen . Let them save you when you are in trouble ! ’
NIVUK	Judges	10	15	But the Israelites said to the Lord , ‘ We have sinned . Do with us whatever you think best , but please rescue us now. ’
NIVUK	Judges	10	16	Then they got rid of the foreign gods among them and served the Lord . And he could bear Israel ’ s misery no longer .
NIVUK	Judges	10	17	When the Ammonites were called to arms and camped in Gilead , the Israelites assembled and camped at Mizpah .

NIVUK	Judges	11	11	So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead , and the people made him head and commander over them . And he repeated all his words before the Lord in Mizpah .
NIVUK	Judges	11	2	Gilead ’ s wife also bore him sons , and when they were grown up , they drove Jephthah away . ‘ You are not going to get any inheritance in our family , ’ they said , ‘ because you are the son of another woman. ’
NIVUK	Judges	11	3	So Jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of Tob , where a gang of scoundrels gathered around him and followed him .
NIVUK	Judges	11	4	Some time later , when the Ammonites were fighting against Israel ,
NIVUK	Judges	11	5	the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob .
NIVUK	Judges	11	6	‘ Come , ’ they said , ‘ be our commander , so we can fight the Ammonites. ’
NIVUK	Judges	11	7	Jephthah said to them , ‘ Didn ’ t you hate me and drive me from my father ’ s house ? Why do you come to me now , when you ’ re in trouble ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	11	8	The elders of Gilead said to him , ‘ Nevertheless , we are turning to you now ; come with us to fight the Ammonites , and you will be head over all of us who live in Gilead. ’
NIVUK	Judges	11	9	Jephthah answered , ‘ Suppose you take me back to fight the Ammonites and the Lord gives them to me – will I really be your head ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	11	10	The elders of Gilead replied , ‘ The Lord is our witness ; we will certainly do as you say. ’
NIVUK	Judges	11	12	Then Jephthah sent messengers to the Ammonite king with the question : ‘ What do you have against me that you have attacked my country ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	11	13	The king of the Ammonites answered Jephthah ’ s messengers , ‘ When Israel came up out of Egypt , they took away my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok , all the way to the Jordan . Now give it back peaceably. ’
NIVUK	Judges	11	14	Jephthah sent back messengers to the Ammonite king ,
NIVUK	Judges	11	15	saying : ‘ This is what Jephthah says : Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites .
NIVUK	Judges	11	16	But when they came up out of Egypt , Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea [ a ] and on to Kadesh .
NIVUK	Judges	11	17	Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom , saying , “ Give us permission to go through your country , ” but the king of Edom would not listen . They sent also to the king of Moab , and he refused . So Israel stayed at Kadesh .
NIVUK	Judges	11	18	‘ Next they travelled through the wilderness , skirted the lands of Edom and Moab , passed along the eastern side of the country of Moab , and camped on the other side of the Arnon . They did not enter the territory of Moab , for the Arnon was its border .
NIVUK	Judges	11	19	‘ Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites , who ruled in Heshbon , and said to him , “ Let us pass through your country to our own place. ”
NIVUK	Judges	11	20	Sihon , however , did not trust Israel [ b ] to pass through his territory . He mustered all his troops and encamped at Jahaz and fought with Israel .
NIVUK	Judges	11	21	‘ Then the Lord , the God of Israel , gave Sihon and his whole army into Israel ’ s hands , and they defeated them . Israel took over all the land of the Amorites who lived in that country ,
NIVUK	Judges	11	22	capturing all of it from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the desert to the Jordan .
NIVUK	Judges	11	23	‘ Now since the Lord , the God of Israel , has driven the Amorites out before his people Israel , what right have you to take it over ?
NIVUK	Judges	11	24	Will you not take what your god Chemosh gives you ? Likewise , whatever the Lord our God has given us , we will possess .
NIVUK	Judges	11	25	Are you any better than Balak son of Zippor , king of Moab ? Did he ever quarrel with Israel or fight with them ?
NIVUK	Judges	11	26	For three hundred years Israel occupied Heshbon , Aroer , the surrounding settlements and all the towns along the Arnon . Why didn ’ t you retake them during that time ?
NIVUK	Judges	11	27	I have not wronged you , but you are doing me wrong by waging war against me . Let the Lord , the Judge , decide the dispute this day between the Israelites and the Ammonites. ’
NIVUK	Judges	11	28	The king of Ammon , however , paid no attention to the message Jephthah sent him .
NIVUK	Judges	11	29	Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Jephthah . He crossed Gilead and Manasseh , passed through Mizpah of Gilead , and from there he advanced against the Ammonites .
NIVUK	Judges	11	30	And Jephthah made a vow to the Lord : ‘ If you give the Ammonites into my hands ,
NIVUK	Judges	11	31	whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the Lord ’ s , and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering. ’
NIVUK	Judges	11	32	Then Jephthah went over to fight the Ammonites , and the Lord gave them into his hands .
NIVUK	Judges	11	33	He devastated twenty towns from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith , as far as Abel Keramim . Thus Israel subdued Ammon .
NIVUK	Judges	11	34	When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah , who should come out to meet him but his daughter , dancing to the sound of tambourines ! She was an only child . Except for her he had neither son nor daughter .
NIVUK	Judges	11	35	When he saw her , he tore his clothes and cried , ‘ Oh no , my daughter ! You have brought me down and I am devastated . I have made a vow to the Lord that I can not break. ’
NIVUK	Judges	11	36	‘ My father , ’ she replied , ‘ you have given your word to the Lord . Do to me just as you promised , now that the Lord has avenged you of your enemies , the Ammonites .
NIVUK	Judges	11	37	But grant me this one request , ’ she said . ‘ Give me two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends , because I will never marry. ’
NIVUK	Judges	11	38	‘ You may go , ’ he said . And he let her go for two months . She and her friends went into the hills and wept because she would never marry .
NIVUK	Judges	11	39	After the two months , she returned to her father , and he did to her as he had vowed . And she was a virgin . From this comes the Israelite tradition
NIVUK	Judges	11	40	that each year the young women of Israel go out for four days to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite .

NIVUK	Judges	12	12	Then Elon died and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun .
NIVUK	Judges	12	2	Jephthah answered , ‘ I and my people were engaged in a great struggle with the Ammonites , and although I called , you didn ’ t save me out of their hands .
NIVUK	Judges	12	3	When I saw that you wouldn ’ t help , I took my life in my hands and crossed over to fight the Ammonites , and the Lord gave me the victory over them . Now why have you come up today to fight me ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	12	4	Jephthah then called together the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim . The Gileadites struck them down because the Ephraimites had said , ‘ You Gileadites are renegades from Ephraim and Manasseh. ’
NIVUK	Judges	12	5	The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim , and whenever a survivor of Ephraim said , ‘ Let me cross over , ’ the men of Gilead asked him , ‘ Are you an Ephraimite ? ’ If he replied , ‘ No , ’
NIVUK	Judges	12	6	they said , ‘ All right , say “ Shibboleth ” . ’ If he said , ‘ Sibboleth ’ , because he could not pronounce the word correctly , they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan . Forty-two thousand Ephraimites were killed at that time .

NIVUK	Judges	13	13	The angel of the Lord answered , ‘ Your wife must do all that I have told her .
NIVUK	Judges	13	2	A certain man of Zorah , named Manoah , from the clan of the Danites , had a wife who was childless , unable to give birth .
NIVUK	Judges	13	3	The angel of the Lord appeared to her and said , ‘ You are barren and childless , but you are going to become pregnant and give birth to a son .
NIVUK	Judges	13	4	Now see to it that you drink no wine or other fermented drink and that you do not eat anything unclean .
NIVUK	Judges	13	5	You will become pregnant and have a son whose head is never to be touched by a razor because the boy is to be a Nazirite , dedicated to God from the womb . He will take the lead in delivering Israel from the hands of the Philistines. ’
NIVUK	Judges	13	6	Then the woman went to her husband and told him , ‘ A man of God came to me . He looked like an angel of God , very awesome . I didn ’ t ask him where he came from , and he didn ’ t tell me his name .
NIVUK	Judges	13	7	But he said to me , “ You will become pregnant and have a son . Now then , drink no wine or other fermented drink and do not eat anything unclean , because the boy will be a Nazirite of God from the womb until the day of his death. ” ’
NIVUK	Judges	13	8	Then Manoah prayed to the Lord : ‘ Pardon your servant , Lord . I beg you to let the man of God you sent to us come again to teach us how to bring up the boy who is to be born. ’
NIVUK	Judges	13	9	God heard Manoah , and the angel of God came again to the woman while she was out in the field ; but her husband Manoah was not with her .
NIVUK	Judges	13	10	The woman hurried to tell her husband , ‘ He ’ s here ! The man who appeared to me the other day ! ’
NIVUK	Judges	13	11	Manoah got up and followed his wife . When he came to the man , he said , ‘ Are you the man who talked to my wife ? ’ ‘ I am , ’ he said .
NIVUK	Judges	13	12	So Manoah asked him , ‘ When your words are fulfilled , what is to be the rule that governs the boy ’ s life and work ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	13	14	She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine , nor drink any wine or other fermented drink nor eat anything unclean . She must do everything I have commanded her. ’
NIVUK	Judges	13	15	Manoah said to the angel of the Lord , ‘ We would like you to stay until we prepare a young goat for you. ’
NIVUK	Judges	13	16	The angel of the Lord replied , ‘ Even though you detain me , I will not eat any of your food . But if you prepare a burnt offering , offer it to the Lord. ’ ( Manoah did not realise that it was the angel of the Lord . )
NIVUK	Judges	13	17	Then Manoah enquired of the angel of the Lord , ‘ What is your name , so that we may honour you when your word comes true ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	13	18	He replied , ‘ Why do you ask my name ? It is beyond understanding . [ a ] ’
NIVUK	Judges	13	19	Then Manoah took a young goat , together with the grain offering , and sacrificed it on a rock to the Lord . And the Lord did an amazing thing while Manoah and his wife watched :
NIVUK	Judges	13	20	as the flame blazed up from the altar towards heaven , the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame . Seeing this , Manoah and his wife fell with their faces to the ground .
NIVUK	Judges	13	21	When the angel of the Lord did not show himself again to Manoah and his wife , Manoah realised that it was the angel of the Lord .
NIVUK	Judges	13	22	‘ We are doomed to die ! ’ he said to his wife . ‘ We have seen God ! ’
NIVUK	Judges	13	23	But his wife answered , ‘ If the Lord had meant to kill us , he would not have accepted a burnt offering and grain offering from our hands , nor shown us all these things or now told us this. ’
NIVUK	Judges	13	24	The woman gave birth to a boy and named him Samson . He grew and the Lord blessed him ,
NIVUK	Judges	13	25	and the Spirit of the Lord began to stir him while he was in Mahaneh Dan , between Zorah and Eshtaol . Footnotes - Judges 13:18 Or is wonderful Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Judges	14	14	He replied , ‘ Out of the eater , something to eat ; out of the strong , something sweet. ’ For three days they could not give the answer .
NIVUK	Judges	14	2	When he returned , he said to his father and mother , ‘ I have seen a Philistine woman in Timnah ; now get her for me as my wife. ’
NIVUK	Judges	14	3	His father and mother replied , ‘ Isn ’ t there an acceptable woman among your relatives or among all our people ? Must you go to the uncircumcised Philistines to get a wife ? ’ But Samson said to his father , ‘ Get her for me . She ’ s the right one for me. ’
NIVUK	Judges	14	4	( His parents did not know that this was from the Lord , who was seeking an occasion to confront the Philistines ; for at that time they were ruling over Israel . )
NIVUK	Judges	14	5	Samson went down to Timnah together with his father and mother . As they approached the vineyards of Timnah , suddenly a young lion came roaring towards him .
NIVUK	Judges	14	6	The Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him so that he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as he might have torn a young goat . But he told neither his father nor his mother what he had done .
NIVUK	Judges	14	7	Then he went down and talked with the woman , and he liked her .
NIVUK	Judges	14	8	Some time later , when he went back to marry her , he turned aside to look at the lion ’ s carcass , and in it he saw a swarm of bees and some honey .
NIVUK	Judges	14	9	He scooped out the honey with his hands and ate as he went along . When he rejoined his parents , he gave them some , and they too ate it . But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the lion ’ s carcass .
NIVUK	Judges	14	10	Now his father went down to see the woman . And there Samson held a feast , as was customary for young men .
NIVUK	Judges	14	11	When the people saw him , they chose thirty men to be his companions .
NIVUK	Judges	14	12	‘ Let me tell you a riddle , ’ Samson said to them . ‘ If you can give me the answer within the seven days of the feast , I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes .
NIVUK	Judges	14	13	If you can ’ t tell me the answer , you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes. ’ ‘ Tell us your riddle , ’ they said . ‘ Let ’ s hear it. ’
NIVUK	Judges	14	15	On the fourth [ a ] day , they said to Samson ’ s wife , ‘ Coax your husband into explaining the riddle for us , or we will burn you and your father ’ s household to death . Did you invite us here to steal our property ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	14	16	Then Samson ’ s wife threw herself on him , sobbing , ‘ You hate me ! You don ’ t really love me . You ’ ve given my people a riddle , but you haven ’ t told me the answer. ’ ‘ I haven ’ t even explained it to my father or mother , ’ he replied , ‘ so why should I explain it to you ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	14	17	She cried the whole seven days of the feast . So on the seventh day he finally told her , because she continued to press him . She in turn explained the riddle to her people .
NIVUK	Judges	14	18	Before sunset on the seventh day the men of the town said to him , ‘ What is sweeter than honey ? What is stronger than a lion ? ’ Samson said to them , ‘ If you had not ploughed with my heifer , you would not have solved my riddle. ’
NIVUK	Judges	14	19	Then the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him . He went down to Ashkelon , struck down thirty of their men , stripped them of everything and gave their clothes to those who had explained the riddle . Burning with anger , he returned to his father ’ s home .

NIVUK	Judges	15	15	Finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey , he grabbed it and struck down a thousand men .
NIVUK	Judges	15	2	‘ I was so sure you hated her , ’ he said , ‘ that I gave her to your companion . Isn ’ t her younger sister more attractive ? Take her instead. ’
NIVUK	Judges	15	3	Samson said to them , ‘ This time I have a right to get even with the Philistines ; I will really harm them. ’
NIVUK	Judges	15	4	So he went out and caught three hundred foxes and tied them tail to tail in pairs . He then fastened a torch to every pair of tails ,
NIVUK	Judges	15	5	lit the torches and let the foxes loose in the standing corn of the Philistines . He burned up the shocks and standing corn , together with the vineyards and olive groves .
NIVUK	Judges	15	6	When the Philistines asked , ‘ Who did this ? ’ they were told , ‘ Samson , the Timnite ’ s son-in-law , because his wife was given to his companion. ’ So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death .
NIVUK	Judges	15	7	Samson said to them , ‘ Since you ’ ve acted like this , I swear that I won ’ t stop until I get my revenge on you. ’
NIVUK	Judges	15	8	He attacked them viciously and slaughtered many of them . Then he went down and stayed in a cave in the rock of Etam .
NIVUK	Judges	15	9	The Philistines went up and camped in Judah , spreading out near Lehi .
NIVUK	Judges	15	10	The people of Judah asked , ‘ Why have you come to fight us ? ’ ‘ We have come to take Samson prisoner , ’ they answered , ‘ to do to him as he did to us. ’
NIVUK	Judges	15	11	Then three thousand men from Judah went down to the cave in the rock of Etam and said to Samson , ‘ Don ’ t you realise that the Philistines are rulers over us ? What have you done to us ? ’ He answered , ‘ I merely did to them what they did to me. ’
NIVUK	Judges	15	12	They said to him , ‘ We ’ ve come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines. ’ Samson said , ‘ Swear to me that you won ’ t kill me yourselves. ’
NIVUK	Judges	15	13	‘ Agreed , ’ they answered . ‘ We will only tie you up and hand you over to them . We will not kill you. ’ So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock .
NIVUK	Judges	15	14	As he approached Lehi , the Philistines came towards him shouting . The Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him . The ropes on his arms became like charred flax , and the bindings dropped from his hands .
NIVUK	Judges	15	16	Then Samson said , ‘ With a donkey ’ s jawbone I have made donkeys of them . [ a ] With a donkey ’ s jawbone I have killed a thousand men. ’
NIVUK	Judges	15	17	When he finished speaking , he threw away the jawbone ; and the place was called Ramath Lehi . [ b ]
NIVUK	Judges	15	18	Because he was very thirsty , he cried out to the Lord , ‘ You have given your servant this great victory . Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	15	19	Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi , and water came out of it . When Samson drank , his strength returned and he revived . So the spring was called En Hakkore , [ c ] and it is still there in Lehi .

NIVUK	Judges	16	2	The people of Gaza were told , ‘ Samson is here ! ’ So they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate . They made no move during the night , saying , ‘ At dawn we ’ ll kill him. ’
NIVUK	Judges	16	3	But Samson lay there only until the middle of the night . Then he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate , together with the two posts , and tore them loose , bar and all . He lifted them to his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron .
NIVUK	Judges	16	4	Some time later , he fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah .
NIVUK	Judges	16	5	The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said , ‘ See if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so that we may tie him up and subdue him . Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels [ a ] of silver. ’
NIVUK	Judges	16	6	So Delilah said to Samson , ‘ Tell me the secret of your great strength and how you can be tied up and subdued. ’
NIVUK	Judges	16	7	Samson answered her , ‘ If anyone ties me with seven fresh bow-strings that have not been dried , I ’ ll become as weak as any other man. ’
NIVUK	Judges	16	8	Then the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bow-strings that had not been dried , and she tied him with them .
NIVUK	Judges	16	9	With men hidden in the room , she called to him , ‘ Samson , the Philistines are upon you ! ’ But he snapped the bow-strings as easily as a piece of string snaps when it comes close to a flame . So the secret of his strength was not discovered .
NIVUK	Judges	16	10	Then Delilah said to Samson , ‘ You have made a fool of me ; you lied to me . Come now , tell me how you can be tied. ’
NIVUK	Judges	16	11	He said , ‘ If anyone ties me securely with new ropes that have never been used , I ’ ll become as weak as any other man. ’
NIVUK	Judges	16	12	So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them . Then , with men hidden in the room , she called to him , ‘ Samson , the Philistines are upon you ! ’ But he snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were threads .

NIVUK	Judges	16	17	So he told her everything . ‘ No razor has ever been used on my head , ’ he said , ‘ because I have been a Nazirite dedicated to God from my mother ’ s womb . If my head were shaved , my strength would leave me , and I would become as weak as any other man. ’
NIVUK	Judges	16	18	When Delilah saw that he had told her everything , she sent word to the rulers of the Philistines , ‘ Come back once more ; he has told me everything. ’ So the rulers of the Philistines returned with the silver in their hands .
NIVUK	Judges	16	19	After putting him to sleep on her lap , she called for someone to shave off the seven braids of his hair , and so began to subdue him . [ c ] And his strength left him .
NIVUK	Judges	16	20	Then she called , ‘ Samson , the Philistines are upon you ! ’ He awoke from his sleep and thought , ‘ I ’ ll go out as before and shake myself free. ’ But he did not know that the Lord had left him .
NIVUK	Judges	16	21	Then the Philistines seized him , gouged out his eyes and took him down to Gaza . Binding him with bronze shackles , they set him to grinding corn in the prison .
NIVUK	Judges	16	22	But the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved . The death of Samson
NIVUK	Judges	16	23	Now the rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate , saying , ‘ Our god has delivered Samson , our enemy , into our hands. ’

NIVUK	Judges	16	25	While they were in high spirits , they shouted , ‘ Bring out Samson to entertain us. ’ So they called Samson out of the prison , and he performed for them . When they stood him among the pillars ,

NIVUK	Judges	16	28	Then Samson prayed to the Lord , ‘ Sovereign Lord , remember me . Please , God , strengthen me just once more , and let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes. ’
NIVUK	Judges	16	29	Then Samson reached towards the two central pillars on which the temple stood . Bracing himself against them , his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other ,
NIVUK	Judges	16	30	Samson said , ‘ Let me die with the Philistines ! ’ Then he pushed with all his might , and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it . Thus he killed many more when he died than while he lived .

NIVUK	Judges	17	17	Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim
NIVUK	Judges	17	2	said to his mother , ‘ The eleven hundred shekels [ a ] of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse – I have that silver with me ; I took it. ’ Then his mother said , ‘ The Lord bless you , my son ! ’
NIVUK	Judges	17	3	When he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother , she said , ‘ I solemnly consecrate my silver to the Lord for my son to make an image overlaid with silver . I will give it back to you. ’
NIVUK	Judges	17	4	So after he returned the silver to his mother , she took two hundred shekels [ b ] of silver and gave them to a silversmith , who used them to make the idol . And it was put in Micah ’ s house .
NIVUK	Judges	17	5	Now this man Micah had a shrine , and he made an ephod and some household gods and installed one of his sons as his priest .
NIVUK	Judges	17	6	In those days Israel had no king ; everyone did as they saw fit .
NIVUK	Judges	17	7	A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah , who had been living within the clan of Judah ,
NIVUK	Judges	17	8	left that town in search of some other place to stay . On his way [ c ] he came to Micah ’ s house in the hill country of Ephraim .
NIVUK	Judges	17	9	Micah asked him , ‘ Where are you from ? ’ ‘ I ’ m a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah , ’ he said , ‘ and I ’ m looking for a place to stay. ’
NIVUK	Judges	17	10	Then Micah said to him , ‘ Live with me and be my father and priest , and I ’ ll give you ten shekels [ d ] of silver a year , your clothes and your food. ’
NIVUK	Judges	17	11	So the Levite agreed to live with him , and the young man became like one of his sons to him .

NIVUK	Judges	18	18	When the five men went into Micah ’ s house and took the idol , the ephod and the household gods , the priest said to them , ‘ What are you doing ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	18	2	So the Danites sent five of their leading men from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and explore it . These men represented all the Danites . They told them , ‘ Go , explore the land. ’ So they entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah , where they spent the night .
NIVUK	Judges	18	3	When they were near Micah ’ s house , they recognised the voice of the young Levite ; so they turned in there and asked him , ‘ Who brought you here ? What are you doing in this place ? Why are you here ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	18	4	He told them what Micah had done for him , and said , ‘ He has hired me and I am his priest. ’
NIVUK	Judges	18	5	Then they said to him , ‘ Please enquire of God to learn whether our journey will be successful. ’
NIVUK	Judges	18	6	The priest answered them , ‘ Go in peace . Your journey has the Lord ’ s approval. ’
NIVUK	Judges	18	7	So the five men left and came to Laish , where they saw that the people were living in safety , like the Sidonians , at peace and secure . And since their land lacked nothing , they were prosperous . [ a ] Also , they lived a long way from the Sidonians and had no relationship with anyone else . [ b ]
NIVUK	Judges	18	8	When they returned to Zorah and Eshtaol , their fellow Danites asked them , ‘ How did you find things ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	18	9	They answered , ‘ Come on , let ’ s attack them ! We have seen the land , and it is very good . Aren ’ t you going to do something ? Don ’ t hesitate to go there and take it over .
NIVUK	Judges	18	10	When you get there , you will find an unsuspecting people and a spacious land that God has put into your hands , a land that lacks nothing whatever. ’
NIVUK	Judges	18	11	Then six hundred men of the Danites , armed for battle , set out from Zorah and Eshtaol .
NIVUK	Judges	18	12	On their way they set up camp near Kiriath Jearim in Judah . This is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is called Mahaneh Dan [ c ] to this day .
NIVUK	Judges	18	13	From there they went on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah ’ s house .
NIVUK	Judges	18	14	Then the five men who had spied out the land of Laish said to their fellow Danites , ‘ Do you know that one of these houses has an ephod , some household gods and an image overlaid with silver ? Now you know what to do. ’
NIVUK	Judges	18	15	So they turned in there and went to the house of the young Levite at Micah ’ s place and greeted him .
NIVUK	Judges	18	16	The six hundred Danites , armed for battle , stood at the entrance of the gate .
NIVUK	Judges	18	17	The five men who had spied out the land went inside and took the idol , the ephod and the household gods while the priest and the six hundred armed men stood at the entrance of the gate .
NIVUK	Judges	18	19	They answered him , ‘ Be quiet ! Don ’ t say a word . Come with us , and be our father and priest . Isn ’ t it better that you serve a tribe and clan in Israel as priest rather than just one man ’ s household ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	18	20	The priest was very pleased . He took the ephod , the household gods and the idol and went along with the people .
NIVUK	Judges	18	21	Putting their little children , their livestock and their possessions in front of them , they turned away and left .
NIVUK	Judges	18	22	When they had gone some distance from Micah ’ s house , the men who lived near Micah were called together and overtook the Danites .
NIVUK	Judges	18	23	As they shouted after them , the Danites turned and said to Micah , ‘ What ’ s the matter with you that you called out your men to fight ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	18	24	He replied , ‘ You took the gods I made , and my priest , and went away . What else do I have ? How can you ask , “ What ’ s the matter with you ? ” ’
NIVUK	Judges	18	25	The Danites answered , ‘ Don ’ t argue with us , or some of the men may get angry and attack you , and you and your family will lose your lives. ’
NIVUK	Judges	18	26	So the Danites went their way , and Micah , seeing that they were too strong for him , turned round and went back home .
NIVUK	Judges	18	27	Then they took what Micah had made , and his priest , and went on to Laish , against a people at peace and secure . They attacked them with the sword and burned down their city .
NIVUK	Judges	18	28	There was no one to rescue them because they lived a long way from Sidon and had no relationship with anyone else . The city was in a valley near Beth Rehob . The Danites rebuilt the city and settled there .
NIVUK	Judges	18	29	They named it Dan after their ancestor Dan , who was born to Israel – though the city used to be called Laish .
NIVUK	Judges	18	30	There the Danites set up for themselves the idol , and Jonathan son of Gershom , the son of Moses , [ d ] and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the time of the captivity of the land .
NIVUK	Judges	18	31	They continued to use the idol Micah had made , all the time the house of God was in Shiloh .

NIVUK	Judges	19	19	We have both straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves your servants – me , the woman and the young man with us . We don ’ t need anything. ’
NIVUK	Judges	19	2	But she was unfaithful to him . She left him and went back to her parents ’ home in Bethlehem , Judah . After she had been there for four months ,
NIVUK	Judges	19	3	her husband went to her to persuade her to return . He had with him his servant and two donkeys . She took him into her parents ’ home , and when her father saw him , he gladly welcomed him .
NIVUK	Judges	19	4	His father-in-law , the woman ’ s father , prevailed on him to stay ; so he remained with him three days , eating and drinking , and sleeping there .
NIVUK	Judges	19	5	On the fourth day they got up early and he prepared to leave , but the woman ’ s father said to his son-in-law , ‘ Refresh yourself with something to eat ; then you can go. ’
NIVUK	Judges	19	6	So the two of them sat down to eat and drink together . Afterwards the woman ’ s father said , ‘ Please stay tonight and enjoy yourself. ’
NIVUK	Judges	19	7	And when the man got up to go , his father-in-law persuaded him , so he stayed there that night .
NIVUK	Judges	19	8	On the morning of the fifth day , when he rose to go , the woman ’ s father said , ‘ Refresh yourself . Wait till afternoon ! ’ So the two of them ate together .
NIVUK	Judges	19	9	Then when the man , with his concubine and his servant , got up to leave , his father-in-law , the woman ’ s father , said , ‘ Now look , it ’ s almost evening . Spend the night here ; the day is nearly over . Stay and enjoy yourself . Early tomorrow morning you can get up and be on your way home. ’
NIVUK	Judges	19	10	But , unwilling to stay another night , the man left and went towards Jebus ( that is , Jerusalem ) , with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine .
NIVUK	Judges	19	11	When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone , the servant said to his master , ‘ Come , let ’ s stop at this city of the Jebusites and spend the night. ’
NIVUK	Judges	19	12	His master replied , ‘ No . We won ’ t go into any city whose people are not Israelites . We will go on to Gibeah. ’
NIVUK	Judges	19	13	He added , ‘ Come , let ’ s try to reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night in one of those places. ’
NIVUK	Judges	19	14	So they went on , and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin .
NIVUK	Judges	19	15	There they stopped to spend the night . They went and sat in the city square , but no one took them in for the night .
NIVUK	Judges	19	16	That evening an old man from the hill country of Ephraim , who was living in Gibeah ( the inhabitants of the place were Benjaminites ) , came in from his work in the fields .
NIVUK	Judges	19	17	When he looked and saw the traveller in the city square , the old man asked , ‘ Where are you going ? Where did you come from ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	19	18	He answered , ‘ We are on our way from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim where I live . I have been to Bethlehem in Judah and now I am going to the house of the Lord . [ a ] No one has taken me in for the night .
NIVUK	Judges	19	20	‘ You are welcome at my house , ’ the old man said . ‘ Let me supply whatever you need . Only don ’ t spend the night in the square. ’
NIVUK	Judges	19	21	So he took him into his house and fed his donkeys . After they had washed their feet , they had something to eat and drink .
NIVUK	Judges	19	22	While they were enjoying themselves , some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house . Pounding on the door , they shouted to the old man who owned the house , ‘ Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him. ’
NIVUK	Judges	19	23	The owner of the house went outside and said to them , ‘ No , my friends , don ’ t be so vile . Since this man is my guest , don ’ t do this outrageous thing .
NIVUK	Judges	19	24	Look , here is my virgin daughter , and his concubine . I will bring them out to you now , and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish . But as for this man , don ’ t do such an outrageous thing. ’
NIVUK	Judges	19	25	But the men would not listen to him . So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them , and they raped her and abused her throughout the night , and at dawn they let her go .
NIVUK	Judges	19	26	At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying , fell down at the door and lay there until daylight .
NIVUK	Judges	19	27	When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way , there lay his concubine , fallen in the doorway of the house , with her hands on the threshold .
NIVUK	Judges	19	28	He said to her , ‘ Get up ; let ’ s go. ’ But there was no answer . Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home .
NIVUK	Judges	19	29	When he reached home , he took a knife and cut up his concubine , limb by limb , into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel .
NIVUK	Judges	19	30	Everyone who saw it was saying to one another , ‘ Such a thing has never been seen or done , not since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt . Just imagine ! We must do something ! So speak up ! ’ Footnotes - Judges 19:18 Hebrew , Vulgate , Syriac and Targum ; Septuagint going home Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Judges	20	20	The Israelites went out to fight the Benjaminites and took up battle positions against them at Gibeah .
NIVUK	Judges	20	2	The leaders of all the people of the tribes of Israel took their places in the assembly of God ’ s people , four hundred thousand men armed with swords .
NIVUK	Judges	20	3	( The Benjaminites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah . ) Then the Israelites said , ‘ Tell us how this awful thing happened. ’
NIVUK	Judges	20	4	So the Levite , the husband of the murdered woman , said , ‘ I and my concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night .
NIVUK	Judges	20	5	During the night the men of Gibeah came after me and surrounded the house , intending to kill me . They raped my concubine , and she died .
NIVUK	Judges	20	6	I took my concubine , cut her into pieces and sent one piece to each region of Israel ’ s inheritance , because they committed this lewd and outrageous act in Israel .
NIVUK	Judges	20	7	Now , all you Israelites , speak up and tell me what you have decided to do. ’
NIVUK	Judges	20	8	All the men rose up together as one , saying , ‘ None of us will go home . No , not one of us will return to his house .
NIVUK	Judges	20	9	But now this is what we ’ ll do to Gibeah : we ’ ll go up against it in the order decided by casting lots .
NIVUK	Judges	20	10	We ’ ll take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel , and a hundred from a thousand , and a thousand from ten thousand , to get provisions for the army . Then , when the army arrives at Gibeah [ a ] in Benjamin , it can give them what they deserve for this outrageous act done in Israel. ’
NIVUK	Judges	20	11	So all the Israelites got together and united as one against the city .
NIVUK	Judges	20	12	The tribes of Israel sent messengers throughout the tribe of Benjamin , saying , ‘ What about this awful crime that was committed among you ?
NIVUK	Judges	20	13	Now turn those wicked men of Gibeah over to us so that we may put them to death and purge the evil from Israel. ’ But the Benjaminites would not listen to their fellow Israelites .
NIVUK	Judges	20	14	From their towns they came together at Gibeah to fight against the Israelites .
NIVUK	Judges	20	15	At once the Benjaminites mobilised twenty-six thousand swordsmen from their towns , in addition to seven hundred able young men from those living in Gibeah .
NIVUK	Judges	20	16	Among all these soldiers there were seven hundred select troops who were left-handed , each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss .
NIVUK	Judges	20	17	Israel , apart from Benjamin , mustered four hundred thousand swordsmen , all of them fit for battle .
NIVUK	Judges	20	18	The Israelites went up to Bethel [ b ] and enquired of God . They said , ‘ Who of us is to go up first to fight against the Benjaminites ? ’ The Lord replied , ‘ Judah shall go first. ’
NIVUK	Judges	20	19	The next morning the Israelites got up and pitched camp near Gibeah .
NIVUK	Judges	20	21	The Benjaminites came out of Gibeah and cut down twenty-two thousand Israelites on the battlefield that day .
NIVUK	Judges	20	22	But the Israelites encouraged one another and again took up their positions where they had stationed themselves the first day .
NIVUK	Judges	20	23	The Israelites went up and wept before the Lord until evening , and they enquired of the Lord . They said , ‘ Shall we go up again to fight against the Benjaminites , our fellow Israelites ? ’ The Lord answered , ‘ Go up against them. ’
NIVUK	Judges	20	24	Then the Israelites drew near to Benjamin the second day .
NIVUK	Judges	20	25	This time , when the Benjaminites came out from Gibeah to oppose them , they cut down another eighteen thousand Israelites , all of them armed with swords .

NIVUK	Judges	20	27	And the Israelites enquired of the Lord . ( In those days the ark of the covenant of God was there ,
NIVUK	Judges	20	28	with Phinehas son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron , ministering before it . ) They asked , ‘ Shall we go up again to fight against the Benjaminites , our fellow Israelites , or not ? ’ The Lord responded , ‘ Go , for tomorrow I will give them into your hands. ’
NIVUK	Judges	20	29	Then Israel set an ambush around Gibeah .
NIVUK	Judges	20	30	They went up against the Benjaminites on the third day and took up positions against Gibeah as they had done before .
NIVUK	Judges	20	31	The Benjaminites came out to meet them and were drawn away from the city . They began to inflict casualties on the Israelites as before , so that about thirty men fell in the open field and on the roads – the one leading to Bethel and the other to Gibeah .
NIVUK	Judges	20	32	While the Benjaminites were saying , ‘ We are defeating them as before , ’ the Israelites were saying , ‘ Let ’ s retreat and draw them away from the city to the roads. ’
NIVUK	Judges	20	33	All the men of Israel moved from their places and took up positions at Baal Tamar , and the Israelite ambush charged out of its place on the west [ c ] of Gibeah . [ d ]
NIVUK	Judges	20	34	Then ten thousand of Israel ’ s able young men made a frontal attack on Gibeah . The fighting was so heavy that the Benjaminites did not realise how near disaster was .
NIVUK	Judges	20	35	The Lord defeated Benjamin before Israel , and on that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 Benjaminites , all armed with swords .
NIVUK	Judges	20	36	Then the Benjaminites saw that they were beaten . Now the men of Israel had given way before Benjamin , because they relied on the ambush they had set near Gibeah .
NIVUK	Judges	20	37	Those who had been in ambush made a sudden dash into Gibeah , spread out and put the whole city to the sword .
NIVUK	Judges	20	38	The Israelites had arranged with the ambush that they should send up a great cloud of smoke from the city ,
NIVUK	Judges	20	39	and then the Israelites would counterattack . The Benjaminites had begun to inflict casualties on the Israelites ( about thirty ) , and they said , ‘ We are defeating them as in the first battle. ’
NIVUK	Judges	20	40	But when the column of smoke began to rise from the city , the Benjaminites turned and saw the whole city going up in smoke .
NIVUK	Judges	20	41	Then the Israelites counterattacked , and the Benjaminites were terrified , because they realised that disaster had come on them .
NIVUK	Judges	20	42	So they fled before the Israelites in the direction of the wilderness , but they could not escape the battle . And the Israelites who came out of the towns cut them down there .
NIVUK	Judges	20	43	They surrounded the Benjaminites , chased them and easily [ e ] overran them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east .
NIVUK	Judges	20	44	Eighteen thousand Benjaminites fell , all of them valiant fighters .
NIVUK	Judges	20	45	As they turned and fled towards the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon , the Israelites cut down five thousand men along the roads . They kept pressing after the Benjaminites as far as Gidom and struck down two thousand more .
NIVUK	Judges	20	46	On that day twenty-five thousand Benjaminite swordsmen fell , all of them valiant fighters .
NIVUK	Judges	20	47	But six hundred of them turned and fled into the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon , where they stayed for four months .
NIVUK	Judges	20	48	The men of Israel went back to Benjamin and put all the towns to the sword , including the animals and everything else they found . All the towns they came across they set on fire .

NIVUK	Judges	21	21	and watch . When the young women of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing , rush from the vineyards and each of you seize one of them to be your wife . Then return to the land of Benjamin .
NIVUK	Judges	21	2	The people went to Bethel , [ a ] where they sat before God until evening , raising their voices and weeping bitterly .
NIVUK	Judges	21	3	‘ Lord , God of Israel , ’ they cried , ‘ why has this happened to Israel ? Why should one tribe be missing from Israel today ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	21	4	Early the next day the people built an altar and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings .
NIVUK	Judges	21	5	Then the Israelites asked , ‘ Who from all the tribes of Israel has failed to assemble before the Lord ? ’ For they had taken a solemn oath that anyone who failed to assemble before the Lord at Mizpah was to be put to death .
NIVUK	Judges	21	6	Now the Israelites grieved for the tribe of Benjamin , their fellow Israelites . ‘ Today one tribe is cut off from Israel , ’ they said .
NIVUK	Judges	21	7	‘ How can we provide wives for those who are left , since we have taken an oath by the Lord not to give them any of our daughters in marriage ? ’
NIVUK	Judges	21	8	Then they asked , ‘ Which one of the tribes of Israel failed to assemble before the Lord at Mizpah ? ’ They discovered that no one from Jabesh Gilead had come to the camp for the assembly .
NIVUK	Judges	21	9	For when they counted the people , they found that none of the people of Jabesh Gilead were there .
NIVUK	Judges	21	10	So the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there , including the women and children .
NIVUK	Judges	21	11	‘ This is what you are to do , ’ they said . ‘ Kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin. ’
NIVUK	Judges	21	12	They found among the people living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man , and they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan .
NIVUK	Judges	21	13	Then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the Benjaminites at the rock of Rimmon .
NIVUK	Judges	21	14	So the Benjaminites returned at that time and were given the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared . But there were not enough for all of them .
NIVUK	Judges	21	15	The people grieved for Benjamin , because the Lord had made a gap in the tribes of Israel .
NIVUK	Judges	21	16	And the elders of the assembly said , ‘ With the women of Benjamin destroyed , how shall we provide wives for the men who are left ?
NIVUK	Judges	21	17	The Benjaminite survivors must have heirs , ’ they said , ‘ so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out .
NIVUK	Judges	21	18	We can ’ t give them our daughters as wives , since we Israelites have taken this oath : “ Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjaminite. ”
NIVUK	Judges	21	19	But look , there is the annual festival of the Lord in Shiloh , which lies north of Bethel , east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem , and south of Lebonah. ’
NIVUK	Judges	21	20	So they instructed the Benjaminites , saying , ‘ Go and hide in the vineyards
NIVUK	Judges	21	22	When their fathers or brothers complain to us , we will say to them , “ Do us the favour of helping them , because we did not get wives for them during the war . You will not be guilty of breaking your oath because you did not give your daughters to them. ” ’
NIVUK	Judges	21	23	So that is what the Benjaminites did . While the young women were dancing , each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife . Then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them .
NIVUK	Judges	21	24	At that time the Israelites left that place and went home to their tribes and clans , each to his own inheritance .

NIVUK	Ruth	1	1	In the days when the judges ruled , [ a ] there was a famine in the land . So a man from Bethlehem in Judah , together with his wife and two sons , went to live for a while in the country of Moab .
NIVUK	Ruth	1	2	The man ’ s name was Elimelek , his wife ’ s name was Naomi , and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion . They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem , Judah . And they went to Moab and lived there .
NIVUK	Ruth	1	3	Now Elimelek , Naomi ’ s husband , died , and she was left with her two sons .
NIVUK	Ruth	1	4	They married Moabite women , one named Orpah and the other Ruth . After they had lived there about ten years ,
NIVUK	Ruth	1	5	both Mahlon and Kilion also died , and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband . Naomi and Ruth return to Bethlehem
NIVUK	Ruth	1	6	When Naomi heard in Moab that the Lord had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them , she and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there .
NIVUK	Ruth	1	7	With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah .
NIVUK	Ruth	1	8	Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law , ‘ Go back , each of you , to your mother ’ s home . May the Lord show you kindness , as you have shown kindness to your dead husbands and to me .
NIVUK	Ruth	1	9	May the Lord grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband. ’ Then she kissed them goodbye and they wept aloud
NIVUK	Ruth	1	10	and said to her , ‘ We will go back with you to your people. ’
NIVUK	Ruth	1	11	But Naomi said , ‘ Return home , my daughters . Why would you come with me ? Am I going to have any more sons , who could become your husbands ?
NIVUK	Ruth	1	12	Return home , my daughters ; I am too old to have another husband . Even if I thought there was still hope for me – even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons –
NIVUK	Ruth	1	13	would you wait until they grew up ? Would you remain unmarried for them ? No , my daughters . It is more bitter for me than for you , because the Lord ’ s hand has turned against me ! ’
NIVUK	Ruth	1	14	At this they wept aloud again . Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye , but Ruth clung to her .
NIVUK	Ruth	1	15	‘ Look , ’ said Naomi , ‘ your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods . Go back with her. ’
NIVUK	Ruth	1	16	But Ruth replied , ‘ Don ’ t urge me to leave you or to turn back from you . Where you go I will go , and where you stay I will stay . Your people will be my people and your God my God .
NIVUK	Ruth	1	17	Where you die I will die , and there I will be buried . May the Lord deal with me , be it ever so severely , if even death separates you and me. ’
NIVUK	Ruth	1	18	When Naomi realised that Ruth was determined to go with her , she stopped urging her .
NIVUK	Ruth	1	19	So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem . When they arrived in Bethlehem , the whole town was stirred because of them , and the women exclaimed , ‘ Can this be Naomi ? ’
NIVUK	Ruth	1	20	‘ Don ’ t call me Naomi , ’ [ b ] she told them . ‘ Call me Mara , [ c ] because the Almighty [ d ] has made my life very bitter .
NIVUK	Ruth	1	21	I went away full , but the Lord has brought me back empty . Why call me Naomi ? The Lord has afflicted [ e ] me ; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me. ’
NIVUK	Ruth	1	22	So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabite , her daughter-in-law , arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Ruth	2	2	And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi , ‘ Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favour. ’ Naomi said to her , ‘ Go ahead , my daughter. ’
NIVUK	Ruth	2	3	So she went out , entered a field and began to glean behind the harvesters . As it turned out , she was working in a field belonging to Boaz , who was from the clan of Elimelek .
NIVUK	Ruth	2	4	Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters , ‘ The Lord be with you ! ’ ‘ The Lord bless you ! ’ they answered .
NIVUK	Ruth	2	5	Boaz asked the overseer of his harvesters , ‘ Who does that young woman belong to ? ’
NIVUK	Ruth	2	6	The overseer replied , ‘ She is the Moabite who came back from Moab with Naomi .
NIVUK	Ruth	2	7	She said , “ Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters. ” She came into the field and has remained here from morning till now , except for a short rest in the shelter. ’
NIVUK	Ruth	2	8	So Boaz said to Ruth , ‘ My daughter , listen to me . Don ’ t go and glean in another field and don ’ t go away from here . Stay here with the women who work for me .
NIVUK	Ruth	2	9	Watch the field where the men are harvesting , and follow along after the women . I have told the men not to lay a hand on you . And whenever you are thirsty , go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled. ’
NIVUK	Ruth	2	10	At this , she bowed down with her face to the ground . She asked him , ‘ Why have I found such favour in your eyes that you notice me – a foreigner ? ’
NIVUK	Ruth	2	11	Boaz replied , ‘ I ’ ve been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband – how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before .
NIVUK	Ruth	2	12	May the Lord repay you for what you have done . May you be richly rewarded by the Lord , the God of Israel , under whose wings you have come to take refuge. ’
NIVUK	Ruth	2	13	‘ May I continue to find favour in your eyes , my lord , ’ she said . ‘ You have put me at ease by speaking kindly to your servant – though I do not have the standing of one of your servants. ’
NIVUK	Ruth	2	14	At mealtime Boaz said to her , ‘ Come over here . Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar. ’ When she sat down with the harvesters , he offered her some roasted grain . She ate all she wanted and had some left over .
NIVUK	Ruth	2	15	As she got up to glean , Boaz gave orders to his men , ‘ Let her gather among the sheaves and don ’ t reprimand her .
NIVUK	Ruth	2	16	Even pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up , and don ’ t rebuke her. ’
NIVUK	Ruth	2	17	So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening . Then she threshed the barley she had gathered , and it amounted to about an ephah . [ a ]
NIVUK	Ruth	2	18	She carried it back to town , and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered . Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough .
NIVUK	Ruth	2	19	Her mother-in-law asked her , ‘ Where did you glean today ? Where did you work ? Blessed be the man who took notice of you ! ’ Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working . ‘ The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz , ’ she said .
NIVUK	Ruth	2	20	‘ The Lord bless him ! ’ Naomi said to her daughter-in-law . ‘ He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead. ’ She added , ‘ That man is our close relative ; he is one of our guardian-redeemers . [ b ] ’
NIVUK	Ruth	2	21	Then Ruth the Moabite said , ‘ He even said to me , “ Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain. ” ’
NIVUK	Ruth	2	22	Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law , ‘ It will be good for you , my daughter , to go with the women who work for him , because in someone else ’ s field you might be harmed. ’
NIVUK	Ruth	2	23	So Ruth stayed close to the women of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished . And she lived with her mother-in-law . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	1	4	Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice , he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	1	5	But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her , and the Lord had closed her womb .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	1	6	Because the Lord had closed Hannah ’ s womb , her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	1	7	This went on year after year . Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the Lord , her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	1	8	Her husband Elkanah would say to her , ‘ Hannah , why are you weeping ? Why don ’ t you eat ? Why are you downhearted ? Don ’ t I mean more to you than ten sons ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	1	9	Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh , Hannah stood up . Now Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the Lord ’ s house .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	1	10	In her deep anguish Hannah prayed to the Lord , weeping bitterly .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	1	11	And she made a vow , saying , ‘ Lord Almighty , if you will only look on your servant ’ s misery and remember me , and not forget your servant but give her a son , then I will give him to the Lord for all the days of his life , and no razor will ever be used on his head. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	1	12	As she kept on praying to the Lord , Eli observed her mouth .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	1	13	Hannah was praying in her heart , and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard . Eli thought she was drunk
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	1	14	and said to her , ‘ How long are you going to stay drunk ? Put away your wine. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	1	15	‘ Not so , my lord , ’ Hannah replied , ‘ I am a woman who is deeply troubled . I have not been drinking wine or beer ; I was pouring out my soul to the Lord .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	1	18	She said , ‘ May your servant find favour in your eyes. ’ Then she went her way and ate something , and her face was no longer downcast .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	1	19	Early the next morning they arose and worshipped before the Lord and then went back to their home at Ramah . Elkanah made love to his wife Hannah , and the Lord remembered her .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	1	20	So in the course of time Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son . She named him Samuel , [ b ] saying , ‘ Because I asked the Lord for him. ’ Hannah dedicates Samuel
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	1	21	When her husband Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the Lord and to fulfil his vow ,
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	1	22	Hannah did not go . She said to her husband , ‘ After the boy is weaned , I will take him and present him before the Lord , and he will live there always. ’ [ c ]

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	11	Then Elkanah went home to Ramah , but the boy ministered before the Lord under Eli the priest . Eli ’ s wicked sons
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	12	Eli ’ s sons were scoundrels ; they had no regard for the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	13	Now it was the practice of the priests that , whenever any of the people offered a sacrifice , the priest ’ s servant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand while the meat was being boiled
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	14	and would plunge the fork into the pan or kettle or cauldron or pot . Whatever the fork brought up the priest would take for himself . This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	15	But even before the fat was burned , the priest ’ s servant would come and say to the person who was sacrificing , ‘ Give the priest some meat to roast ; he won ’ t accept boiled meat from you , but only raw. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	16	If the person said to him , ‘ Let the fat be burned first , and then take whatever you want , ’ the servant would answer , ‘ No , hand it over now ; if you don ’ t , I ’ ll take it by force. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	17	This sin of the young men was very great in the Lord ’ s sight , for they [ b ] were treating the Lord ’ s offering with contempt .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	18	But Samuel was ministering before the Lord – a boy wearing a linen ephod .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	19	Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	20	Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife , saying , ‘ May the Lord give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to [ c ] the Lord. ’ Then they would go home .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	21	And the Lord was gracious to Hannah ; she gave birth to three sons and two daughters . Meanwhile , the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	22	Now Eli , who was very old , heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	23	So he said to them , ‘ Why do you do such things ? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	24	No , my sons ; the report I hear spreading among the Lord ’ s people is not good .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	25	If one person sins against another , God [ d ] may mediate for the offender ; but if anyone sins against the Lord , who will intercede for them ? ’ His sons , however , did not listen to their father ’ s rebuke , for it was the Lord ’ s will to put them to death .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	26	And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favour with the Lord and with people . Prophecy against the house of Eli
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	27	Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him , ‘ This is what the Lord says : “ Did I not clearly reveal myself to your ancestor ’ s family when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh ?
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	28	I chose your ancestor out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest , to go up to my altar , to burn incense , and to wear an ephod in my presence . I also gave your ancestor ’ s family all the food offerings presented by the Israelites .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	29	Why do you [ e ] scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling ? Why do you honour your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel ? ”
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	30	‘ Therefore the Lord , the God of Israel , declares : “ I promised that members of your family would minister before me for ever. ” But now the Lord declares : “ Far be it from me ! Those who honour me I will honour , but those who despise me will be disdained .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	32	and you will see distress in my dwelling . Although good will be done to Israel , no one in your family line will ever reach old age .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	33	Every one of you that I do not cut off from serving at my altar I will spare only to destroy your sight and sap your strength , and all your descendants will die in the prime of life .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	34	‘ “ And what happens to your two sons , Hophni and Phinehas , will be a sign to you – they will both die on the same day .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	2	35	I will raise up for myself a faithful priest , who will do according to what is in my heart and mind . I will firmly establish his priestly house , and they will minister before my anointed one always .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	3	3	The lamp of God had not yet gone out , and Samuel was lying down in the house of the Lord , where the ark of God was .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	3	2	One night Eli , whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see , was lying down in his usual place .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	3	4	Then the Lord called Samuel . Samuel answered , ‘ Here I am. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	3	5	And he ran to Eli and said , ‘ Here I am ; you called me. ’ But Eli said , ‘ I did not call ; go back and lie down. ’ So he went and lay down .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	3	9	So Eli told Samuel , ‘ Go and lie down , and if he calls you , say , “ Speak , Lord , for your servant is listening. ” ’ So Samuel went and lay down in his place .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	3	10	The Lord came and stood there , calling as at the other times , ‘ Samuel ! Samuel ! ’ Then Samuel said , ‘ Speak , for your servant is listening. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	3	11	And the Lord said to Samuel : ‘ See , I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears about it tingle .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	3	12	At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family – from beginning to end .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	3	13	For I told him that I would judge his family for ever because of the sin he knew about ; his sons uttered blasphemies against God , [ a ] and he failed to restrain them .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	3	14	Therefore I swore to the house of Eli , “ The guilt of Eli ’ s house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	3	15	Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the Lord . He was afraid to tell Eli the vision ,

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	4	3	When the soldiers returned to camp , the elders of Israel asked , ‘ Why did the Lord bring defeat on us today before the Philistines ? Let us bring the ark of the Lord ’ s covenant from Shiloh , so that he may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	4	5	When the ark of the Lord ’ s covenant came into the camp , all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	1	Samuel 6:19 A few Hebrew manuscripts ; most Hebrew manuscripts and Septuagint 50,070 Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	6	Why do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did ? When Israel ’ s god dealt harshly with them , did they not send the Israelites out so that they could go on their way ?
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	2	the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said , ‘ What shall we do with the ark of the Lord ? Tell us how we should send it back to its place. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	3	They answered , ‘ If you return the ark of the god of Israel , do not send it back to him without a gift ; by all means send a guilt offering to him . Then you will be healed , and you will know why his hand has not been lifted from you. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	4	The Philistines asked , ‘ What guilt offering should we send to him ? ’ They replied , ‘ Five gold tumours and five gold rats , according to the number of the Philistine rulers , because the same plague has struck both you and your rulers .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	5	Make models of the tumours and of the rats that are destroying the country , and give glory to Israel ’ s god . Perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	7	‘ Now then , get a new cart ready , with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked . Hitch the cows to the cart , but take their calves away and pen them up .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	8	Take the ark of the Lord and put it on the cart , and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to him as a guilt offering . Send it on its way ,
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	9	but keep watching it . If it goes up to its own territory , towards Beth Shemesh , then the Lord has brought this great disaster on us . But if it does not , then we shall know that it was not his hand that struck us but that it happened to us by chance. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	10	So they did this . They took two such cows and hitched them to the cart and penned up their calves .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	11	They placed the ark of the Lord on the cart and along with it the chest containing the gold rats and the models of the tumours .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	12	Then the cows went straight up towards Beth Shemesh , keeping on the road and lowing all the way ; they did not turn to the right or to the left . The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	13	Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley , and when they looked up and saw the ark , they rejoiced at the sight .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	14	The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh , and there it stopped beside a large rock . The people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	15	The Levites took down the ark of the Lord , together with the chest containing the gold objects , and placed them on the large rock . On that day the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	16	The five rulers of the Philistines saw all this and then returned that same day to Ekron .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	17	These are the gold tumours the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to the Lord – one each for Ashdod , Gaza , Ashkelon , Gath and Ekron .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	18	And the number of the gold rats was according to the number of Philistine towns belonging to the five rulers – the fortified towns with their country villages . The large rock on which the Levites set the ark of the Lord is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	19	But God struck down some of the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh , putting seventy [ a ] of them to death because they looked into the ark of the Lord . The people mourned because of the heavy blow the Lord had dealt them .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	20	And the people of Beth Shemesh asked , ‘ Who can stand in the presence of the Lord , this holy God ? To whom will the ark go up from here ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	6	21	Then they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath Jearim , saying , ‘ The Philistines have returned the ark of the Lord . Come down and take it up to your town. ’ Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	7	9	Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and sacrificed it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord . He cried out to the Lord on Israel ’ s behalf , and the Lord answered him .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	7	10	While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering , the Philistines drew near to engage Israel in battle . But that day the Lord thundered with loud thunder against the Philistines and threw them into such a panic that they were routed before the Israelites .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	7	11	The men of Israel rushed out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines , slaughtering them along the way to a point below Beth Kar .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	7	12	Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen . He named it Ebenezer , [ b ] saying , ‘ Thus far the Lord has helped us. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	7	13	So the Philistines were subdued and they stopped invading Israel ’ s territory . Throughout Samuel ’ s lifetime , the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	7	14	The towns from Ekron to Gath that the Philistines had captured from Israel were restored to Israel , and Israel delivered the neighbouring territory from the hands of the Philistines . And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	8	8	As they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day , forsaking me and serving other gods , so they are doing to you .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	8	2	The name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second was Abijah , and they served at Beersheba .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	8	3	But his sons did not follow his ways . They turned aside after dishonest gain and accepted bribes and perverted justice .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	8	4	So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	8	5	They said to him , ‘ You are old , and your sons do not follow your ways ; now appoint a king to lead [ b ] us , such as all the other nations have. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	8	6	and
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	8	7	And the Lord told him : ‘ Listen to all that the people are saying to you ; it is not you they have rejected , but they have rejected me as their king .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	8	9	Now listen to them ; but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will claim as his rights. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	8	10	Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people who were asking him for a king .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	8	11	He said , ‘ This is what the king who will reign over you will claim as his rights : he will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses , and they will run in front of his chariots .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	8	12	Some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties , and others to plough his ground and reap his harvest , and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	8	13	He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	8	17	He will take a tenth of your flocks , and you yourselves will become his slaves .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	8	18	When that day comes , you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen , but the Lord will not answer you in that day. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	8	19	But the people refused to listen to Samuel . ‘ No ! ’ they said . ‘ We want a king over us .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	2	Kish had a son named Saul , as handsome a young man as could be found anywhere in Israel , and he was a head taller than anyone else .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	3	grams Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	4	So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha , but they did not find them . They went on into the district of Shaalim , but the donkeys were not there . Then he passed through the territory of Benjamin , but they did not find them .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	5	When they reached the district of Zuph , Saul said to the servant who was with him , ‘ Come , let ’ s go back , or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	6	But the servant replied , ‘ Look , in this town there is a man of God ; he is highly respected , and everything he says comes true . Let ’ s go there now . Perhaps he will tell us what way to take. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	7	Saul said to his servant , ‘ If we go , what can we give the man ? The food in our sacks is gone . We have no gift to take to the man of God . What do we have ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	8	The servant answered him again . ‘ Look , ’ he said , ‘ I have a quarter of a shekel [ a ] of silver . I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us what way to take. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	10	‘ Good , ’ Saul said to his servant . ‘ Come , let ’ s go. ’ So they set out for the town where the man of God was .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	11	As they were going up the hill to the town , they met some young women coming out to draw water , and they asked them , ‘ Is the seer here ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	12	‘ He is , ’ they answered . ‘ He ’ s ahead of you . Hurry now ; he has just come to our town today , for the people have a sacrifice at the high place .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	13	As soon as you enter the town , you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat . The people will not begin eating until he comes , because he must bless the sacrifice ; afterwards , those who are invited will eat . Go up now ; you should find him about this time. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	14	They went up to the town , and as they were entering it , there was Samuel , coming towards them on his way up to the high place .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	15	Now the day before Saul came , the Lord had revealed this to Samuel :
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	16	‘ About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin . Anoint him ruler over my people Israel ; he will deliver them from the hand of the Philistines . I have looked on my people , for their cry has reached me. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	17	When Samuel caught sight of Saul , the Lord said to him , ‘ This is the man I spoke to you about ; he will govern my people. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	18	Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked , ‘ Would you please tell me where the seer ’ s house is ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	19	‘ I am the seer , ’ Samuel replied . ‘ Go up ahead of me to the high place , for today you are to eat with me , and in the morning I will send you on your way and will tell you all that is in your heart .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	20	As for the donkeys you lost three days ago , do not worry about them ; they have been found . And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned , if not to you and your whole family line ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	21	Saul answered , ‘ But am I not a Benjaminite , from the smallest tribe of Israel , and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin ? Why do you say such a thing to me ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	22	Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and seated them at the head of those who were invited – about thirty in number .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	23	Samuel said to the cook , ‘ Bring the piece of meat I gave you , the one I told you to lay aside. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	24	So the cook took up the thigh with what was on it and set it in front of Saul . Samuel said , ‘ Here is what has been kept for you . Eat , because it was set aside for you for this occasion from the time I said , “ I have invited guests. ” ’ And Saul dined with Samuel that day .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	25	After they came down from the high place to the town , Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	26	They rose about daybreak , and Samuel called to Saul on the roof , ‘ Get ready , and I will send you on your way. ’ When Saul got ready , he and Samuel went outside together .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	9	27	As they were going down to the edge of the town , Samuel said to Saul , ‘ Tell the servant to go on ahead of us ’ – and the servant did so – ‘ but you stay here for a while , so that I may give you a message from God. ’ Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	10	When he and his servant arrived at Gibeah , a procession of prophets met him ; the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him , and he joined in their prophesying .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	2	When you leave me today , you will meet two men near Rachel ’ s tomb , at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin . They will say to you , “ The donkeys you set out to look for have been found . And now your father has stopped thinking about them and is worried about you . He is asking , ‘ What shall I do about my son ? ’ ”
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	3	‘ Then you will go on from there until you reach the great tree of Tabor . Three men going up to worship God at Bethel will meet you there . One will be carrying three young goats , another three loaves of bread , and another a skin of wine .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	4	They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread , which you will accept from them .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	5	‘ After that you will go to Gibeah of God , where there is a Philistine outpost . As you approach the town , you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place with lyres , tambourines , pipes and harps being played before them , and they will be prophesying .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	6	The Spirit of the Lord will come powerfully upon you , and you will prophesy with them ; and you will be changed into a different person .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	9	As Saul turned to leave Samuel , God changed Saul ’ s heart , and all these signs were fulfilled that day .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	11	When all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets , they asked each other , ‘ What is this that has happened to the son of Kish ? Is Saul also among the prophets ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	12	A man who lived there answered , ‘ And who is their father ? ’ So it became a saying : ‘ Is Saul also among the prophets ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	13	After Saul stopped prophesying , he went to the high place .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	14	Now Saul ’ s uncle asked him and his servant , ‘ Where have you been ? ’ ‘ Looking for the donkeys , ’ he said . ‘ But when we saw they were not to be found , we went to Samuel. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	15	Saul ’ s uncle said , ‘ Tell me what Samuel said to you. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	16	Saul replied , ‘ He assured us that the donkeys had been found. ’ But he did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	17	Samuel summoned the people of Israel to the Lord at Mizpah
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	18	and said to them , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : “ I brought Israel up out of Egypt , and I delivered you from the power of Egypt and all the kingdoms that oppressed you. ”
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	19	But you have now rejected your God , who saves you out of all your disasters and calamities . And you have said , “ No , appoint a king over us. ” So now present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and clans. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	20	When Samuel had made all Israel come forward by tribes , the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	21	Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin , clan by clan , and Matri ’ s clan was taken . Finally Saul son of Kish was taken . But when they looked for him , he was not to be found .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	22	So they enquired further of the Lord , ‘ Has the man come here yet ? ’ And the Lord said , ‘ Yes , he has hidden himself among the supplies. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	23	They ran and brought him out , and as he stood among the people he was a head taller than any of the others .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	24	Samuel said to all the people , ‘ Do you see the man the Lord has chosen ? There is no one like him among all the people. ’ Then the people shouted , ‘ Long live the king ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	25	Samuel explained to the people the rights and duties of kingship . He wrote them down on a scroll and deposited it before the Lord . Then Samuel dismissed the people to go to their own homes .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	10	26	Saul also went to his home in Gibeah , accompanied by valiant men whose hearts God had touched .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	11	11	The next day Saul separated his men into three divisions ; during the last watch of the night they broke into the camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them until the heat of the day .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	11	5	Just then Saul was returning from the fields , behind his oxen , and he asked , ‘ What is wrong with everyone ? Why are they weeping ? ’ Then they repeated to him what the men of Jabesh had said .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	11	7	He took a pair of oxen , cut them into pieces , and sent the pieces by messengers throughout Israel , proclaiming , ‘ This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel. ’ Then the terror of the Lord fell on the people , and they came out together as one .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	6	Jonathan said to his young armour-bearer , ‘ Come , let ’ s go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised men . Perhaps the Lord will act on our behalf . Nothing can hinder the Lord from saving , whether by many or by few. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	7	‘ Do all that you have in mind , ’ his armour-bearer said . ‘ Go ahead ; I am with you heart and soul. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	8	Jonathan said , ‘ Come on , then ; we will cross over towards them and let them see us .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	9	If they say to us , “ Wait there until we come to you , ” we will stay where we are and not go up to them .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	10	But if they say , “ Come up to us , ” we will climb up , because that will be our sign that the Lord has given them into our hands. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	11	So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost . ‘ Look ! ’ said the Philistines . ‘ The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	12	The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armour-bearer , ‘ Come up to us and we ’ ll teach you a lesson. ’ So Jonathan said to his armour-bearer , ‘ Climb up after me ; the Lord has given them into the hand of Israel. ’

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	16	Saul ’ s lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	17	Then Saul said to the men who were with him , ‘ Muster the forces and see who has left us. ’ When they did , it was Jonathan and his armour-bearer who were not there .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	18	Saul said to Ahijah , ‘ Bring the ark of God. ’ ( At that time it was with the Israelites . ) [ c ]
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	19	While Saul was talking to the priest , the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more . So Saul said to the priest , ‘ Withdraw your hand. ’

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	26	When they went into the woods , they saw the honey oozing out ; yet no one put his hand to his mouth , because they feared the oath .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	27	But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath , so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb . He raised his hand to his mouth , and his eyes brightened . [ d ]
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	28	Then one of the soldiers told him , ‘ Your father bound the army under a strict oath , saying , “ Cursed be anyone who eats food today ! ” That is why the men are faint. ’

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	32	They pounced on the plunder and , taking sheep , cattle and calves , they butchered them on the ground and ate them , together with the blood .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	33	Then someone said to Saul , ‘ Look , the men are sinning against the Lord by eating meat that has blood in it. ’ ‘ You have broken faith , ’ he said . ‘ Roll a large stone over here at once. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	34	Then he said , ‘ Go out among the men and tell them , “ Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep , and slaughter them here and eat them . Do not sin against the Lord by eating meat with blood still in it. ” ’ So everyone brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	35	Then Saul built an altar to the Lord ; it was the first time he had done this .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	36	Saul said , ‘ Let us go down and pursue the Philistines by night and plunder them till dawn , and let us not leave one of them alive. ’ ‘ Do whatever seems best to you , ’ they replied . But the priest said , ‘ Let us enquire of God here. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	37	So Saul asked God , ‘ Shall I go down and pursue the Philistines ? Will you give them into Israel ’ s hand ? ’ But God did not answer him that day .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	38	Saul therefore said , ‘ Come here , all you who are leaders of the army , and let us find out what sin has been committed today .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	39	As surely as the Lord who rescues Israel lives , even if the guilt lies with my son Jonathan , he must die. ’ But not one of them said a word .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	40	Saul then said to all the Israelites , ‘ You stand over there ; I and Jonathan my son will stand over here. ’ ‘ Do what seems best to you , ’ they replied .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	41	Then Saul prayed to the Lord , the God of Israel , ‘ Why have you not answered your servant today ? If the fault is in me or my son Jonathan , respond with Urim , but if the men of Israel are at fault , [ e ] respond with Thummim. ’ Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot , and the men were cleared .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	42	Saul said , ‘ Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son. ’ And Jonathan was taken .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	43	Then Saul said to Jonathan , ‘ Tell me what you have done. ’ So Jonathan told him , ‘ I tasted a little honey with the end of my staff . And now I must die ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	44	Saul said , ‘ May God deal with me , be it ever so severely , if you do not die , Jonathan. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	45	But the men said to Saul , ‘ Should Jonathan die – he who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel ? Never ! As surely as the Lord lives , not a hair of his head shall fall to the ground , for he did this today with God ’ s help. ’ So the men rescued Jonathan , and he was not put to death .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	46	Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines , and they withdrew to their own land .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	14	47	After Saul had assumed rule over Israel , he fought against their enemies on every side : Moab , the Ammonites , Edom , the kings [ f ] of Zobah , and the Philistines . Wherever he turned , he inflicted punishment on them . [ g ]

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	15	5	Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	15	6	Then he said to the Kenites , ‘ Go away , leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them ; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt. ’ So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	15	12	Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul , but he was told , ‘ Saul has gone to Carmel . There he has set up a monument in his own honour and has turned and gone on down to Gilgal. ’

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	15	24	Then Saul said to Samuel , ‘ I have sinned . I violated the Lord ’ s command and your instructions . I was afraid of the men and so I gave in to them .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	15	25	Now I beg you , forgive my sin and come back with me , so that I may worship the Lord. ’

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	15	31	So Samuel went back with Saul , and Saul worshipped the Lord .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	22	David left his things with the keeper of supplies , ran to the battle lines and asked his brothers how they were .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	23	As he was talking with them , Goliath , the Philistine champion from Gath , stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance , and David heard it .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	24	Whenever the Israelites saw the man , they all fled from him in great fear .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	25	Now the Israelites had been saying , ‘ Do you see how this man keeps coming out ? He comes out to defy Israel . The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him . He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his family from taxes in Israel. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	26	David asked the men standing near him , ‘ What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel ? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	27	They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him , ‘ This is what will be done for the man who kills him. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	28	When Eliab , David ’ s eldest brother , heard him speaking with the men , he burned with anger at him and asked , ‘ Why have you come down here ? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness ? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is ; you came down only to watch the battle. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	29	‘ Now what have I done ? ’ said David . ‘ Can ’ t I even speak ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	30	He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter , and the men answered him as before .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	31	What David said was overheard and reported to Saul , and Saul sent for him .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	32	David said to Saul , ‘ Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine ; your servant will go and fight him. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	33	Saul replied , ‘ You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him ; you are only a young man , and he has been a warrior from his youth. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	34	But David said to Saul , ‘ Your servant has been keeping his father ’ s sheep . When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock ,
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	35	I went after it , struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth . When it turned on me , I seized it by its hair , struck it and killed it .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	36	Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear ; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them , because he has defied the armies of the living God .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	37	The Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine. ’ Saul said to David , ‘ Go , and the Lord be with you. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	38	Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic . He put a coat of armour on him and a bronze helmet on his head .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	39	David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around , because he was not used to them . ‘ I can not go in these , ’ he said to Saul , ‘ because I am not used to them. ’ So he took them off .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	40	Then he took his staff in his hand , chose five smooth stones from the stream , put them in the pouch of his shepherd ’ s bag and , with his sling in his hand , approached the Philistine .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	41	Meanwhile , the Philistine , with his shield-bearer in front of him , kept coming closer to David .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	42	He looked David over and saw that he was little more than a boy , glowing with health and handsome , and he despised him .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	43	He said to David , ‘ Am I a dog , that you come at me with sticks ? ’ And the Philistine cursed David by his gods .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	44	‘ Come here , ’ he said , ‘ and I ’ ll give your flesh to the birds and the wild animals ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	45	David said to the Philistine , ‘ You come against me with sword and spear and javelin , but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty , the God of the armies of Israel , whom you have defied .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	46	This day the Lord will deliver you into my hands , and I ’ ll strike you down and cut off your head . This very day I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds and the wild animals , and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	47	All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves ; for the battle is the Lord ’ s , and he will give all of you into our hands. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	48	As the Philistine moved closer to attack him , David ran quickly towards the battle line to meet him .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	49	Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone , he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead . The stone sank into his forehead , and he fell face down on the ground .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	50	So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone ; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	51	David ran and stood over him . He took hold of the Philistine ’ s sword and drew it from the sheath . After he killed him , he cut off his head with the sword . When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead , they turned and ran .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	52	Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath [ f ] and to the gates of Ekron . Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	53	When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines , they plundered their camp .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	54	David took the Philistine ’ s head and brought it to Jerusalem ; he put the Philistine ’ s weapons in his own tent .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	55	As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine , he said to Abner , commander of the army , ‘ Abner , whose son is that young man ? ’ Abner replied , ‘ As surely as you live , Your Majesty , I don ’ t know. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	56	The king said , ‘ Find out whose son this young man is. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	17	57	As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine , Abner took him and brought him before Saul , with David still holding the Philistine ’ s head .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	18	But David said to Saul , ‘ Who am I , and what is my family or my clan in Israel , that I should become the king ’ s son-in-law ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	2	From that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return home to his family .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	3	And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	4	Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David , along with his tunic , and even his sword , his bow and his belt .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	5	Whatever mission Saul sent him on , David was so successful that Saul gave him a high rank in the army . This pleased all the troops , and Saul ’ s officers as well .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	6	When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine , the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing , with joyful songs and with tambourines and lyres .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	7	As they danced , they sang : ‘ Saul has slain his thousands , and David his tens of thousands. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	8	Saul was very angry ; this refrain displeased him greatly . ‘ They have credited David with tens of thousands , ’ he thought , ‘ but me with only thousands . What more can he get but the kingdom ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	9	And from that time on Saul kept a close eye on David .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	10	The next day an evil [ a ] spirit from God came forcefully on Saul . He was prophesying in his house , while David was playing the lyre , as he usually did . Saul had a spear in his hand
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	11	and he hurled it , saying to himself , ‘ I ’ ll pin David to the wall. ’ But David eluded him twice .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	12	Saul was afraid of David , because the Lord was with David but had departed from Saul .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	13	So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men , and David led the troops in their campaigns .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	14	In everything he did he had great success , because the Lord was with him .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	15	When Saul saw how successful he was , he was afraid of him .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	16	But all Israel and Judah loved David , because he led them in their campaigns .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	17	Saul said to David , ‘ Here is my elder daughter Merab . I will give her to you in marriage ; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the Lord. ’ For Saul said to himself , ‘ I will not raise a hand against him . Let the Philistines do that ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	19	So [ b ] when the time came for Merab , Saul ’ s daughter , to be given to David , she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	20	Now Saul ’ s daughter Michal was in love with David , and when they told Saul about it , he was pleased .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	21	‘ I will give her to him , ’ he thought , ‘ so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. ’ So Saul said to David , ‘ Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	22	Then Saul ordered his attendants : ‘ Speak to David privately and say , “ Look , the king likes you , and his attendants all love you ; now become his son-in-law. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	23	They repeated these words to David . But David said , ‘ Do you think it is a small matter to become the king ’ s son-in-law ? I ’ m only a poor man and little known. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	24	When Saul ’ s servants told him what David had said ,
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	25	Saul replied , ‘ Say to David , “ The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins , to take revenge on his enemies. ” ’ Saul ’ s plan was for David to fall by the hands of the Philistines .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	26	When the attendants told David these things , he was pleased to become the king ’ s son-in-law . So before the allotted time elapsed ,
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	27	David took his men with him and went out and killed two hundred Philistines and brought back their foreskins . They counted out the full number to the king so that David might become the king ’ s son-in-law . Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	28	When Saul realised that the Lord was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David ,
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	29	Saul became still more afraid of him , and he remained his enemy for the rest of his days .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	18	30	The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle , and as often as they did , David met with more success than the rest of Saul ’ s officers , and his name became well known . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	1	Samuel 19:9 Or But a harmful Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	19	Word came to Saul : ‘ David is in Naioth at Ramah ’ ;
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	2	and warned him , ‘ My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you . Be on your guard tomorrow morning ; go into hiding and stay there .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	3	I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are . I ’ ll speak to him about you and will tell you what I find out. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	4	Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him , ‘ Let not the king do wrong to his servant David ; he has not wronged you , and what he has done has benefited you greatly .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	5	He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine . The Lord won a great victory for all Israel , and you saw it and were glad . Why then would you do wrong to an innocent man like David by killing him for no reason ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	6	Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath : ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , David will not be put to death. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	7	So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation . He brought him to Saul , and David was with Saul as before .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	8	Once more war broke out , and David went out and fought the Philistines . He struck them with such force that they fled before him .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	9	But an evil [ a ] spirit from the Lord came on Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand . While David was playing the lyre ,
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	10	Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear , but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the wall . That night David made good his escape .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	11	Saul sent men to David ’ s house to watch it and to kill him in the morning . But Michal , David ’ s wife , warned him , ‘ If you don ’ t run for your life tonight , tomorrow you ’ ll be killed. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	12	So Michal let David down through a window , and he fled and escaped .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	13	Then Michal took an idol and laid it on the bed , covering it with a garment and putting some goats ’ hair at the head .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	14	When Saul sent the men to capture David , Michal said , ‘ He is ill. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	15	Then Saul sent the men back to see David and told them , ‘ Bring him up to me in his bed so that I may kill him. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	16	But when the men entered , there was the idol in the bed , and at the head was some goats ’ hair .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	17	Saul said to Michal , ‘ Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped ? ’ Michal told him , ‘ He said to me , “ Let me get away . Why should I kill you ? ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	18	When David had fled and made his escape , he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him . Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	20	so he sent men to capture him . But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying , with Samuel standing there as their leader , the Spirit of God came on Saul ’ s men , and they also prophesied .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	21	Saul was told about it , and he sent more men , and they prophesied too . Saul sent men a third time , and they also prophesied .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	22	Finally , he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Seku . And he asked , ‘ Where are Samuel and David ? ’ ‘ Over in Naioth at Ramah , ’ they said .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	23	So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah . But the Spirit of God came even on him , and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	19	24	He stripped off his garments , and he too prophesied in Samuel ’ s presence . He lay naked all that day and all that night . This is why people say , ‘ Is Saul also among the prophets ? ’ Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	20	I will shoot three arrows to the side of it , as though I were shooting at a target .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	2	‘ Never ! ’ Jonathan replied . ‘ You are not going to die ! Look , my father doesn ’ t do anything , great or small , without letting me know . Why should he hide this from me ? It isn ’ t so ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	3	But David took an oath and said , ‘ Your father knows very well that I have found favour in your eyes , and he has said to himself , “ Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved. ” Yet as surely as the Lord lives and as you live , there is only a step between me and death. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	4	Jonathan said to David , ‘ Whatever you want me to do , I ’ ll do for you. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	5	So David said , ‘ Look , tomorrow is the New Moon feast , and I am supposed to dine with the king ; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	6	If your father misses me at all , tell him , “ David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem , his home town , because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan. ”
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	7	If he says , “ Very well , ” then your servant is safe . But if he loses his temper , you can be sure that he is determined to harm me .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	8	As for you , show kindness to your servant , for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the Lord . If I am guilty , then kill me yourself ! Why hand me over to your father ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	9	‘ Never ! ’ Jonathan said . ‘ If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you , wouldn ’ t I tell you ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	10	David asked , ‘ Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	11	‘ Come , ’ Jonathan said , ‘ let ’ s go out into the field. ’ So they went there together .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	12	Then Jonathan said to David , ‘ I swear by the Lord , the God of Israel , that I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow ! If he is favourably disposed towards you , will I not send you word and let you know ?
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	13	But if my father intends to harm you , may the Lord deal with me , be it ever so severely , if I do not let you know and send you away in peace . May the Lord be with you as he has been with my father .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	14	But show me unfailing kindness like the Lord ’ s kindness as long as I live , so that I may not be killed ,
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	15	and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family – not even when the Lord has cut off every one of David ’ s enemies from the face of the earth. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	16	So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David , saying , ‘ May the Lord call David ’ s enemies to account. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	17	And Jonathan made David reaffirm his oath out of love for him , because he loved him as he loved himself .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	18	Then Jonathan said to David , ‘ Tomorrow is the New Moon feast . You will be missed , because your seat will be empty .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	19	The day after tomorrow , towards evening , go to the place where you hid when this trouble began , and wait by the stone Ezel .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	21	Then I will send a boy and say , “ Go , find the arrows. ” If I say to him , “ Look , the arrows are on this side of you ; bring them here , ” then come , because , as surely as the Lord lives , you are safe ; there is no danger .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	22	But if I say to the boy , “ Look , the arrows are beyond you , ” then you must go , because the Lord has sent you away .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	23	And about the matter you and I discussed – remember , the Lord is witness between you and me for ever. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	24	So David hid in the field , and when the New Moon feast came , the king sat down to eat .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	25	He sat in his customary place by the wall , opposite Jonathan , [ a ] and Abner sat next to Saul , but David ’ s place was empty .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	26	Saul said nothing that day , for he thought , ‘ Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean – surely he is unclean. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	27	But the next day , the second day of the month , David ’ s place was empty again . Then Saul said to his son Jonathan , ‘ Why hasn ’ t the son of Jesse come to the meal , either yesterday or today ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	28	Jonathan answered , ‘ David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	29	He said , “ Let me go , because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there . If I have found favour in your eyes , let me go to see my brothers. ” That is why he has not come to the king ’ s table. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	30	Saul ’ s anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him , ‘ You son of a perverse and rebellious woman ! Don ’ t I know that you have sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you ?
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	31	As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth , neither you nor your kingdom will be established . Now send someone to bring him to me , for he must die ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	32	‘ Why should he be put to death ? What has he done ? ’ Jonathan asked his father .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	33	But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him . Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	34	Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger ; on that second day of the feast he did not eat , because he was grieved at his father ’ s shameful treatment of David .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	35	In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David . He had a small boy with him ,
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	36	and he said to the boy , ‘ Run and find the arrows I shoot. ’ As the boy ran , he shot an arrow beyond him .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	37	When the boy came to the place where Jonathan ’ s arrow had fallen , Jonathan called out after him , ‘ Isn ’ t the arrow beyond you ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	38	Then he shouted , ‘ Hurry ! Go quickly ! Don ’ t stop ! ’ The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	39	( The boy knew nothing about all this ; only Jonathan and David knew . )
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	40	Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said , ‘ Go , carry them back to town. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	41	After the boy had gone , David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times , with his face to the ground . Then they kissed each other and wept together – but David wept the most .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	20	42	Jonathan said to David , ‘ Go in peace , for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the Lord , saying , “ The Lord is witness between you and me , and between your descendants and my descendants for ever. ” ’ Then David left , and Jonathan went back to the town .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	21	21	[ a ] David went to Nob , to Ahimelek the priest . Ahimelek trembled when he met him , and asked , ‘ Why are you alone ? Why is no one with you ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	21	2	David answered Ahimelek the priest , ‘ The king sent me on a mission and said to me , “ No one is to know anything about the mission I am sending you on. ” As for my men , I have told them to meet me at a certain place .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	21	3	Now then , what have you to hand ? Give me five loaves of bread , or whatever you can find. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	21	4	But the priest answered David , ‘ I don ’ t have any ordinary bread to hand ; however , there is some consecrated bread here – provided the men have kept themselves from women. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	21	5	David replied , ‘ Indeed women have been kept from us , as usual whenever [ b ] I set out . The men ’ s bodies are holy even on missions that are not holy . How much more so today ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	21	6	So the priest gave him the consecrated bread , since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the Lord and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	21	7	Now one of Saul ’ s servants was there that day , detained before the Lord ; he was Doeg the Edomite , Saul ’ s chief shepherd .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	21	8	David asked Ahimelek , ‘ Don ’ t you have a spear or sword here ? I haven ’ t brought my sword or any other weapon , because the king ’ s mission was urgent. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	21	9	The priest replied , ‘ The sword of Goliath the Philistine , whom you killed in the Valley of Elah , is here ; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod . If you want it , take it ; there is no sword here but that one. ’ David said , ‘ There is none like it ; give it to me. ’ David at Gath
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	21	10	That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	21	11	But the servants of Achish said to him , ‘ Isn ’ t this David , the king of the land ? Isn ’ t he the one they sing about in their dances : ‘ “ Saul has slain his thousands , and David his tens of thousands ” ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	21	12	David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	21	13	So he feigned insanity in their presence ; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman , making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	21	14	Achish said to his servants , ‘ Look at the man ! He is insane ! Why bring him to me ?

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	3	From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab , ‘ Would you let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God will do for me ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	4	So he left them with the king of Moab , and they stayed with him as long as David was in the stronghold .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	5	But the prophet Gad said to David , ‘ Do not stay in the stronghold . Go into the land of Judah. ’ So David left and went to the forest of Hereth . Saul kills the priests of Nob
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	6	Now Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered . And Saul was seated , spear in hand , under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah , with all his officials standing at his side .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	7	He said to them , ‘ Listen , men of Benjamin ! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards ? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds ?
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	8	Is that why you have all conspired against me ? No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse . None of you is concerned about me or tells me that my son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me , as he does today. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	9	But Doeg the Edomite , who was standing with Saul ’ s officials , said , ‘ I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelek son of Ahitub at Nob .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	10	Ahimelek enquired of the Lord for him ; he also gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	11	Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelek son of Ahitub and all the men of his family , who were the priests at Nob , and they all came to the king .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	12	Saul said , ‘ Listen now , son of Ahitub. ’ ‘ Yes , my lord , ’ he answered .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	13	Saul said to him , ‘ Why have you conspired against me , you and the son of Jesse , giving him bread and a sword and enquiring of God for him , so that he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me , as he does today ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	14	Ahimelek answered the king , ‘ Who of all your servants is as loyal as David , the king ’ s son-in-law , captain of your bodyguard and highly respected in your household ?
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	15	Was that day the first time I enquired of God for him ? Of course not ! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of his father ’ s family , for your servant knows nothing at all about this whole affair. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	16	But the king said , ‘ You shall surely die , Ahimelek , you and your whole family. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	17	Then the king ordered the guards at his side : ‘ Turn and kill the priests of the Lord , because they too have sided with David . They knew he was fleeing , yet they did not tell me. ’ But the king ’ s officials were unwilling to raise a hand to strike the priests of the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	18	The king then ordered Doeg , ‘ You turn and strike down the priests. ’ So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck them down . That day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	19	He also put to the sword Nob , the town of the priests , with its men and women , its children and infants , and its cattle , donkeys and sheep .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	20	But one son of Ahimelek son of Ahitub , named Abiathar , escaped and fled to join David .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	22	21	He told David that Saul had killed the priests of the Lord .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	23	Find out about all the hiding-places he uses and come back to me with definite information . Then I will go with you ; if he is in the area , I will track him down among all the clans of Judah. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	2	he enquired of the Lord , saying , ‘ Shall I go and attack these Philistines ? ’ The Lord answered him , ‘ Go , attack the Philistines and save Keilah. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	3	But David ’ s men said to him , ‘ Here in Judah we are afraid . How much more , then , if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	4	Once again David enquired of the Lord , and the Lord answered him , ‘ Go down to Keilah , for I am going to give the Philistines into your hand. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	5	So David and his men went to Keilah , fought the Philistines and carried off their livestock . He inflicted heavy losses on the Philistines and saved the people of Keilah .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	6	( Now Abiathar son of Ahimelek had brought the ephod down with him when he fled to David at Keilah . ) Saul pursues David
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	7	Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah , and he said , ‘ God has delivered him into my hands , for David has imprisoned himself by entering a town with gates and bars. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	8	And Saul called up all his forces for battle , to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	9	When David learned that Saul was plotting against him , he said to Abiathar the priest , ‘ Bring the ephod. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	10	David said , ‘ Lord , God of Israel , your servant has heard definitely that Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town on account of me .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	11	Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me to him ? Will Saul come down , as your servant has heard ? Lord , God of Israel , tell your servant. ’ And the Lord said , ‘ He will. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	12	Again David asked , ‘ Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men to Saul ? ’ And the Lord said , ‘ They will. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	13	So David and his men , about six hundred in number , left Keilah and kept moving from place to place . When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah , he did not go there .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	14	David stayed in the wilderness strongholds and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph . Day after day Saul searched for him , but God did not give David into his hands .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	15	While David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph , he learned that [ a ] Saul had come out to take his life .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	16	And Saul ’ s son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and helped him to find strength in God .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	17	‘ Don ’ t be afraid , ’ he said . ‘ My father Saul will not lay a hand on you . You shall be king over Israel , and I will be second to you . Even my father Saul knows this. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	18	The two of them made a covenant before the Lord . Then Jonathan went home , but David remained at Horesh .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	19	The Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said , ‘ Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh , on the hill of Hakilah , south of Jeshimon ?
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	20	Now , Your Majesty , come down whenever it pleases you to do so , and we will be responsible for giving him into your hands. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	21	Saul replied , ‘ The Lord bless you for your concern for me .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	22	Go and get more information . Find out where David usually goes and who has seen him there . They tell me he is very crafty .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	24	So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul . Now David and his men were in the Desert of Maon , in the Arabah south of Jeshimon .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	25	Saul and his men began the search , and when David was told about it , he went down to the rock and stayed in the Desert of Maon . When Saul heard this , he went into the Desert of Maon in pursuit of David .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	26	Saul was going along one side of the mountain , and David and his men were on the other side , hurrying to get away from Saul . As Saul and his forces were closing in on David and his men to capture them ,
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	27	a messenger came to Saul , saying , ‘ Come quickly ! The Philistines are raiding the land. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	23	28	Then Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines . That is why they call this place Sela Hammahlekoth . [ b ]

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	1	Samuel 24:4 Or ‘ Today the Lord is saying Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	24	[ a ] After Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines , he was told , ‘ David is in the Desert of En Gedi. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	2	So Saul took three thousand able young men from all Israel and set out to look for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	3	He came to the sheepfolds along the way ; a cave was there , and Saul went in to relieve himself . David and his men were far back in the cave .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	4	The men said , ‘ This is the day the Lord spoke of when he said [ b ] to you , “ I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish. ” ’ Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul ’ s robe .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	5	Afterwards , David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	6	He said to his men , ‘ The Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master , the Lord ’ s anointed , or lay my hand on him ; for he is the anointed of the Lord. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	7	With these words David sharply rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul . And Saul left the cave and went his way .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	8	Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul , ‘ My lord the king ! ’ When Saul looked behind him , David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	9	He said to Saul , ‘ Why do you listen when men say , “ David is bent on harming you ” ?
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	10	This day you have seen with your own eyes how the Lord gave you into my hands in the cave . Some urged me to kill you , but I spared you ; I said , “ I will not lay my hand on my lord , because he is the Lord ’ s anointed. ”
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	11	See , my father , look at this piece of your robe in my hand ! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you . See that there is nothing in my hand to indicate that I am guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion . I have not wronged you , but you are hunting me down to take my life .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	12	May the Lord judge between you and me . And may the Lord avenge the wrongs you have done to me , but my hand will not touch you .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	13	As the old saying goes , “ From evildoers come evil deeds , ” so my hand will not touch you .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	14	‘ Against whom has the king of Israel come out ? Who are you pursuing ? A dead dog ? A flea ?
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	15	May the Lord be our judge and decide between us . May he consider my cause and uphold it ; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	16	When David finished saying this , Saul asked , ‘ Is that your voice , David my son ? ’ And he wept aloud .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	17	‘ You are more righteous than I , ’ he said . ‘ You have treated me well , but I have treated you badly .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	18	You have just now told me about the good you did to me ; the Lord gave me into your hands , but you did not kill me .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	19	When a man finds his enemy , does he let him get away unharmed ? May the Lord reward you well for the way you treated me today .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	20	I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	21	Now swear to me by the Lord that you will not kill off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father ’ s family. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	24	22	So David gave his oath to Saul . Then Saul returned home , but David and his men went up to the stronghold . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	25	Please pay no attention , my lord , to that wicked man Nabal . He is just like his name – his name means Fool , and folly goes with him . And as for me , your servant , I did not see the men my lord sent .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	2	A certain man in Maon , who had property there at Carmel , was very wealthy . He had a thousand goats and three thousand sheep , which he was shearing in Carmel .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	3	His name was Nabal and his wife ’ s name was Abigail . She was an intelligent and beautiful woman , but her husband was surly and mean in his dealings – he was a Calebite .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	4	While David was in the wilderness , he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	5	So he sent ten young men and said to them , ‘ Go up to Nabal at Carmel and greet him in my name .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	6	Say to him : “ Long life to you ! Good health to you and your household ! And good health to all that is yours !
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	7	‘ “ Now I hear that it is sheep-shearing time . When your shepherds were with us , we did not ill-treat them , and the whole time they were at Carmel nothing of theirs was missing .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	8	Ask your own servants and they will tell you . Therefore be favourable towards my men , since we come at a festive time . Please give your servants and your son David whatever you can find for them. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	9	When David ’ s men arrived , they gave Nabal this message in David ’ s name . Then they waited .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	10	Nabal answered David ’ s servants , ‘ Who is this David ? Who is this son of Jesse ? Many servants are breaking away from their masters these days .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	11	Why should I take my bread and water , and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers , and give it to men coming from who knows where ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	12	David ’ s men turned round and went back . When they arrived , they reported every word .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	13	David said to his men , ‘ Each of you strap on your sword ! ’ So they did , and David strapped his on as well . About four hundred men went up with David , while two hundred stayed with the supplies .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	14	One of the servants told Abigail , Nabal ’ s wife , ‘ David sent messengers from the wilderness to give our master his greetings , but he hurled insults at them .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	15	Yet these men were very good to us . They did not ill-treat us , and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	16	Night and day they were a wall around us the whole time we were herding our sheep near them .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	17	Now think it over and see what you can do , because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household . He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	18	Abigail acted quickly . She took two hundred loaves of bread , two skins of wine , five dressed sheep , five seahs [ b ] of roasted grain , a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs , and loaded them on donkeys .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	19	Then she told her servants , ‘ Go on ahead ; I ’ ll follow you. ’ But she did not tell her husband Nabal .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	20	As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine , there were David and his men descending towards her , and she met them .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	21	David had just said , ‘ It ’ s been useless – all my watching over this fellow ’ s property in the wilderness so that nothing of his was missing . He has paid me back evil for good .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	22	May God deal with David , [ c ] be it ever so severely , if by morning I leave alive one male of all who belong to him ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	23	When Abigail saw David , she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	24	She fell at his feet and said : ‘ Pardon your servant , my lord , and let me speak to you ; hear what your servant has to say .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	26	And now , my lord , as surely as the Lord your God lives and as you live , since the Lord has kept you from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands , may your enemies and all who are intent on harming my lord be like Nabal .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	27	kilograms -
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	28	‘ Please forgive your servant ’ s presumption . The Lord your God will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my lord , because you fight the Lord ’ s battles , and no wrongdoing will be found in you as long as you live .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	29	Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life , the life of my lord will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the Lord your God , but the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	30	When the Lord has fulfilled for my lord every good thing he promised concerning him and has appointed him ruler over Israel ,
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	31	my lord will not have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having avenged himself . And when the Lord your God has brought my lord success , remember your servant. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	32	David said to Abigail , ‘ Praise be to the Lord , the God of Israel , who has sent you today to meet me .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	33	May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	34	Otherwise , as surely as the Lord , the God of Israel , lives , who has kept me from harming you , if you had not come quickly to meet me , not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by daybreak. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	35	Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought to him and said , ‘ Go home in peace . I have heard your words and granted your request. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	36	When Abigail went to Nabal , he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king . He was in high spirits and very drunk . So she told him nothing at all until daybreak .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	37	Then in the morning , when Nabal was sober , his wife told him all these things , and his heart failed him and he became like a stone .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	38	About ten days later , the Lord struck Nabal and he died .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	39	When David heard that Nabal was dead , he said , ‘ Praise be to the Lord , who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with contempt . He has kept his servant from doing wrong and has brought Nabal ’ s wrongdoing down on his own head. ’ Then David sent word to Abigail , asking her to become his wife .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	40	His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail , ‘ David has sent us to you to take you to become his wife. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	41	She bowed down with her face to the ground and said , ‘ I am your servant and am ready to serve you and wash the feet of my lord ’ s servants. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	42	Abigail quickly got on a donkey and , attended by her five female servants , went with David ’ s messengers and became his wife .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	43	David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel , and they both were his wives .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	25	44	But Saul had given his daughter Michal , David ’ s wife , to Paltiel [ d ] son of Laish , who was from Gallim . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	1	Samuel
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	26	The Ziphites went to Saul at Gibeah and said , ‘ Is not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah , which faces Jeshimon ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	2	So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph , with his three thousand select Israelite troops , to search there for David .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	3	Saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of Hakilah facing Jeshimon , but David stayed in the wilderness . When he saw that Saul had followed him there ,
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	4	he sent out scouts and learned that Saul had definitely arrived .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	5	Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped . He saw where Saul and Abner son of Ner , the commander of the army , had lain down . Saul was lying inside the camp , with the army camped around him .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	6	David then asked Ahimelek the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah , Joab ’ s brother , ‘ Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul ? ’ ‘ I ’ ll go with you , ’ said Abishai .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	7	So David and Abishai went to the army by night , and there was Saul , lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head . Abner and the soldiers were lying round him .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	8	Abishai said to David , ‘ Today God has given your enemy into your hands . Now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of the spear ; I won ’ t strike him twice. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	9	But David said to Abishai , ‘ Don ’ t destroy him ! Who can lay a hand on the Lord ’ s anointed and be guiltless ?
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	10	As surely as the Lord lives , ’ he said , ‘ the Lord himself will strike him , or his time will come and he will die , or he will go into battle and perish .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	11	But the Lord forbid that I should lay a hand on the Lord ’ s anointed . Now get the spear and water jug that are near his head , and let ’ s go. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	12	So David took the spear and water jug near Saul ’ s head , and they left . No one saw or knew about it , nor did anyone wake up . They were all sleeping , because the Lord had put them into a deep sleep .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	13	Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away ; there was a wide space between them .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	14	He called out to the army and to Abner son of Ner , ‘ Aren ’ t you going to answer me , Abner ? ’ Abner replied , ‘ Who are you who calls to the king ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	15	David said , ‘ You ’ re a man , aren ’ t you ? And who is like you in Israel ? Why didn ’ t you guard your lord the king ? Someone came to destroy your lord the king .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	16	What you have done is not good . As surely as the Lord lives , you and your men must die , because you did not guard your master , the Lord ’ s anointed . Look around you . Where are the king ’ s spear and water jug that were near his head ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	17	Saul recognised David ’ s voice and said , ‘ Is that your voice , David my son ? ’ David replied , ‘ Yes it is , my lord the king. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	18	And he added , ‘ Why is my lord pursuing his servant ? What have I done , and what wrong am I guilty of ?
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	19	Now let my lord the king listen to his servant ’ s words . If the Lord has incited you against me , then may he accept an offering . If , however , people have done it , may they be cursed before the Lord ! They have driven me today from my share in the Lord ’ s inheritance and have said , “ Go , serve other gods. ”
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	20	Now do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the Lord . The king of Israel has come out to look for a flea – as one hunts a partridge in the mountains. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	21	Then Saul said , ‘ I have sinned . Come back , David my son . Because you considered my life precious today , I will not try to harm you again . Surely I have acted like a fool and have been terribly wrong. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	22	‘ Here is the king ’ s spear , ’ David answered . ‘ Let one of your young men come over and get it .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	23	The Lord rewards everyone for their righteousness and faithfulness . The Lord gave you into my hands today , but I would not lay a hand on the Lord ’ s anointed .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	24	As surely as I valued your life today , so may the Lord value my life and deliver me from all trouble. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	26	25	Then Saul said to David , ‘ May you be blessed , David my son ; you will do great things and surely triumph. ’ So David went on his way , and Saul returned home . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	27	27	But David thought to himself , ‘ One of these days I shall be destroyed by the hand of Saul . The best thing I can do is to escape to the land of the Philistines . Then Saul will give up searching for me anywhere in Israel , and I will slip out of his hand. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	27	2	So David and the six hundred men with him left and went over to Achish son of Maok king of Gath .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	27	3	David and his men settled in Gath with Achish . Each man had his family with him , and David had his two wives : Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel , the widow of Nabal .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	27	4	When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath , he no longer searched for him .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	27	5	Then David said to Achish , ‘ If I have found favour in your eyes , let a place be assigned to me in one of the country towns , that I may live there . Why should your servant live in the royal city with you ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	27	6	So on that day Achish gave him Ziklag , and it has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	27	7	David lived in Philistine territory for a year and four months .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	27	8	Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites , the Girzites and the Amalekites . ( From ancient times these peoples had lived in the land extending to Shur and Egypt . )
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	27	9	Whenever David attacked an area , he did not leave a man or woman alive , but took sheep and cattle , donkeys and camels , and clothes . Then he returned to Achish .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	27	10	When Achish asked , ‘ Where did you go raiding today ? ’ David would say , ‘ Against the Negev of Judah ’ or ‘ Against the Negev of Jerahmeel ’ or ‘ Against the Negev of the Kenites. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	27	11	He did not leave a man or woman alive to be brought to Gath , for he thought , ‘ They might inform on us and say , “ This is what David did. ” ’ And such was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	28	In those days the Philistines gathered their forces to fight against Israel . Achish said to David , ‘ You must understand that you and your men will accompany me in the army. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	2	David said , ‘ Then you will see for yourself what your servant can do. ’ Achish replied , ‘ Very well , I will make you my bodyguard for life. ’ Saul and the medium at Endor
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	3	Now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah . Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	4	The Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem , while Saul gathered all Israel and set up camp at Gilboa .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	5	When Saul saw the Philistine army , he was afraid ; terror filled his heart .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	6	He enquired of the Lord , but the Lord did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	7	Saul then said to his attendants , ‘ Find me a woman who is a medium , so that I may go and enquire of her. ’ ‘ There is one in Endor , ’ they said .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	8	So Saul disguised himself , putting on other clothes , and at night he and two men went to the woman . ‘ Consult a spirit for me , ’ he said , ‘ and bring up for me the one I name. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	9	But the woman said to him , ‘ Surely you know what Saul has done . He has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land . Why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	10	Saul swore to her by the Lord , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , you will not be punished for this. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	11	Then the woman asked , ‘ Whom shall I bring up for you ? ’ ‘ Bring up Samuel , ’ he said .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	12	When the woman saw Samuel , she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul , ‘ Why have you deceived me ? You are Saul ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	13	The king said to her , ‘ Don ’ t be afraid . What do you see ? ’ The woman said , ‘ I see a ghostly figure [ a ] coming up out of the earth. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	14	‘ What does he look like ? ’ he asked . ‘ An old man wearing a robe is coming up , ’ she said . Then Saul knew it was Samuel , and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	15	Samuel said to Saul , ‘ Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up ? ’ ‘ I am in great distress , ’ Saul said . ‘ The Philistines are fighting against me , and God has departed from me . He no longer answers me , either by prophets or by dreams . So I have called on you to tell me what to do. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	16	Samuel said , ‘ Why do you consult me , now that the Lord has departed from you and become your enemy ?
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	17	The Lord has done what he predicted through me . The Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbours – to David .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	18	Because you did not obey the Lord or carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites , the Lord has done this to you today .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	19	The Lord will deliver both Israel and you into the hands of the Philistines , and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me . The Lord will also give the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	20	Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground , filled with fear because of Samuel ’ s words . His strength was gone , for he had eaten nothing all that day and all that night .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	21	When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly shaken , she said , ‘ Look , your servant has obeyed you . I took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	22	Now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so that you may eat and have the strength to go on your way. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	23	He refused and said , ‘ I will not eat. ’ But his men joined the woman in urging him , and he listened to them . He got up from the ground and sat on the couch .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	24	The woman had a fattened calf at the house , which she slaughtered at once . She took some flour , kneaded it and baked bread without yeast .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	28	25	Then she set it before Saul and his men , and they ate . That same night they got up and left . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	29	29	The Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek , and Israel camped by the spring in Jezreel .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	29	2	As the Philistine rulers marched with their units of hundreds and thousands , David and his men were marching at the rear with Achish .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	29	3	The commanders of the Philistines asked , ‘ What about these Hebrews ? ’ Achish replied , ‘ Is this not David , who was an officer of Saul king of Israel ? He has already been with me for over a year , and from the day he left Saul until now , I have found no fault in him. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	29	4	But the Philistine commanders were angry with Achish and said , ‘ Send the man back , that he may return to the place you assigned him . He must not go with us into battle , or he will turn against us during the fighting . How better could he regain his master ’ s favour than by taking the heads of our own men ?
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	29	5	Isn ’ t this the David they sang about in their dances : ‘ “ Saul has slain his thousands , and David his tens of thousands ” ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	29	6	So Achish called David and said to him , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , you have been reliable , and I would be pleased for you to serve with me in the army . From the day you came to me until today , I have found no fault in you , but the rulers don ’ t approve of you .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	29	7	Now turn back and go in peace ; do nothing to displease the Philistine rulers. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	29	8	‘ But what have I done ? ’ asked David . ‘ What have you found against your servant from the day I came to you until now ? Why can ’ t I go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	29	9	Achish answered , ‘ I know that you have been as pleasing in my eyes as an angel of God ; nevertheless , the Philistine commanders have said , “ He must not go up with us into battle. ”
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	29	10	Now get up early , along with your master ’ s servants who have come with you , and leave in the morning as soon as it is light. ’

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	3	When David and his men reached Ziklag , they found it destroyed by fire and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	4	So David and his men wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	5	David ’ s two wives had been captured – Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail , the widow of Nabal of Carmel .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	6	David was greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him ; each one was bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters . But David found strength in the Lord his God .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	7	Then David said to Abiathar the priest , the son of Ahimelek , ‘ Bring me the ephod. ’ Abiathar brought it to him ,
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	8	and David enquired of the Lord , ‘ Shall I pursue this raiding party ? Will I overtake them ? ’ ‘ Pursue them , ’ he answered . ‘ You will certainly overtake them and succeed in the rescue. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	9	David and the six hundred men with him came to the Besor Valley , where some stayed behind .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	10	Two hundred of them were too exhausted to cross the valley , but David and the other four hundred continued the pursuit .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	11	They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David . They gave him water to drink and food to eat –
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	12	part of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins . He ate and was revived , for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	13	David asked him , ‘ Who do you belong to ? Where do you come from ? ’ He said , ‘ I am an Egyptian , the slave of an Amalekite . My master abandoned me when I became ill three days ago .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	14	We raided the Negev of the Kerethites , some territory belonging to Judah and the Negev of Caleb . And we burned Ziklag. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	15	David asked him , ‘ Can you lead me down to this raiding party ? ’ He answered , ‘ Swear to me before God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master , and I will take you down to them. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	16	He led David down , and there they were , scattered over the countryside , eating , drinking and revelling because of the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from Judah .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	17	David fought them from dusk until the evening of the next day , and none of them got away , except four hundred young men who rode off on camels and fled .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	18	David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken , including his two wives .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	19	Nothing was missing : young or old , boy or girl , plunder or anything else they had taken . David brought everything back .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	20	He took all the flocks and herds , and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock , saying , ‘ This is David ’ s plunder. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	21	Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him and who were left behind at the Besor Valley . They came out to meet David and the men with him . As David and his men approached , he asked them how they were .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	22	But all the evil men and troublemakers among David ’ s followers said , ‘ Because they did not go out with us , we will not share with them the plunder we recovered . However , each man may take his wife and children and go. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	23	David replied , ‘ No , my brothers , you must not do that with what the Lord has given us . He has protected us and delivered into our hands the raiding party that came against us .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	24	Who will listen to what you say ? The share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle . All shall share alike. ’
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	30	25	David made this a statute and ordinance for Israel from that day to this .

NIVUK	1%20Samuel	31	1	Samuel
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	31	31	Now the Philistines fought against Israel ; the Israelites fled before them , and many fell dead on Mount Gilboa .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	31	2	The Philistines were in hot pursuit of Saul and his sons , and they killed his sons Jonathan , Abinadab and Malki-Shua .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	31	3	The fighting grew fierce around Saul , and when the archers overtook him , they wounded him critically .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	31	4	Saul said to his armour-bearer , ‘ Draw your sword and run me through , or these uncircumcised fellows will come and run me through and abuse me. ’ But the armour-bearer was terrified and would not do it ; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	31	5	When the armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead , he too fell on his sword and died with him .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	31	6	So Saul and his three sons and his armour-bearer and all his men died together that same day .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	31	7	When the Israelites along the valley and those across the Jordan saw that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died , they abandoned their towns and fled . And the Philistines came and occupied them .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	31	8	The next day , when the Philistines came to strip the dead , they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	31	9	They cut off his head and stripped off his armour , and they sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temple of their idols and among their people .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	31	10	They put his armour in the temple of the Ashtoreths and fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan .
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	31	11	When the people of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul ,
NIVUK	1%20Samuel	31	12	all their valiant men marched through the night to Beth Shan . They took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth Shan and went to Jabesh , where they burned them .

NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	1	After the death of Saul , David returned from striking down the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	3	‘ Where have you come from ? ’ David asked him . He answered , ‘ I have escaped from the Israelite camp. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	4	‘ What happened ? ’ David asked . ‘ Tell me. ’ ‘ The men fled from the battle , ’ he replied . ‘ Many of them fell and died . And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	5	Then David said to the young man who brought him the report , ‘ How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	6	‘ I happened to be on Mount Gilboa , ’ the young man said , ‘ and there was Saul , leaning on his spear , with the chariots and their drivers in hot pursuit .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	7	When he turned round and saw me , he called out to me , and I said , “ What can I do ? ”
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	8	‘ He asked me , “ Who are you ? ” ‘ “ An Amalekite , ” I answered .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	9	‘ Then he said to me , “ Stand here by me and kill me ! I ’ m in the throes of death , but I ’ m still alive. ”
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	10	‘ So I stood beside him and killed him , because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive . And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	11	Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	12	They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan , and for the army of the Lord and for the nation of Israel , because they had fallen by the sword .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	13	David said to the young man who brought him the report , ‘ Where are you from ? ’ ‘ I am the son of a foreigner , an Amalekite , ’ he answered .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	14	David asked him , ‘ Why weren ’ t you afraid to lift your hand to destroy the Lord ’ s anointed ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	15	Then David called one of his men and said , ‘ Go , strike him down ! ’ So he struck him down , and he died .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	16	For David had said to him , ‘ Your blood be on your own head . Your own mouth testified against you when you said , “ I killed the Lord ’ s anointed. ” ’ David ’ s lament for Saul and Jonathan
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	17	David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan ,
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	18	and he ordered that the people of Judah be taught this lament of the bow ( it is written in the Book of Jashar ) :
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	19	‘ A gazelle [ a ] lies slain on your heights , Israel . How the mighty have fallen !
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	20	‘ Tell it not in Gath , proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon , lest the daughters of the Philistines be glad , lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	21	‘ Mountains of Gilboa , may you have neither dew nor rain , may no showers fall on your terraced fields . [ b ] For there the shield of the mighty was despised , the shield of Saul – no longer rubbed with oil .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	22	‘ From the blood of the slain , from the flesh of the mighty , the bow of Jonathan did not turn back , the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	23	Saul and Jonathan – in life they were loved and admired , and in death they were not parted . They were swifter than eagles , they were stronger than lions .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	24	‘ Daughters of Israel , weep for Saul , who clothed you in scarlet and finery , who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	25	‘ How the mighty have fallen in battle ! Jonathan lies slain on your heights .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	1	26	I grieve for you , Jonathan my brother ; you were very dear to me . Your love for me was wonderful , more wonderful than that of women .

NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	3	David also took the men who were with him , each with his family , and they settled in Hebron and its towns .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	4	Then the men of Judah came to Hebron , and there they anointed David king over the tribe of Judah . When David was told that it was the men from Jabesh Gilead who had buried Saul ,
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	5	he sent messengers to them to say to them , ‘ The Lord bless you for showing this kindness to Saul your master by burying him .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	6	May the Lord now show you kindness and faithfulness , and I too will show you the same favour because you have done this .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	7	Now then , be strong and brave , for Saul your master is dead , and the people of Judah have anointed me king over them. ’ War between the houses of David and Saul
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	8	Meanwhile , Abner son of Ner , the commander of Saul ’ s army , had taken Ish-Bosheth son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	9	He made him king over Gilead , Ashuri and Jezreel , and also over Ephraim , Benjamin and all Israel .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	10	Ish-Bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he became king over Israel , and he reigned two years . The tribe of Judah , however , remained loyal to David .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	11	The length of time David was king in Hebron over Judah was seven years and six months .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	12	Abner son of Ner , together with the men of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul , left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	13	Joab son of Zeruiah and David ’ s men went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon . One group sat down on one side of the pool and one group on the other side .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	14	Then Abner said to Joab , ‘ Let ’ s have some of the young men get up and fight hand to hand in front of us. ’ ‘ All right , let them do it , ’ Joab said .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	15	So they stood up and were counted – twelve men for Benjamin and Ish-Bosheth son of Saul , and twelve for David .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	16	Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his dagger into his opponent ’ s side , and they fell down together . So that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim . [ a ]
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	17	The battle that day was very fierce , and Abner and the Israelites were defeated by David ’ s men .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	18	The three sons of Zeruiah were there : Joab , Abishai and Asahel . Now Asahel was as fleet-footed as a wild gazelle .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	19	He chased Abner , turning neither to the right nor to the left as he pursued him .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	20	Abner looked behind him and asked , ‘ Is that you , Asahel ? ’ ‘ It is , ’ he answered .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	21	Then Abner said to him , ‘ Turn aside to the right or to the left ; take on one of the young men and strip him of his weapons. ’ But Asahel would not stop chasing him .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	22	Again Abner warned Asahel , ‘ Stop chasing me ! Why should I strike you down ? How could I look your brother Joab in the face ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	23	But Asahel refused to give up the pursuit ; so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into Asahel ’ s stomach , and the spear came out through his back . He fell there and died on the spot . And every man stopped when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	24	But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner , and as the sun was setting , they came to the hill of Ammah , near Giah on the way to the wasteland of Gibeon .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	25	Then the men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner . They formed themselves into a group and took their stand on top of a hill .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	26	Abner called out to Joab , ‘ Must the sword devour for ever ? Don ’ t you realise that this will end in bitterness ? How long before you order your men to stop pursuing their fellow Israelites ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	27	Joab answered , ‘ As surely as God lives , if you had not spoken , the men would have continued pursuing them until morning. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	28	So Joab blew the trumpet , and all the troops came to a halt ; they no longer pursued Israel , nor did they fight any more .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	29	All that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah . They crossed the Jordan , continued through the morning hours [ b ] and came to Mahanaim .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	30	Then Joab stopped pursuing Abner and assembled the whole army . Besides Asahel , nineteen of David ’ s men were found missing .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	31	But David ’ s men had killed
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	360	Benjaminites who were with Abner .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	2	32	They took Asahel and buried him in his father ’ s tomb at Bethlehem . Then Joab and his men marched all night and arrived at Hebron by daybreak . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	10	and transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish David ’ s throne over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	11	Ish-Bosheth did not dare to say another word to Abner , because he was afraid of him .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	12	Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to say to David , ‘ Whose land is it ? Make an agreement with me , and I will help you bring all Israel over to you. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	13	‘ Good , ’ said David . ‘ I will make an agreement with you . But I demand one thing of you : do not come into my presence unless you bring Michal daughter of Saul when you come to see me. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	14	Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth son of Saul , demanding , ‘ Give me my wife Michal , whom I betrothed to myself for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	15	So Ish-Bosheth gave orders and had her taken away from her husband Paltiel son of Laish .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	16	Her husband , however , went with her , weeping behind her all the way to Bahurim . Then Abner said to him , ‘ Go back home ! ’ So he went back .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	17	Abner conferred with the elders of Israel and said , ‘ For some time you have wanted to make David your king .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	18	Now do it ! For the Lord promised David , “ By my servant David I will rescue my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies. ” ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	19	Abner also spoke to the Benjaminites in person . Then he went to Hebron to tell David everything that Israel and the whole tribe of Benjamin wanted to do .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	20	When Abner , who had twenty men with him , came to David at Hebron , David prepared a feast for him and his men .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	21	Then Abner said to David , ‘ Let me go at once and assemble all Israel for my lord the king , so that they may make a covenant with you , and that you may rule over all that your heart desires. ’ So David sent Abner away , and he went in peace . Joab murders Abner
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	22	Just then David ’ s men and Joab returned from a raid and brought with them a great deal of plunder . But Abner was no longer with David in Hebron , because David had sent him away , and he had gone in peace .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	23	When Joab and all the soldiers with him arrived , he was told that Abner son of Ner had come to the king and that the king had sent him away and that he had gone in peace .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	24	So Joab went to the king and said , ‘ What have you done ? Look , Abner came to you . Why did you let him go ? Now he is gone !
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	25	You know Abner son of Ner ; he came to deceive you and observe your movements and find out everything you are doing. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	26	Joab then left David and sent messengers after Abner , and they brought him back from the cistern at Sirah . But David did not know it .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	27	Now when Abner returned to Hebron , Joab took him aside into an inner chamber , as if to speak with him privately . And there , to avenge the blood of his brother Asahel , Joab stabbed him in the stomach , and he died .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	28	Later , when David heard about this , he said , ‘ I and my kingdom are for ever innocent before the Lord concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	29	May his blood fall on the head of Joab and on his whole family ! May Joab ’ s family never be without someone who has a running sore or leprosy [ a ] or who leans on a crutch or who falls by the sword or who lacks food. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	30	( Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle of Gibeon . )
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	31	Then David said to Joab and all the people with him , ‘ Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and walk in mourning in front of Abner. ’ King David himself walked behind the bier .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	32	They buried Abner in Hebron , and the king wept aloud at Abner ’ s tomb . All the people wept also .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	33	The king sang this lament for Abner : ‘ Should Abner have died as the lawless die ?
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	34	Your hands were not bound , your feet were not fettered . You fell as one falls before the wicked. ’ And all the people wept over him again .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	35	Then they all came and urged David to eat something while it was still day ; but David took an oath , saying , ‘ May God deal with me , be it ever so severely , if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets ! ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	36	All the people took note and were pleased ; indeed , everything the king did pleased them .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	37	So on that day all the people there and all Israel knew that the king had no part in the murder of Abner son of Ner .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	38	Then the king said to his men , ‘ Do you not realise that a commander and a great man has fallen in Israel this day ?
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	3	39	And today , though I am the anointed king , I am weak , and these sons of Zeruiah are too strong for me . May the Lord repay the evildoer according to his evil deeds ! ’ Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Samuel	4	9	David answered Rekab and his brother Baanah , the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , who has delivered me out of every trouble ,
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	4	10	when someone told me , “ Saul is dead , ” and thought he was bringing good news , I seized him and put him to death in Ziklag . That was the reward I gave him for his news !

NIVUK	2%20Samuel	4	12	So David gave an order to his men , and they killed them . They cut off their hands and feet and hung the bodies by the pool in Hebron .

NIVUK	2%20Samuel	10	6	When the Ammonites realised that they had become obnoxious to David , they hired twenty thousand Aramean foot soldiers from Beth Rehob and Zobah , as well as the king of Maakah with a thousand men , and also twelve thousand men from Tob .

NIVUK	2%20Samuel	10	8	The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance of their city gate , while the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maakah were by themselves in the open country .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	10	9	Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him ; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	10	11	Joab said , ‘ If the Arameans are too strong for me , then you are to come to my rescue ; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you , then I will come to rescue you .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	10	12	Be strong , and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God . The Lord will do what is good in his sight. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	10	13	Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans , and they fled before him .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	10	14	When the Ammonites realised that the Arameans were fleeing , they fled before Abishai and went inside the city . So Joab returned from fighting the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem .

NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	11	Uriah said to David , ‘ The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents , [ a ] and my commander Joab and my lord ’ s men are camped in the open country . How could I go to my house to eat and drink and make love to my wife ? As surely as you live , I will not do such a thing ! ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	3	and David sent someone to find out about her . The man said , ‘ She is Bathsheba , the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	4	Then David sent messengers to get her . She came to him , and he slept with her . ( Now she was purifying herself from her monthly uncleanness . ) Then she went back home .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	5	The woman conceived and sent word to David , saying , ‘ I am pregnant. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	6	So David sent this word to Joab : ‘ Send me Uriah the Hittite. ’ And Joab sent him to David .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	7	When Uriah came to him , David asked him how Joab was , how the soldiers were and how the war was going .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	8	Then David said to Uriah , ‘ Go down to your house and wash your feet. ’ So Uriah left the palace , and a gift from the king was sent after him .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	9	But Uriah slept at the entrance to the palace with all his master ’ s servants and did not go down to his house .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	10	David was told , ‘ Uriah did not go home. ’ So he asked Uriah , ‘ Haven ’ t you just come from a military campaign ? Why didn ’ t you go home ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	12	Then David said to him , ‘ Stay here one more day , and tomorrow I will send you back. ’ So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	13	At David ’ s invitation , he ate and drank with him , and David made him drunk . But in the evening Uriah went out to sleep on his mat among his master ’ s servants ; he did not go home .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	14	In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	15	In it he wrote , ‘ Put Uriah out in front where the fighting is fiercest . Then withdraw from him so that he will be struck down and die. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	16	So while Joab had the city under siege , he put Uriah at a place where he knew the strongest defenders were .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	17	When the men of the city came out and fought against Joab , some of the men in David ’ s army fell ; moreover , Uriah the Hittite died .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	18	Joab sent David a full account of the battle .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	19	He instructed the messenger : ‘ When you have finished giving the king this account of the battle ,
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	20	the king ’ s anger may flare up , and he may ask you , “ Why did you get so close to the city to fight ? Didn ’ t you know they would shoot arrows from the wall ?
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	21	Who killed Abimelek son of Jerub-Besheth ? [ b ] Didn ’ t a woman drop an upper millstone on him from the wall , so that he died in Thebez ? Why did you get so close to the wall ? ” If he asks you this , then say to him , “ Moreover , your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead. ” ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	22	The messenger set out , and when he arrived he told David everything Joab had sent him to say .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	23	The messenger said to David , ‘ The men overpowered us and came out against us in the open , but we drove them back to the entrance of the city gate .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	24	Then the archers shot arrows at your servants from the wall , and some of the king ’ s men died . Moreover , your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	25	David told the messenger , ‘ Say this to Joab : “ Don ’ t let this upset you ; the sword devours one as well as another . Press the attack against the city and destroy it. ” Say this to encourage Joab. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	26	When Uriah ’ s wife heard that her husband was dead , she mourned for him .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	11	27	After the time of mourning was over , David had her brought to his house , and she became his wife and bore him a son . But the thing David had done displeased the Lord . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	12	You did it in secret , but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel. ” ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	3	but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb that he had bought . He raised it , and it grew up with him and his children . It shared his food , drank from his cup and even slept in his arms . It was like a daughter to him .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	4	‘ Now a traveller came to the rich man , but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveller who had come to him . Instead , he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	5	David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , the man who did this must die !
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	6	He must pay for that lamb four times over , because he did such a thing and had no pity. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	7	Then Nathan said to David , ‘ You are the man ! This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : “ I anointed you king over Israel , and I delivered you from the hand of Saul .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	8	I gave your master ’ s house to you , and your master ’ s wives into your arms . I gave you all Israel and Judah . And if all this had been too little , I would have given you even more .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	9	Why did you despise the word of the Lord by doing what is evil in his eyes ? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own . You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	10	Now , therefore , the sword shall never depart from your house , because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own. ”
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	11	‘ This is what the Lord says : “ Out of your own household I am going to bring calamity on you . Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to one who is close to you , and he will sleep with your wives in broad daylight .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	13	Then David said to Nathan , ‘ I have sinned against the Lord. ’ Nathan replied , ‘ The Lord has taken away your sin . You are not going to die .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	14	But because by doing this you have shown utter contempt for [ a ] the Lord , the son born to you will die. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	15	After Nathan had gone home , the Lord struck the child that Uriah ’ s wife had borne to David , and he became ill.
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	16	David pleaded with God for the child . He fasted and spent the nights lying in sackcloth [ b ] on the ground .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	17	The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground , but he refused , and he would not eat any food with them .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	18	On the seventh day the child died . David ’ s attendants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead , for they thought , ‘ While the child was still living , he wouldn ’ t listen to us when we spoke to him . How can we now tell him the child is dead ? He may do something desperate. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	19	David noticed that his attendants were whispering among themselves , and he realised that the child was dead . ‘ Is the child dead ? ’ he asked . ‘ Yes , ’ they replied , ‘ he is dead. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	20	Then David got up from the ground . After he had washed , put on lotions and changed his clothes , he went into the house of the Lord and worshipped . Then he went to his own house , and at his request they served him food , and he ate .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	21	His attendants asked him , ‘ Why are you acting in this way ? While the child was alive , you fasted and wept , but now that the child is dead , you get up and eat ! ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	22	He answered , ‘ While the child was still alive , I fasted and wept . I thought , “ Who knows ? The Lord may be gracious to me and let the child live. ”
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	23	But now that he is dead , why should I go on fasting ? Can I bring him back again ? I will go to him , but he will not return to me. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	24	Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba , and he went to her and made love to her . She gave birth to a son , and they named him Solomon . The Lord loved him ;
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	25	and because the Lord loved him , he sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah . [ c ]
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	26	Meanwhile Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal citadel .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	27	Joab then sent messengers to David , saying , ‘ I have fought against Rabbah and taken its water supply .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	28	Now muster the rest of the troops and besiege the city and capture it . Otherwise I shall take the city , and it will be named after me. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	29	So David mustered the entire army and went to Rabbah , and attacked and captured it .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	30	David took the crown from their king ’ s [ d ] head , and it was placed on his own head . It weighed a talent [ e ] of gold , and it was set with precious stones . David took a great quantity of plunder from the city
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	12	31	and brought out the people who were there , consigning them to labour with saws and with iron picks and axes , and he made them work at brickmaking . [ f ] David did this to all the Ammonite towns . Then he and his entire army returned to Jerusalem . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	13	What about me ? Where could I get rid of my disgrace ? And what about you ? You would be like one of the wicked fools in Israel . Please speak to the king ; he will not keep me from being married to you. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	3	Now Amnon had an advisor named Jonadab son of Shimeah , David ’ s brother . Jonadab was a very shrewd man .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	4	He asked Amnon , ‘ Why do you , the king ’ s son , look so haggard morning after morning ? Won ’ t you tell me ? ’ Amnon said to him , ‘ I ’ m in love with Tamar , my brother Absalom ’ s sister. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	5	‘ Go to bed and pretend to be ill , ’ Jonadab said . ‘ When your father comes to see you , say to him , “ I would like my sister Tamar to come and give me something to eat . Let her prepare the food in my sight so that I may watch her and then eat it from her hand. ” ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	6	So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill . When the king came to see him , Amnon said to him , ‘ I would like my sister Tamar to come and make some special bread in my sight , so that I may eat from her hand. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	7	David sent word to Tamar at the palace : ‘ Go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	8	So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon , who was lying down . She took some dough , kneaded it , made the bread in his sight and baked it .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	9	Then she took the pan and served him the bread , but he refused to eat . ‘ Send everyone out of here , ’ Amnon said . So everyone left him .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	10	Then Amnon said to Tamar , ‘ Bring the food here into my bedroom so that I may eat from your hand. ’ And Tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon in his bedroom .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	11	But when she took it to him to eat , he grabbed her and said , ‘ Come to bed with me , my sister. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	12	‘ No , my brother ! ’ she said to him . ‘ Don ’ t force me ! Such a thing should not be done in Israel ! Don ’ t do this wicked thing .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	14	But he refused to listen to her , and since he was stronger than she , he raped her .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	15	Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred . In fact , he hated her more than he had loved her . Amnon said to her , ‘ Get up and get out ! ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	16	‘ No ! ’ she said to him . ‘ Sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me. ’ But he refused to listen to her .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	17	He called his personal servant and said , ‘ Get this woman out of my sight and bolt the door after her. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	18	So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her . She was wearing an ornate [ a ] robe , for this was the kind of garment the virgin daughters of the king wore .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	19	. -
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	20	Her brother Absalom said to her , ‘ Has that Amnon , your brother , been with you ? Be quiet for now , my sister ; he is your brother . Don ’ t take this thing to heart. ’ And Tamar lived in her brother Absalom ’ s house , a desolate woman .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	21	When King David heard all this , he was furious .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	22	And Absalom never said a word to Amnon , either good or bad ; he hated Amnon because he had disgraced his sister Tamar . Absalom kills Amnon
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	23	Two years later , when Absalom ’ s sheep-shearers were at Baal Hazor near the border of Ephraim , he invited all the king ’ s sons to come there .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	24	Absalom went to the king and said , ‘ Your servant has had shearers come . Will the king and his attendants please join me ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	25	‘ No , my son , ’ the king replied . ‘ All of us should not go ; we would only be a burden to you. ’ Although Absalom urged him , he still refused to go but gave him his blessing .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	26	Then Absalom said , ‘ If not , please let my brother Amnon come with us. ’ The king asked him , ‘ Why should he go with you ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	27	But Absalom urged him , so he sent with him Amnon and the rest of the king ’ s sons .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	28	Absalom ordered his men , ‘ Listen ! When Amnon is in high spirits from drinking wine and I say to you , “ Strike Amnon down , ” then kill him . Don ’ t be afraid . Haven ’ t I given you this order ? Be strong and brave. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	29	So Absalom ’ s men did to Amnon what Absalom had ordered . Then all the king ’ s sons got up , mounted their mules and fled .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	30	While they were on their way , the report came to David : ‘ Absalom has struck down all the king ’ s sons ; not one of them is left. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	31	The king stood up , tore his clothes and lay down on the ground ; and all his attendants stood by with their clothes torn .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	32	But Jonadab son of Shimeah , David ’ s brother , said , ‘ My lord should not think that they killed all the princes ; only Amnon is dead . This has been Absalom ’ s express intention ever since the day that Amnon raped his sister Tamar .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	33	My lord the king should not be concerned about the report that all the king ’ s sons are dead . Only Amnon is dead. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	34	Meanwhile , Absalom had fled . Now the man standing watch looked up and saw many people on the road west of him , coming down the side of the hill . The watchman went and told the king , ‘ I see men in the direction of Horonaim , on the side of the hill. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	35	Jonadab said to the king , ‘ See , the king ’ s sons have come ; it has happened just as your servant said. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	36	As he finished speaking , the king ’ s sons came in , wailing loudly . The king , too , and all his attendants wept very bitterly .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	37	Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud , the king of Geshur . But King David mourned many days for his son .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	13	38	After Absalom fled and went to Geshur , he stayed there for three years .

NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	14	Like water spilled on the ground , which can not be recovered , so we must die . But that is not what God desires ; rather , he devises ways so that a banished person does not remain banished from him .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	3	Then go to the king and speak these words to him. ’ And Joab put the words in her mouth .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	4	When the woman from Tekoa went [ a ] to the king , she fell with her face to the ground to pay him honour , and she said , ‘ Help me , Your Majesty ! ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	5	The king asked her , ‘ What is troubling you ? ’ She said , ‘ I am a widow ; my husband is dead .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	6	I your servant had two sons . They got into a fight with each other in the field , and no one was there to separate them . One struck the other and killed him .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	7	Now the whole clan has risen up against your servant ; they say , “ Hand over the one who struck his brother down , so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed ; then we will get rid of the heir as well. ” They would put out the only burning coal I have left , leaving my husband neither name nor descendant on the face of the earth. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	8	The king said to the woman , ‘ Go home , and I will issue an order on your behalf. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	9	But the woman from Tekoa said to him , ‘ Let my lord the king pardon me and my family , and let the king and his throne be without guilt. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	10	The king replied , ‘ If anyone says anything to you , bring them to me , and they will not bother you again. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	11	She said , ‘ Then let the king invoke the Lord his God to prevent the avenger of blood from adding to the destruction , so that my son shall not be destroyed. ’ ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , ’ he said , ‘ not one hair of your son ’ s head will fall to the ground. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	12	Then the woman said , ‘ Let your servant speak a word to my lord the king. ’ ‘ Speak , ’ he replied .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	13	The woman said , ‘ Why then have you devised a thing like this against the people of God ? When the king says this , does he not convict himself , for the king has not brought back his banished son ?
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	15	‘ And now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid . Your servant thought , “ I will speak to the king ; perhaps he will grant his servant ’ s request .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	16	Perhaps the king will agree to deliver his servant from the hand of the man who is trying to cut off both me and my son from God ’ s inheritance. ”
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	17	‘ And now your servant says , “ May the word of my lord the king secure my inheritance , for my lord the king is like an angel of God in discerning good and evil . May the Lord your God be with you. ” ’

NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	19	The king asked , ‘ Isn ’ t the hand of Joab with you in all this ? ’ The woman answered , ‘ As surely as you live , my lord the king , no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything my lord the king says . Yes , it was your servant Joab who instructed me to do this and who put all these words into the mouth of your servant .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	20	Your servant Joab did this to change the present situation . My lord has wisdom like that of an angel of God – he knows everything that happens in the land. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	21	The king said to Joab , ‘ Very well , I will do it . Go , bring back the young man Absalom. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	22	Joab fell with his face to the ground to pay him honour , and he blessed the king . Joab said , ‘ Today your servant knows that he has found favour in your eyes , my lord the king , because the king has granted his servant ’ s request. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	23	Then Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	24	But the king said , ‘ He must go to his own house ; he must not see my face. ’ So Absalom went to his own house and did not see the face of the king .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	25	In all Israel there was not a man so highly praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom . From the top of his head to the sole of his foot there was no blemish in him .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	26	Whenever he cut the hair of his head – he used to cut his hair once a year because it became too heavy for him – he would weigh it , and its weight was two hundred shekels [ b ] by the royal standard .

NIVUK	2%20Samuel	14	30	Then he said to his servants , ‘ Look , Joab ’ s field is next to mine , and he has barley there . Go and set it on fire. ’ So Absalom ’ s servants set the field on fire .

NIVUK	2%20Samuel	17	14	Absalom and all the men of Israel said , ‘ The advice of Hushai the Arkite is better than that of Ahithophel. ’ For the Lord had determined to frustrate the good advice of Ahithophel in order to bring disaster on Absalom .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	17	15	Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar , the priests , ‘ Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel to do such and such , but I have advised them to do so and so .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	17	16	Now send a message at once and tell David , “ Do not spend the night at the fords in the wilderness ; cross over without fail , or the king and all the people with him will be swallowed up. ” ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	17	18	But a young man saw them and told Absalom . So the two of them left at once and went to the house of a man in Bahurim . He had a well in his courtyard , and they climbed down into it .

NIVUK	2%20Samuel	24	9	Joab reported the number of the fighting men to the king : in Israel there were eight hundred thousand able-bodied men who could handle a sword , and in Judah five hundred thousand .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	24	10	David was conscience-stricken after he had counted the fighting men , and he said to the Lord , ‘ I have sinned greatly in what I have done . Now , Lord , I beg you , take away the guilt of your servant . I have done a very foolish thing. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	24	11	Before David got up the next morning , the word of the Lord had come to Gad the prophet , David ’ s seer :
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	24	12	‘ Go and tell David , “ This is what the Lord says : I am giving you three options . Choose one of them for me to carry out against you. ” ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	24	13	So Gad went to David and said to him , ‘ Shall there come on you three [ b ] years of famine in your land ? Or three months of fleeing from your enemies while they pursue you ? Or three days of plague in your land ? Now then , think it over and decide how I should answer the one who sent me. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	24	14	David said to Gad , ‘ I am in deep distress . Let us fall into the hands of the Lord , for his mercy is great ; but do not let me fall into human hands. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	24	15	So the Lord sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the end of the time designated , and seventy thousand of the people from Dan to Beersheba died .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	24	16	When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem , the Lord relented concerning the disaster and said to the angel who was afflicting the people , ‘ Enough ! Withdraw your hand. ’ The angel of the Lord was then at the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	24	17	When David saw the angel who was striking down the people , he said to the Lord , ‘ I have sinned ; I , the shepherd , [ c ] have done wrong . These are but sheep . What have they done ? Let your hand fall on me and my family. ’ David builds an altar
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	24	18	On that day Gad went to David and said to him , ‘ Go up and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	24	19	So David went up , as the Lord had commanded through Gad .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	24	20	When Araunah looked and saw the king and his officials coming towards him , he went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	24	21	Araunah said , ‘ Why has my lord the king come to his servant ? ’ ‘ To buy your threshing-floor , ’ David answered , ‘ so that I can build an altar to the Lord , that the plague on the people may be stopped. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	24	22	Araunah said to David , ‘ Let my lord the king take whatever he wishes and offer it up . Here are oxen for the burnt offering , and here are threshing-sledges and ox yokes for the wood .
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	24	23	Your Majesty , Araunah [ d ] gives all this to the king. ’ Araunah also said to him , ‘ May the Lord your God accept you. ’
NIVUK	2%20Samuel	24	25	David built an altar to the Lord there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings . Then the Lord answered his prayer on behalf of the land , and the plague on Israel was stopped . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	2	So his attendants said to him , ‘ Let us look for a young virgin to serve the king and take care of him . She can lie beside him so that our lord the king may keep warm. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	3	Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful young woman and found Abishag , a Shunammite , and brought her to the king .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	4	The woman was very beautiful ; she took care of the king and waited on him , but the king had no sexual relations with her .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	5	Now Adonijah , whose mother was Haggith , put himself forward and said , ‘ I will be king. ’ So he got chariots and horses [ a ] ready , with fifty men to run ahead of him .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	6	( His father had never rebuked him by asking , ‘ Why do you behave as you do ? ’ He was also very handsome and was born next after Absalom . )
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	7	Adonijah conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest , and they gave him their support .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	8	But Zadok the priest , Benaiah son of Jehoiada , Nathan the prophet , Shimei and Rei and David ’ s special guard did not join Adonijah .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	9	Adonijah then sacrificed sheep , cattle and fattened calves at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel . He invited all his brothers , the king ’ s sons , and all the royal officials of Judah ,
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	10	but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the special guard or his brother Solomon .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	11	Then Nathan asked Bathsheba , Solomon ’ s mother , ‘ Have you not heard that Adonijah , the son of Haggith , has become king , and our lord David knows nothing about it ?
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	12	Now then , let me advise you how you can save your own life and the life of your son Solomon .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	13	Go in to King David and say to him , “ My lord the king , did you not swear to me your servant : ‘ Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me , and he will sit on my throne ’ ? Why then has Adonijah become king ? ”
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	14	While you are still there talking to the king , I will come in and add my word to what you have said. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	15	So Bathsheba went to see the aged king in his room , where Abishag the Shunammite was attending him .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	16	Bathsheba bowed down , prostrating herself before the king . ‘ What is it you want ? ’ the king asked .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	17	She said to him , ‘ My lord , you yourself swore to me your servant by the Lord your God : “ Solomon your son shall become king after me , and he will sit on my throne. ”
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	18	But now Adonijah has become king , and you , my lord the king , do not know about it .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	19	He has sacrificed great numbers of cattle , fattened calves , and sheep , and has invited all the king ’ s sons , Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army , but he has not invited Solomon your servant .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	20	My lord the king , the eyes of all Israel are on you , to learn from you who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	21	Otherwise , as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his ancestors , I and my son Solomon will be treated as criminals. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	22	While she was still speaking with the king , Nathan the prophet arrived .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	23	And the king was told , ‘ Nathan the prophet is here. ’ So he went before the king and bowed with his face to the ground .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	24	Nathan said , ‘ Have you , my lord the king , declared that Adonijah shall be king after you , and that he will sit on your throne ?
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	25	Today he has gone down and sacrificed great numbers of cattle , fattened calves , and sheep . He has invited all the king ’ s sons , the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest . At this very moment they are eating and drinking with him and saying , “ Long live King Adonijah ! ”
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	26	But me your servant , and Zadok the priest , and Benaiah son of Jehoiada , and your servant Solomon he did not invite .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	27	Is this something my lord the king has done without letting his servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him ? ’ David makes Solomon king
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	28	Then King David said , ‘ Call in Bathsheba. ’ So she came into the king ’ s presence and stood before him .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	29	The king then took an oath : ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , who has delivered me out of every trouble ,
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	30	I will surely carry out this very day what I swore to you by the Lord , the God of Israel : Solomon your son shall be king after me , and he will sit on my throne in my place. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	31	Then Bathsheba bowed down with her face to the ground , prostrating herself before the king , and said , ‘ May my lord King David live for ever ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	32	King David said , ‘ Call in Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet and Benaiah son of Jehoiada. ’ When they came before the king ,
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	33	he said to them : ‘ Take your lord ’ s servants with you and put Solomon my son on my own mule and take him down to Gihon .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	34	There shall Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel . Blow the trumpet and shout , “ Long live King Solomon ! ”
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	35	Then you are to go up with him , and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place . I have appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	36	Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king , ‘ Amen ! May the Lord , the God of my lord the king , so declare it .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	37	As the Lord was with my lord the king , so may he be with Solomon to make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	38	So Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , Benaiah son of Jehoiada , the Kerethites and the Pelethites went down and put Solomon on King David ’ s mule , and they escorted him to Gihon .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	39	Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the sacred tent and anointed Solomon . Then they sounded the trumpet and all the people shouted , ‘ Long live King Solomon ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	40	And all the people went up after him , playing pipes and rejoicing greatly , so that the ground shook with the sound .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	41	Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they were finishing their feast . On hearing the sound of the trumpet , Joab asked , ‘ What ’ s the meaning of all the noise in the city ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	42	Even as he was speaking , Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived . Adonijah said , ‘ Come in . A worthy man like you must be bringing good news. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	43	‘ Not at all ! ’ Jonathan answered . ‘ Our lord King David has made Solomon king .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	44	The king has sent with him Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , Benaiah son of Jehoiada , the Kerethites and the Pelethites , and they have put him on the king ’ s mule ,
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	45	and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon . From there they have gone up cheering , and the city resounds with it . That ’ s the noise you hear .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	46	Moreover , Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	47	Also , the royal officials have come to congratulate our lord King David , saying , “ May your God make Solomon ’ s name more famous than yours and his throne greater than yours ! ” And the king bowed in worship on his bed
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	48	and said , “ Praise be to the Lord , the God of Israel , who has allowed my eyes to see a successor on my throne today. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	49	At this , all Adonijah ’ s guests rose in alarm and dispersed .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	50	But Adonijah , in fear of Solomon , went and took hold of the horns of the altar .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	51	Then Solomon was told , ‘ Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon and is clinging to the horns of the altar . He says , “ Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	52	Solomon replied , ‘ If he shows himself to be worthy , not a hair of his head will fall to the ground ; but if evil is found in him , he will die. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	1	53	Then King Solomon sent men , and they brought him down from the altar . And Adonijah came and bowed down to King Solomon , and Solomon said , ‘ Go to your home. ’ Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	2	‘ I am about to go the way of all the earth , ’ he said . ‘ So be strong , act like a man ,
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	3	and observe what the Lord your God requires : walk in obedience to him , and keep his decrees and commands , his laws and regulations , as written in the Law of Moses . Do this so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	4	and that the Lord may keep his promise to me : “ If your descendants watch how they live , and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul , you will never fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel. ”
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	5	‘ Now you yourself know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me – what he did to the two commanders of Israel ’ s armies , Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether . He killed them , shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle , and with that blood he stained the belt round his waist and the sandals on his feet .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	6	Deal with him according to your wisdom , but do not let his grey head go down to the grave in peace .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	7	‘ But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table . They stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	8	“ And remember , you have with you Shimei son of Gera , the Benjaminite from Bahurim , who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to Mahanaim . When he came down to meet me at the Jordan , I swore to him by the Lord : “ I will not put you to death by the sword. ”
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	9	But now , do not consider him innocent . You are a man of wisdom ; you will know what to do to him . Bring his grey head down to the grave in blood. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	10	Then David rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	11	He had reigned for forty years over Israel – seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	12	So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David , and his rule was firmly established . Solomon ’ s throne established
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	13	Now Adonijah , the son of Haggith , went to Bathsheba , Solomon ’ s mother . Bathsheba asked him , ‘ Do you come peacefully ? ’ He answered , ‘ Yes , peacefully. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	14	Then he added , ‘ I have something to say to you. ’ ‘ You may say it , ’ she replied .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	15	‘ As you know , ’ he said , ‘ the kingdom was mine . All Israel looked to me as their king . But things changed , and the kingdom has gone to my brother ; for it has come to him from the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	16	Now I have one request to make of you . Do not refuse me. ’ ‘ You may make it , ’ she said .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	17	So he continued , ‘ Please ask King Solomon – he will not refuse you – to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	18	‘ Very well , ’ Bathsheba replied , ‘ I will speak to the king for you. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	19	When Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah , the king stood up to meet her , bowed down to her and sat down on his throne . He had a throne brought for the king ’ s mother , and she sat down at his right hand .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	20	‘ I have one small request to make of you , ’ she said . ‘ Do not refuse me. ’ The king replied , ‘ Make it , my mother ; I will not refuse you. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	21	So she said , ‘ Let Abishag the Shunammite be given in marriage to your brother Adonijah. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	22	King Solomon answered his mother , ‘ Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah ? You might as well request the kingdom for him – after all , he is my older brother – yes , for him and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	23	Then King Solomon swore by the Lord : ‘ May God deal with me , be it ever so severely , if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this request !
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	24	And now , as surely as the Lord lives – he who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised – Adonijah shall be put to death today ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	25	So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada , and he struck down Adonijah and he died .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	26	To Abiathar the priest the king said , ‘ Go back to your fields in Anathoth . You deserve to die , but I will not put you to death now , because you carried the ark of the Sovereign Lord before my father David and shared all my father ’ s hardships. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	27	So Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood of the Lord , fulfilling the word the Lord had spoken at Shiloh about the house of Eli .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	28	When the news reached Joab , who had conspired with Adonijah though not with Absalom , he fled to the tent of the Lord and took hold of the horns of the altar .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	29	King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the tent of the Lord and was beside the altar . Then Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada , ‘ Go , strike him down ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	30	So Benaiah entered the tent of the Lord and said to Joab , ‘ The king says , “ Come out ! ” ’ But he answered , ‘ No , I will die here. ’ Benaiah reported to the king , ‘ This is how Joab answered me. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	31	Then the king commanded Benaiah , ‘ Do as he says . Strike him down and bury him , and so clear me and my whole family of the guilt of the innocent blood that Joab shed .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	32	The Lord will repay him for the blood he shed , because without my father David knowing it he attacked two men and killed them with the sword . Both of them – Abner son of Ner , commander of Israel ’ s army , and Amasa son of Jether , commander of Judah ’ s army – were better men and more upright than he .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	33	May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of Joab and his descendants for ever . But on David and his descendants , his house and his throne , may there be the Lord ’ s peace for ever. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	34	So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck down Joab and killed him , and he was buried at his home out in the country .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	35	The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab ’ s position and replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	36	Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him , ‘ Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there , but do not go anywhere else .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	37	The day you leave and cross the Kidron Valley , you can be sure you will die ; your blood will be on your own head. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	38	Shimei answered the king , ‘ What you say is good . Your servant will do as my lord the king has said. ’ And Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	39	But three years later , two of Shimei ’ s slaves ran off to Achish son of Maakah , king of Gath , and Shimei was told , ‘ Your slaves are in Gath. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	40	At this , he saddled his donkey and went to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves . So Shimei went away and brought the slaves back from Gath .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	41	When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned ,
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	42	the king summoned Shimei and said to him , ‘ Did I not make you swear by the Lord and warn you , “ On the day you leave to go anywhere else , you can be sure you will die ” ? At that time you said to me , “ What you say is good . I will obey. ”
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	43	Why then did you not keep your oath to the Lord and obey the command I gave you ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	44	The king also said to Shimei , ‘ You know in your heart all the wrong you did to my father David . Now the Lord will repay you for your wrongdoing .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	45	But King Solomon will be blessed , and David ’ s throne will remain secure before the Lord for ever. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	2	46	Then the king gave the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada , and he went out and struck Shimei down and he died . The kingdom was now established in Solomon ’ s hands . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	3	Solomon showed his love for the Lord by walking according to the instructions given him by his father David , except that he offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	2	The people , however , were still sacrificing at the high places , because a temple had not yet been built for the Name of the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	4	The king went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices , for that was the most important high place , and Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	5	At Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon during the night in a dream , and God said , ‘ Ask for whatever you want me to give you. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	6	Solomon answered , ‘ You have shown great kindness to your servant , my father David , because he was faithful to you and righteous and upright in heart . You have continued this great kindness to him and have given him a son to sit on his throne this very day .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	7	‘ Now , Lord my God , you have made your servant king in place of my father David . But I am only a little child and do not know how to carry out my duties .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	8	Your servant is here among the people you have chosen , a great people , too numerous to count or number .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	9	So give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong . For who is able to govern this great people of yours ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	10	The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for this .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	11	So God said to him , ‘ Since you have asked for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself , nor have asked for the death of your enemies but for discernment in administering justice ,
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	12	I will do what you have asked . I will give you a wise and discerning heart , so that there will never have been anyone like you , nor will there ever be .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	13	Moreover , I will give you what you have not asked for – both wealth and honour – so that in your lifetime you will have no equal among kings .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	14	And if you walk in obedience to me and keep my decrees and commands as David your father did , I will give you a long life. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	15	Then Solomon awoke – and he realised it had been a dream . He returned to Jerusalem , stood before the ark of the Lord ’ s covenant and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings . Then he gave a feast for all his court . A wise ruling
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	16	Now two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	17	One of them said , ‘ Pardon me , my lord . This woman and I live in the same house . I had a baby while she was there with me .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	18	The third day after my child was born , this woman also had a baby . We were alone ; there was no one in the house but the two of us .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	19	‘ During the night this woman ’ s son died because she lay on him .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	20	So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while I your servant was asleep . She put him by her breast and put her dead son by my breast .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	21	The next morning , I got up to nurse my son – and he was dead ! But when I looked at him closely in the morning light , I saw that it wasn ’ t the son I had borne. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	22	The other woman said , ‘ No ! The living one is my son ; the dead one is yours. ’ But the first one insisted , ‘ No ! The dead one is yours ; the living one is mine. ’ And so they argued before the king .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	23	The king said , ‘ This one says , “ My son is alive and your son is dead , ” while that one says , “ No ! Your son is dead and mine is alive. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	24	Then the king said , ‘ Bring me a sword. ’ So they brought a sword for the king .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	25	He then gave an order : ‘ Cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	26	The woman whose son was alive was deeply moved out of love for her son and said to the king , ‘ Please , my lord , give her the living baby ! Don ’ t kill him ! ’ But the other said , ‘ Neither I nor you shall have him . Cut him in two ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	27	Then the king gave his ruling : ‘ Give the living baby to the first woman . Do not kill him ; she is his mother. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	3	28	When all Israel heard the verdict the king had given , they held the king in awe , because they saw that he had wisdom from God to administer justice . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	1%20Kings	8	54	When Solomon had finished all these prayers and supplications to the Lord , he rose from before the altar of the Lord , where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out towards heaven .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	8	55	He stood and blessed the whole assembly of Israel in a loud voice , saying :

NIVUK	1%20Kings	8	62	Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	8	63	Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the Lord : twenty-two thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats . So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the temple of the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	8	64	On that same day the king consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the Lord , and there he offered burnt offerings , grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings , because the bronze altar that stood before the Lord was too small to hold the burnt offerings , the grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	8	65	So Solomon observed the festival at that time , and all Israel with him – a vast assembly , people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt . They celebrated it before the Lord our God for seven days and seven days more , fourteen days in all .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	8	66	On the following day he sent the people away . They blessed the king and then went home , joyful and glad in heart for all the good things the Lord had done for his servant David and his people Israel . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	11	So the Lord said to Solomon , ‘ Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees , which I commanded you , I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	2	They were from nations about which the Lord had told the Israelites , ‘ You must not intermarry with them , because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods. ’ Nevertheless , Solomon held fast to them in love .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	3	He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines , and his wives led him astray .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	4	As Solomon grew old , his wives turned his heart after other gods , and his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God , as the heart of David his father had been .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	5	He followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians , and Molek the detestable god of the Ammonites .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	6	So Solomon did evil in the eyes of the Lord ; he did not follow the Lord completely , as David his father had done .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	7	On a hill east of Jerusalem , Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab , and for Molek the detestable god of the Ammonites .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	8	He did the same for all his foreign wives , who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	9	The Lord became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the Lord , the God of Israel , who had appeared to him twice .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	10	Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods , Solomon did not keep the Lord ’ s command .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	12	Nevertheless , for the sake of David your father , I will not do it during your lifetime . I will tear it out of the hand of your son .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	13	Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom from him , but will give him one tribe for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem , which I have chosen. ’ Solomon ’ s adversaries
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	14	Then the Lord raised up against Solomon an adversary , Hadad the Edomite , from the royal line of Edom .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	15	Earlier when David was fighting with Edom , Joab the commander of the army , who had gone up to bury the dead , had struck down all the men in Edom .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	16	Joab and all the Israelites stayed there for six months , until they had destroyed all the men in Edom .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	17	But Hadad , still only a boy , fled to Egypt with some Edomite officials who had served his father .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	18	They set out from Midian and went to Paran . Then taking people from Paran with them , they went to Egypt , to Pharaoh king of Egypt , who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	19	Pharaoh was so pleased with Hadad that he gave him a sister of his own wife , Queen Tahpenes , in marriage .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	20	The sister of Tahpenes bore him a son named Genubath , whom Tahpenes brought up in the royal palace . There Genubath lived with Pharaoh ’ s own children .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	21	While he was in Egypt , Hadad heard that David rested with his ancestors and that Joab the commander of the army was also dead . Then Hadad said to Pharaoh , ‘ Let me go , so that I may return to my own country. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	22	‘ What have you lacked here that you want to go back to your own country ? ’ Pharaoh asked . ‘ Nothing , ’ Hadad replied , ‘ but do let me go ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	23	And God raised up against Solomon another adversary , Rezon son of Eliada , who had fled from his master , Hadadezer king of Zobah .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	24	When David destroyed Zobah ’ s army , Rezon gathered a band of men around him and became their leader ; they went to Damascus , where they settled and took control .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	25	Rezon was Israel ’ s adversary as long as Solomon lived , adding to the trouble caused by Hadad . So Rezon ruled in Aram and was hostile towards Israel . Jeroboam rebels against Solomon
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	26	Also , Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against the king . He was one of Solomon ’ s officials , an Ephraimite from Zeredah , and his mother was a widow named Zeruah .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	27	Here is the account of how he rebelled against the king : Solomon had built the terraces [ a ] and had filled in the gap in the wall of the city of David his father .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	28	Now Jeroboam was a man of standing , and when Solomon saw how well the young man did his work , he put him in charge of the whole labour force of the tribes of Joseph .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	29	About that time Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem , and Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh met him on the way , wearing a new cloak . The two of them were alone out in the country ,
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	30	and Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	31	Then he said to Jeroboam , ‘ Take ten pieces for yourself , for this is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : “ See , I am going to tear the kingdom out of Solomon ’ s hand and give you ten tribes .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	32	But for the sake of my servant David and the city of Jerusalem , which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel , he will have one tribe .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	33	I will do this because they have [ b ] forsaken me and worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians , Chemosh the god of the Moabites , and Molek the god of the Ammonites , and have not walked in obedience to me , nor done what is right in my eyes , nor kept my decrees and laws as David , Solomon ’ s father , did .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	34	‘ “ But I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon ’ s hand ; I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David my servant , whom I chose and who obeyed my commands and decrees .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	35	I will take the kingdom from his son ’ s hands and give you ten tribes .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	36	I will give one tribe to his son so that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem , the city where I chose to put my Name .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	37	However , as for you , I will take you , and you will rule over all that your heart desires ; you will be king over Israel .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	38	If you do whatever I command you and walk in obedience to me and do what is right in my eyes by obeying my decrees and commands , as David my servant did , I will be with you . I will build you a dynasty as enduring as the one I built for David and will give Israel to you .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	39	I will humble David ’ s descendants because of this , but not for ever. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	11	40	Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam , but Jeroboam fled to Egypt , to Shishak the king , and stayed there until Solomon ’ s death . Solomon ’ s death

NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	12	Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam , as the king had said , ‘ Come back to me in three days. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	2	When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this ( he was still in Egypt , where he had fled from King Solomon ) , he returned from [ a ] Egypt .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	3	So they sent for Jeroboam , and he and the whole assembly of Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him :
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	4	‘ Your father put a heavy yoke on us , but now lighten the harsh labour and the heavy yoke he put on us , and we will serve you. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	5	Rehoboam answered , ‘ Go away for three days and then come back to me. ’ So the people went away .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	6	Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime . ‘ How would you advise me to answer these people ? ’ he asked .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	7	They replied , ‘ If today you will be a servant to these people and serve them and give them a favourable answer , they will always be your servants. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	8	But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	9	He asked them , ‘ What is your advice ? How should we answer these people who say to me , “ Lighten the yoke your father put on us ” ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	10	The young men who had grown up with him replied , ‘ These people have said to you , “ Your father put a heavy yoke on us , but make our yoke lighter. ” Now tell them , “ My little finger is thicker than my father ’ s waist .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	11	My father laid on you a heavy yoke ; I will make it even heavier . My father scourged you with whips ; I will scourge you with scorpions. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	13	The king answered the people harshly . Rejecting the advice given him by the elders ,
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	14	he followed the advice of the young men and said , ‘ My father made your yoke heavy ; I will make it even heavier . My father scourged you with whips ; I will scourge you with scorpions. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	15	So the king did not listen to the people , for this turn of events was from the Lord , to fulfil the word the Lord had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	16	When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them , they answered the king : ‘ What share do we have in David , what part in Jesse ’ s son ? To your tents , Israel ! Look after your own house , David ! ’ So the Israelites went home .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	17	But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah , Rehoboam still ruled over them .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	18	King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram , [ b ] who was in charge of forced labour , but all Israel stoned him to death . King Rehoboam , however , managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	19	So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	20	When all the Israelites heard that Jeroboam had returned , they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel . Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	21	When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem , he mustered all Judah and the tribe of Benjamin – a hundred and eighty thousand able young men – to go to war against Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam son of Solomon .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	22	But this word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God :
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	23	‘ Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah , to all Judah and Benjamin , and to the rest of the people ,
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	24	“ This is what the Lord says : do not go up to fight against your brothers , the Israelites . Go home , every one of you , for this is my doing. ” ’ So they obeyed the word of the Lord and went home again , as the Lord had ordered . Golden calves at Bethel and Dan
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	25	Then Jeroboam fortified Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there . From there he went out and built up Peniel . [ c ]
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	26	Jeroboam thought to himself , ‘ The kingdom is now likely to revert to the house of David .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	27	If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem , they will again give their allegiance to their lord , Rehoboam king of Judah . They will kill me and return to King Rehoboam. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	28	After seeking advice , the king made two golden calves . He said to the people , ‘ It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem . Here are your gods , Israel , who brought you up out of Egypt. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	29	One he set up in Bethel , and the other in Dan .

NIVUK	1%20Kings	12	31	Jeroboam built shrines on high places and appointed priests from all sorts of people , even though they were not Levites .

NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	4	When King Jeroboam heard what the man of God cried out against the altar at Bethel , he stretched out his hand from the altar and said , ‘ Seize him ! ’ But the hand he stretched out towards the man shrivelled up , so that he could not pull it back .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	5	Also , the altar was split apart and its ashes poured out according to the sign given by the man of God by the word of the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	6	Then the king said to the man of God , ‘ Intercede with the Lord your God and pray for me that my hand may be restored. ’ So the man of God interceded with the Lord , and the king ’ s hand was restored and became as it was before .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	7	The king said to the man of God , ‘ Come home with me for a meal , and I will give you a gift. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	8	But the man of God answered the king , ‘ Even if you were to give me half your possessions , I would not go with you , nor would I eat bread or drink water here .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	9	For I was commanded by the word of the Lord : “ You must not eat bread or drink water or return by the way you came. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	10	So he took another road and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	11	Now there was a certain old prophet living in Bethel , whose sons came and told him all that the man of God had done there that day . They also told their father what he had said to the king .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	12	Their father asked them , ‘ Which way did he go ? ’ And his sons showed him which road the man of God from Judah had taken .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	14	and rode after the man of God . He found him sitting under an oak tree and asked , ‘ Are you the man of God who came from Judah ? ’ ‘ I am , ’ he replied .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	15	So the prophet said to him , ‘ Come home with me and eat. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	16	The man of God said , ‘ I can not turn back and go with you , nor can I eat bread or drink water with you in this place .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	17	I have been told by the word of the Lord : “ You must not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way you came. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	18	The old prophet answered , ‘ I too am a prophet , as you are . And an angel said to me by the word of the Lord : “ Bring him back with you to your house so that he may eat bread and drink water. ” ’ ( But he was lying to him . )
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	19	So the man of God returned with him and ate and drank in his house .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	20	While they were sitting at the table , the word of the Lord came to the old prophet who had brought him back .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	21	He cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah , ‘ This is what the Lord says : “ You have defied the word of the Lord and have not kept the command the Lord your God gave you .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	22	You came back and ate bread and drank water in the place where he told you not to eat or drink . Therefore your body will not be buried in the tomb of your ancestors. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	23	When the man of God had finished eating and drinking , the prophet who had brought him back saddled his donkey for him .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	24	As he went on his way , a lion met him on the road and killed him , and his body was left lying on the road , with both the donkey and the lion standing beside it .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	25	Some people who passed by saw the body lying there , with the lion standing beside the body , and they went and reported it in the city where the old prophet lived .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	26	When the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard of it , he said , ‘ It is the man of God who defied the word of the Lord . The Lord has given him over to the lion , which has mauled him and killed him , as the word of the Lord had warned him. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	27	The prophet said to his sons , ‘ Saddle the donkey for me , ’ and they did so .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	28	Then he went out and found the body lying on the road , with the donkey and the lion standing beside it . The lion had neither eaten the body nor mauled the donkey .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	29	So the prophet picked up the body of the man of God , laid it on the donkey , and brought it back to his own city to mourn for him and bury him .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	30	Then he laid the body in his own tomb , and they mourned over him and said , ‘ Alas , my brother ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	31	After burying him , he said to his sons , ‘ When I die , bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried ; lay my bones beside his bones .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	32	For the message he declared by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel and against all the shrines on the high places in the towns of Samaria will certainly come true. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	13	33	Even after this , Jeroboam did not change his evil ways , but once more appointed priests for the high places from all sorts of people . Anyone who wanted to become a priest he consecrated for the high places .

NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	1	Kings 18:32 That is , probably about
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	18	‘ I have not made trouble for Israel , ’ Elijah replied . ‘ But you and your father ’ s family have . You have abandoned the Lord ’ s commands and have followed the Baals .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	2	So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab . Now the famine was severe in Samaria ,
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	3	and Ahab had summoned Obadiah , his palace administrator . ( Obadiah was a devout believer in the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	4	While Jezebel was killing off the Lord ’ s prophets , Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them in two caves , fifty in each , and had supplied them with food and water . )
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	5	Ahab had said to Obadiah , ‘ Go through the land to all the springs and valleys . Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	6	So they divided the land they were to cover , Ahab going in one direction and Obadiah in another .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	7	As Obadiah was walking along , Elijah met him . Obadiah recognised him , bowed down to the ground , and said , ‘ Is it really you , my lord Elijah ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	8	‘ Yes , ’ he replied . ‘ Go tell your master , “ Elijah is here. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	9	‘ What have I done wrong , ’ asked Obadiah , ‘ that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death ?
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	10	As surely as the Lord your God lives , there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you . And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there , he made them swear they could not find you .

NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	12	I don ’ t know where the Spirit of the Lord may carry you when I leave you . If I go and tell Ahab and he doesn ’ t find you , he will kill me . Yet I your servant have worshipped the Lord since my youth .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	13	Haven ’ t you heard , my lord , what I did while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the Lord ? I hid a hundred of the Lord ’ s prophets in two caves , fifty in each , and supplied them with food and water .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	14	And now you tell me to go to my master and say , “ Elijah is here. ” He will kill me ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	15	Elijah said , ‘ As the Lord Almighty lives , whom I serve , I will surely present myself to Ahab today. ’ Elijah on Mount Carmel
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	16	So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him , and Ahab went to meet Elijah .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	17	When he saw Elijah , he said to him , ‘ Is that you , you troubler of Israel ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	19	Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel . And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah , who eat at Jezebel ’ s table. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	20	So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	21	Elijah went before the people and said , ‘ How long will you waver between two opinions ? If the Lord is God , follow him ; but if Baal is God , follow him. ’ But the people said nothing .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	22	Then Elijah said to them , ‘ I am the only one of the Lord ’ s prophets left , but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	23	Get two bulls for us . Let Baal ’ s prophets choose one for themselves , and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it . I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	24	Then you call on the name of your god , and I will call on the name of the Lord . The god who answers by fire – he is God. ’ Then all the people said , ‘ What you say is good. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	25	Elijah said to the prophets of Baal , ‘ Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first , since there are so many of you . Call on the name of your god , but do not light the fire. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	26	So they took the bull that was given to them and prepared it . Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon . ‘ Baal , answer us ! ’ they shouted . But there was no response ; no one answered . And they danced around the altar they had made .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	27	At noon Elijah began to taunt them . ‘ Shout louder ! ’ he said . ‘ Surely he is a god ! Perhaps he is deep in thought , or busy , or travelling . Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	28	So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears , as was their custom , until their blood flowed .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	29	Midday passed , and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice . But there was no response , no one answered , no one paid attention .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	30	Then Elijah said to all the people , ‘ Come here to me. ’ They came to him , and he repaired the altar of the Lord , which had been torn down .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	31	Elijah took twelve stones , one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob , to whom the word of the Lord had come , saying , ‘ Your name shall be Israel. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	32	With the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord , and he dug a trench round it large enough to hold two seahs [ a ] of seed .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	33	He arranged the wood , cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood . Then he said to them , ‘ Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	34	‘ Do it again , ’ he said , and they did it again . ‘ Do it a third time , ’ he ordered , and they did it the third time .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	35	The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	36	At the time of sacrifice , the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed : ‘ Lord , the God of Abraham , Isaac and Israel , let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	37	Answer me , Lord , answer me , so these people will know that you , Lord , are God , and that you are turning their hearts back again. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	38	Then the fire of the Lord fell and burned up the sacrifice , the wood , the stones and the soil , and also licked up the water in the trench .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	39	When all the people saw this , they fell prostrate and cried , ‘ The Lord – he is God ! The Lord – he is God ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	40	Then Elijah commanded them , ‘ Seize the prophets of Baal . Don ’ t let anyone get away ! ’ They seized them , and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	41	And Elijah said to Ahab , ‘ Go , eat and drink , for there is the sound of a heavy rain. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	42	So Ahab went off to eat and drink , but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel , bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	43	‘ Go and look toward the sea , ’ he told his servant . And he went up and looked . ‘ There is nothing there , ’ he said . Seven times Elijah said , ‘ Go back. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	44	The seventh time the servant reported , ‘ A cloud as small as a man ’ s hand is rising from the sea. ’ So Elijah said , ‘ Go and tell Ahab , “ Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	45	Meanwhile , the sky grew black with clouds , the wind rose , a heavy rainstorm came on and Ahab rode off to Jezreel .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	18	46	The power of the Lord came on Elijah and , tucking his cloak into his belt , he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	1	Kings 19:3 Or Elijah saw Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	19	So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat . He was ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen , and he himself was driving the twelfth pair . Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	2	So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say , ‘ May the gods deal with me , be it ever so severely , if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	3	Elijah was afraid [ a ] and ran for his life . When he came to Beersheba in Judah , he left his servant there ,
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	4	while he himself went a day ’ s journey into the wilderness . He came to a broom bush , sat down under it and prayed that he might die . ‘ I have had enough , Lord , ’ he said . ‘ Take my life ; I am no better than my ancestors. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	5	Then he lay down under the bush and fell asleep . All at once an angel touched him and said , ‘ Get up and eat. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	6	He looked around , and there by his head was some bread baked over hot coals , and a jar of water . He ate and drank and then lay down again .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	7	The angel of the Lord came back a second time and touched him and said , ‘ Get up and eat , for the journey is too much for you. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	8	So he got up and ate and drank . Strengthened by that food , he travelled for forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb , the mountain of God .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	9	There he went into a cave and spent the night . The Lord appears to Elijah And the word of the Lord came to him : ‘ What are you doing here , Elijah ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	10	He replied , ‘ I have been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty . The Israelites have rejected your covenant , torn down your altars , and put your prophets to death with the sword . I am the only one left , and now they are trying to kill me too. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	11	The Lord said , ‘ Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord , for the Lord is about to pass by. ’ Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the Lord , but the Lord was not in the wind . After the wind there was an earthquake , but the Lord was not in the earthquake .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	12	After the earthquake came a fire , but the Lord was not in the fire . And after the fire came a gentle whisper .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	13	When Elijah heard it , he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave . Then a voice said to him , ‘ What are you doing here , Elijah ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	14	He replied , ‘ I have been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty . The Israelites have rejected your covenant , torn down your altars , and put your prophets to death with the sword . I am the only one left , and now they are trying to kill me too. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	15	The Lord said to him , ‘ Go back the way you came , and go to the Desert of Damascus . When you get there , anoint Hazael king over Aram .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	16	Also , anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel , and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	17	Jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of Hazael , and Elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of Jehu .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	18	Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israel – all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and whose mouths have not kissed him. ’ The call of Elisha
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	20	Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah . ‘ Let me kiss my father and mother goodbye , ’ he said , ‘ and then I will come with you. ’ ‘ Go back , ’ Elijah replied . ‘ What have I done to you ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	19	21	So Elisha left him and went back . He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them . He burned the ploughing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people , and they ate . Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his servant . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	20	and each one struck down his opponent . At that , the Arameans fled , with the Israelites in pursuit . But Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on horseback with some of his horsemen .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	2	He sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel , saying , ‘ This is what Ben-Hadad says :
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	3	“ Your silver and gold are mine , and the best of your wives and children are mine. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	4	The king of Israel answered , ‘ Just as you say , my lord the king . I and all I have are yours. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	5	The messengers came again and said , ‘ This is what Ben-Hadad says : “ I sent to demand your silver and gold , your wives and your children .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	6	But about this time tomorrow I am going to send my officials to search your palace and the houses of your officials . They will seize everything you value and carry it away. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	7	The king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said to them , ‘ See how this man is looking for trouble ! When he sent for my wives and my children , my silver and my gold , I did not refuse him. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	8	The elders and the people all answered , ‘ Don ’ t listen to him or agree to his demands. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	9	So he replied to Ben-Hadad ’ s messengers , ‘ Tell my lord the king , “ Your servant will do all you demanded the first time , but this demand I can not meet. ” ’ They left and took the answer back to Ben-Hadad .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	10	Then Ben-Hadad sent another message to Ahab : ‘ May the gods deal with me , be it ever so severely , if enough dust remains in Samaria to give each of my men a handful. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	11	The king of Israel answered , ‘ Tell him : “ One who puts on his armour should not boast like one who takes it off. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	12	Ben-Hadad heard this message while he and the kings were drinking in their tents , [ a ] and he ordered his men : ‘ Prepare to attack. ’ So they prepared to attack the city . Ahab defeats Ben-Hadad
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	13	Meanwhile a prophet came to Ahab king of Israel and announced , ‘ This is what the Lord says : “ Do you see this vast army ? I will give it into your hand today , and then you will know that I am the Lord. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	14	‘ But who will do this ? ’ asked Ahab . The prophet replied , ‘ This is what the Lord says : “ The junior officers under the provincial commanders will do it. ” ’ ‘ And who will start the battle ? ’ he asked . The prophet answered , ‘ You will. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	15	So Ahab summoned the
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	232	junior officers under the provincial commanders . Then he assembled the rest of the Israelites , 7,000 in all .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	16	-
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	32	Wearing sackcloth round their waists and ropes round their heads , they went to the king of Israel and said , ‘ Your servant Ben-Hadad says : “ Please let me live. ” ’ The king answered , ‘ Is he still alive ? He is my brother. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	17	The junior officers under the provincial commanders went out first . Now Ben-Hadad had dispatched scouts , who reported , ‘ Men are advancing from Samaria. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	18	He said , ‘ If they have come out for peace , take them alive ; if they have come out for war , take them alive. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	19	The junior officers under the provincial commanders marched out of the city with the army behind them
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	21	The king of Israel advanced and overpowered the horses and chariots and inflicted heavy losses on the Arameans .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	22	Afterwards , the prophet came to the king of Israel and said , ‘ Strengthen your position and see what must be done , because next spring the king of Aram will attack you again. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	23	Meanwhile , the officials of the king of Aram advised him , ‘ Their gods are gods of the hills . That is why they were too strong for us . But if we fight them on the plains , surely we will be stronger than they .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	24	Do this : remove all the kings from their commands and replace them with other officers .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	25	You must also raise an army like the one you lost – horse for horse and chariot for chariot – so we can fight Israel on the plains . Then surely we will be stronger than they. ’ He agreed with them and acted accordingly .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	26	The next spring Ben-Hadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	27	When the Israelites were also mustered and given provisions , they marched out to meet them . The Israelites camped opposite them like two small flocks of goats , while the Arameans covered the countryside .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	28	The man of God came up and told the king of Israel , ‘ This is what the Lord says : “ Because the Arameans think the Lord is a god of the hills and not a god of the valleys , I will deliver this vast army into your hands , and you will know that I am the Lord. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	29	For seven days they camped opposite each other , and on the seventh day the battle was joined . The Israelites inflicted a hundred thousand casualties on the Aramean foot soldiers in one day .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	30	The rest of them escaped to the city of Aphek , where the wall collapsed on twenty-seven thousand of them . And Ben-Hadad fled to the city and hid in an inner room .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	31	His officials said to him , ‘ Look , we have heard that the kings of Israel are merciful . Let us go to the king of Israel with sackcloth round our waists and ropes round our heads . Perhaps he will spare your life. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	33	The men took this as a good sign and were quick to pick up his word . ‘ Yes , your brother Ben-Hadad ! ’ they said . ‘ Go and get him , ’ the king said . When Ben-Hadad came out , Ahab brought him up into his chariot .

NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	35	By the word of the Lord one of the company of the prophets said to his companion , ‘ Strike me with your weapon , ’ but he refused .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	36	So the prophet said , ‘ Because you have not obeyed the Lord , as soon as you leave me a lion will kill you. ’ And after the man went away , a lion found him and killed him .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	37	The prophet found another man and said , ‘ Strike me , please. ’ So the man struck him and wounded him .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	38	Then the prophet went and stood by the road waiting for the king . He disguised himself with his headband down over his eyes .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	39	As the king passed by , the prophet called out to him , ‘ Your servant went into the thick of the battle , and someone came to me with a captive and said , “ Guard this man . If he is missing , it will be your life for his life , or you must pay a talent [ b ] of silver. ”
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	40	While your servant was busy here and there , the man disappeared. ’ ‘ That is your sentence , ’ the king of Israel said . ‘ You have pronounced it yourself. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	41	Then the prophet quickly removed the headband from his eyes , and the king of Israel recognised him as one of the prophets .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	42	He said to the king , ‘ This is what the Lord says : “ You have set free a man I had determined should die . [ c ] Therefore it is your life for his life , your people for his people. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	20	43	Sullen and angry , the king of Israel went to his palace in Samaria . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	3	But Naboth replied , ‘ The Lord forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my ancestors. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	4	So Ahab went home , sullen and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had said , ‘ I will not give you the inheritance of my ancestors. ’ He lay on his bed sulking and refused to eat .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	5	His wife Jezebel came in and asked him , ‘ Why are you so sullen ? Why won ’ t you eat ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	6	He answered her , ‘ Because I said to Naboth the Jezreelite , “ Sell me your vineyard ; or if you prefer , I will give you another vineyard in its place. ” But he said , “ I will not give you my vineyard. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	7	Jezebel his wife said , ‘ Is this how you act as king over Israel ? Get up and eat ! Cheer up . I ’ ll get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	8	So she wrote letters in Ahab ’ s name , placed his seal on them , and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth ’ s city with him .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	9	In those letters she wrote : ‘ Proclaim a day of fasting and give Naboth a prominent seat among the people .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	10	But put two scoundrels opposite him and get them to bring charges that he has cursed both God and the king . Then take him out and stone him to death. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	11	So the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth ’ s city did as Jezebel directed in the letters she had written to them .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	12	They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth in a prominent place among the people .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	13	Then two scoundrels came and sat opposite him and brought charges against Naboth before the people , saying , ‘ Naboth has cursed both God and the king. ’ So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	14	Then they sent word to Jezebel : ‘ Naboth has been stoned to death. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	15	As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death , she said to Ahab , ‘ Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite that he refused to sell you . He is no longer alive , but dead. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	16	When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , he got up and went down to take possession of Naboth ’ s vineyard .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	17	Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite :
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	18	‘ Go down to meet Ahab king of Israel , who rules in Samaria . He is now in Naboth ’ s vineyard , where he has gone to take possession of it .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	19	Say to him , “ This is what the Lord says : have you not murdered a man and seized his property ? ” Then say to him , “ This is what the Lord says : in the place where dogs licked up Naboth ’ s blood , dogs will lick up your blood – yes , yours ! ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	20	Ahab said to Elijah , ‘ So you have found me , my enemy ! ’ ‘ I have found you , ’ he answered , ‘ because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	22	I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and that of Baasha son of Ahijah , because you have aroused my anger and have caused Israel to sin. ”
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	23	‘ And also concerning Jezebel the Lord says : “ Dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of [ b ] Jezreel. ”
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	24	‘ Dogs will eat those belonging to Ahab who die in the city , and the birds will feed on those who die in the country. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	25	( There was never anyone like Ahab , who sold himself to do evil in the eyes of the Lord , urged on by Jezebel his wife .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	26	He behaved in the vilest manner by going after idols , like the Amorites the Lord drove out before Israel . )
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	27	When Ahab heard these words , he tore his clothes , put on sackcloth and fasted . He lay in sackcloth and went around meekly .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	28	Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite :
NIVUK	1%20Kings	21	29	‘ Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me ? Because he has humbled himself , I will not bring this disaster in his day , but I will bring it on his house in the days of his son. ’ Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	22	‘ “ By what means ? ” the Lord asked . ‘ “ I will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets , ” he said . ‘ “ You will succeed in enticing him , ” said the Lord . “ Go and do it. ”
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	2	But in the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to see the king of Israel .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	3	The king of Israel had said to his officials , ‘ Don ’ t you know that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us and yet we are doing nothing to retake it from the king of Aram ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	4	So he asked Jehoshaphat , ‘ Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth Gilead ? ’ Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel , ‘ I am as you are , my people as your people , my horses as your horses. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	5	But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel , ‘ First seek the counsel of the Lord. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	6	So the king of Israel brought together the prophets – about four hundred men – and asked them , ‘ Shall I go to war against Ramoth Gilead , or shall I refrain ? ’ ‘ Go , ’ they answered , ‘ for the Lord will give it into the king ’ s hand. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	7	But Jehoshaphat asked , ‘ Is there no longer a prophet of the Lord here whom we can enquire of ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	8	The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat , ‘ There is still one prophet through whom we can enquire of the Lord , but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me , but always bad . He is Micaiah son of Imlah. ’ ‘ The king should not say such a thing , ’ Jehoshaphat replied .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	9	So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said , ‘ Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	10	Dressed in their royal robes , the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing-floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria , with all the prophets prophesying before them .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	11	Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns and he declared , ‘ This is what the Lord says : “ With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	12	All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing . ‘ Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious , ’ they said , ‘ for the Lord will give it into the king ’ s hand. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	13	The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him , ‘ Look , the other prophets without exception are predicting success for the king . Let your word agree with theirs , and speak favourably. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	14	But Micaiah said , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , I can tell him only what the Lord tells me. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	15	When he arrived , the king asked him , ‘ Micaiah , shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead , or not ? ’ ‘ Attack and be victorious , ’ he answered , ‘ for the Lord will give it into the king ’ s hand. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	16	The king said to him , ‘ How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	17	Then Micaiah answered , ‘ I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd , and the Lord said , “ These people have no master . Let each one go home in peace. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	18	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , ‘ Didn ’ t I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me , but only bad ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	19	Micaiah continued , ‘ Therefore hear the word of the Lord : I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the multitudes of heaven standing round him on his right and on his left .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	20	And the Lord said , “ Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there ? ” ‘ One suggested this , and another that .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	21	Finally , a spirit came forward , stood before the Lord and said , “ I will entice him. ”
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	23	‘ So now the Lord has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours . The Lord has decreed disaster for you. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	24	Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face . ‘ Which way did the spirit from [ a ] the Lord go when he went from me to speak to you ? ’ he asked .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	25	Micaiah replied , ‘ You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	26	The king of Israel then ordered , ‘ Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king ’ s son
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	27	and say , “ This is what the king says : put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely. ” ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	28	Micaiah declared , ‘ If you ever return safely , the Lord has not spoken through me. ’ Then he added , ‘ Mark my words , all you people ! ’ Ahab killed at Ramoth Gilead
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	29	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	30	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , ‘ I will enter the battle in disguise , but you wear your royal robes. ’ So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	31	Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders , ‘ Do not fight with anyone , small or great , except the king of Israel. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	32	When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat , they thought , ‘ Surely this is the king of Israel. ’ So they turned to attack him , but when Jehoshaphat cried out ,
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	33	the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel and stopped pursuing him .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	34	But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armour . The king told his chariot driver , ‘ Wheel around and get me out of the fighting . I ’ ve been wounded. ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	35	All day long the battle raged , and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans . The blood from his wound ran onto the floor of the chariot , and that evening he died .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	36	As the sun was setting , a cry spread through the army : ‘ Every man to his town . Every man to his land ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	37	So the king died and was brought to Samaria , and they buried him there .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	38	They washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria ( where the prostitutes bathed ) , [ b ] and the dogs licked up his blood , as the word of the Lord had declared .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	39	As for the other events of Ahab ’ s reign , including all he did , the palace he built and adorned with ivory , and the cities he fortified , are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel ?
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	40	Ahab rested with his ancestors . And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king . Jehoshaphat king of Judah
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	41	Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	42	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem for twenty-five years . His mother ’ s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	43	In everything he followed the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them ; he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord . The high places , however , were not removed , and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there . [ c ]
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	44	Jehoshaphat was also at peace with the king of Israel .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	45	As for the other events of Jehoshaphat ’ s reign , the things he achieved and his military exploits , are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah ?
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	46	He rid the land of the rest of the male-shrine prostitutes who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	47	There was then no king in Edom ; a provincial governor ruled .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	48	Now Jehoshaphat built a fleet of trading ships [ d ] to go to Ophir for gold , but they never set sail – they were wrecked at Ezion Geber .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	49	At that time Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat , ‘ Let my men sail with yours , ’ but Jehoshaphat refused .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	50	Then Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of David his father . And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king . Ahaziah king of Israel
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	51	Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah , and he reigned over Israel for two years .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	52	He did evil in the eyes of the Lord , because he followed the ways of his father and mother and of Jeroboam son of Nebat , who caused Israel to sin .
NIVUK	1%20Kings	22	53	He served and worshipped Baal and aroused the anger of the Lord , the God of Israel , just as his father had done . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Kings	1	1	After Ahab ’ s death , Moab rebelled against Israel .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	1	3	But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite , ‘ Go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them , “ Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going off to consult Baal-Zebub , the god of Ekron ? ”
NIVUK	2%20Kings	1	4	Therefore this is what the Lord says : “ You will not leave the bed you are lying on . You will certainly die ! ” ’ So Elijah went .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	1	5	When the messengers returned to the king , he asked them , ‘ Why have you come back ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	1	6	‘ A man came to meet us , ’ they replied . ‘ And he said to us , “ Go back to the king who sent you and tell him , ‘ This is what the Lord says : is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending messengers to consult Baal-Zebub , the god of Ekron ? Therefore you will not leave the bed you are lying on . You will certainly die ! ’ ” ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	1	7	The king asked them , ‘ What kind of man was it who came to meet you and told you this ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	1	8	They replied , ‘ He had a garment of hair [ a ] and had a leather belt round his waist. ’ The king said , ‘ That was Elijah the Tishbite. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	1	9	Then he sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men . The captain went up to Elijah , who was sitting on the top of a hill , and said to him , ‘ Man of God , the king says , “ Come down ! ” ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	1	10	Elijah answered the captain , ‘ If I am a man of God , may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men ! ’ Then the fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	1	11	At this the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men . The captain said to him , ‘ Man of God , this is what the king says , “ Come down at once ! ” ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	1	12	‘ If I am a man of God , ’ Elijah replied , ‘ may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men ! ’ Then the fire of God fell from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	1	13	So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men . This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah . ‘ Man of God , ’ he begged , ‘ please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men , your servants !
NIVUK	2%20Kings	1	14	See , fire has fallen from heaven and consumed the first two captains and all their men . But now have respect for my life ! ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	1	15	The angel of the Lord said to Elijah , ‘ Go down with him ; do not be afraid of him. ’ So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	1	16	He told the king , ‘ This is what the Lord says : is it because there is no God in Israel for you to consult that you have sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub , the god of Ekron ? Because you have done this , you will never leave the bed you are lying on . You will certainly die ! ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	1	17	So he died , according to the word of the Lord that Elijah had spoken . Because Ahaziah had no son , Joram [ b ] succeeded him as king in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	1	18	As for all the other events of Ahaziah ’ s reign , and what he did , are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel ? Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	2	Elijah said to Elisha , ‘ Stay here ; the Lord has sent me to Bethel. ’ But Elisha said , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives and as you live , I will not leave you. ’ So they went down to Bethel .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	3	The company of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and asked , ‘ Do you know that the Lord is going to take your master from you today ? ’ ‘ Yes , I know , ’ Elisha replied , ‘ so be quiet. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	4	Then Elijah said to him , ‘ Stay here , Elisha ; the Lord has sent me to Jericho. ’ And he replied , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives and as you live , I will not leave you. ’ So they went to Jericho .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	5	The company of the prophets at Jericho went up to Elisha and asked him , ‘ Do you know that the Lord is going to take your master from you today ? ’ ‘ Yes , I know , ’ he replied , ‘ so be quiet. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	6	Then Elijah said to him , ‘ Stay here ; the Lord has sent me to the Jordan. ’ And he replied , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives and as you live , I will not leave you. ’ So the two of them walked on .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	7	Fifty men from the company of the prophets went and stood at a distance , facing the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped at the Jordan .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	8	Elijah took his cloak , rolled it up and struck the water with it . The water divided to the right and to the left , and the two of them crossed over on dry ground .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	9	When they had crossed , Elijah said to Elisha , ‘ Tell me , what can I do for you before I am taken from you ? ’ ‘ Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit , ’ Elisha replied .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	10	‘ You have asked a difficult thing , ’ Elijah said , ‘ yet if you see me when I am taken from you , it will be yours – otherwise , it will not. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	11	As they were walking along and talking together , suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them , and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	12	Elisha saw this and cried out , ‘ My father ! My father ! The chariots and horsemen of Israel ! ’ And Elisha saw him no more . Then he took hold of his garment and tore it in two .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	13	Elisha then picked up Elijah ’ s cloak that had fallen from him and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	14	He took the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and struck the water with it . ‘ Where now is the Lord , the God of Elijah ? ’ he asked . When he struck the water , it divided to the right and to the left , and he crossed over .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	15	The company of the prophets from Jericho , who were watching , said , ‘ The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha. ’ And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	16	‘ Look , ’ they said , ‘ we your servants have fifty able men . Let them go and look for your master . Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has picked him up and set him down on some mountain or in some valley. ’ ‘ No , ’ Elisha replied , ‘ do not send them. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	17	But they persisted until he was too embarrassed to refuse . So he said , ‘ Send them. ’ And they sent fifty men , who searched for three days but did not find him .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	18	When they returned to Elisha , who was staying in Jericho , he said to them , ‘ Didn ’ t I tell you not to go ? ’ Healing of the water
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	19	The people of the city said to Elisha , ‘ Look , our lord , this town is well situated , as you can see , but the water is bad and the land is unproductive. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	20	‘ Bring me a new bowl , ’ he said , ‘ and put salt in it. ’ So they brought it to him .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	21	Then he went out to the spring and threw the salt into it , saying , ‘ This is what the Lord says : “ I have healed this water . Never again will it cause death or make the land unproductive. ” ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	22	And the water has remained pure to this day , according to the word Elisha had spoken . Elisha is jeered
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	23	From there Elisha went up to Bethel . As he was walking along the road , some boys came out of the town and jeered at him . ‘ Get out of here , baldy ! ’ they said . ‘ Get out of here , baldy ! ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	2	24	He turned round , looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the Lord . Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys .

NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	3	Nevertheless he clung to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat , which he had caused Israel to commit ; he did not turn away from them .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	4	Now Mesha king of Moab raised sheep , and he had to pay the king of Israel a tribute of a hundred thousand lambs and the wool of a hundred thousand rams .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	5	But after Ahab died , the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	6	-
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	7	He also sent this message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah : ‘ The king of Moab has rebelled against me . Will you go with me to fight against Moab ? ’ ‘ I will go with you , ’ he replied . ‘ I am as you are , my people as your people , my horses as your horses. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	8	‘ By what route shall we attack ? ’ he asked . ‘ Through the Desert of Edom , ’ he answered .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	9	So the king of Israel set out with the king of Judah and the king of Edom . After a roundabout march of seven days , the army had no more water for themselves or for the animals with them .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	10	‘ What ! ’ exclaimed the king of Israel . ‘ Has the Lord called us three kings together only to deliver us into the hands of Moab ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	11	But Jehoshaphat asked , ‘ Is there no prophet of the Lord here , through whom we may enquire of the Lord ? ’ An officer of the king of Israel answered , ‘ Elisha son of Shaphat is here . He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	12	Jehoshaphat said , ‘ The word of the Lord is with him. ’ So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	13	Elisha said to the king of Israel , ‘ Why do you want to involve me ? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother. ’ ‘ No , ’ the king of Israel answered , ‘ because it was the Lord who called us three kings together to deliver us into the hands of Moab. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	14	Elisha said , ‘ As surely as the Lord Almighty lives , whom I serve , if I did not have respect for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah , I would not pay any attention to you .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	15	But now bring me a harpist. ’ While the harpist was playing , the hand of the Lord came on Elisha
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	16	and he said , ‘ This is what the Lord says : I will fill this valley with pools of water .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	17	For this is what the Lord says : you will see neither wind nor rain , yet this valley will be filled with water , and you , your cattle and your other animals will drink .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	18	This is an easy thing in the eyes of the Lord ; he will also deliver Moab into your hands .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	19	You will overthrow every fortified city and every major town . You will cut down every good tree , block up all the springs , and ruin every good field with stones. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	20	The next morning , about the time for offering the sacrifice , there it was – water flowing from the direction of Edom ! And the land was filled with water .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	21	Now all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come to fight against them ; so every man , young and old , who could bear arms was called up and stationed on the border .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	22	When they got up early in the morning , the sun was shining on the water . To the Moabites across the way , the water looked red – like blood .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	23	‘ That ’ s blood ! ’ they said . ‘ Those kings must have fought and slaughtered each other . Now to the plunder , Moab ! ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	24	But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel , the Israelites rose up and fought them until they fled . And the Israelites invaded the land and slaughtered the Moabites .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	25	They destroyed the towns , and each man threw a stone on every good field until it was covered . They stopped up all the springs and cut down every good tree . Only Kir Hareseth was left with its stones in place , but men armed with slings surrounded it and attacked it .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	26	When the king of Moab saw that the battle had gone against him , he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom , but they failed .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	3	27	Then he took his firstborn son , who was to succeed him as king , and offered him as a sacrifice on the city wall . The fury against Israel was great ; they withdrew and returned to their own land . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	2	Elisha replied to her , ‘ How can I help you ? Tell me , what do you have in your house ? ’ ‘ Your servant has nothing there at all , ’ she said , ‘ except a small jar of olive oil. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	4	Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons . Pour oil into all the jars , and as each is filled , put it to one side. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	3	Elisha said , ‘ Go round and ask all your neighbours for empty jars . Don ’ t ask for just a few .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	5	She left him and shut the door behind her and her sons . They brought the jars to her and she kept pouring .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	6	When all the jars were full , she said to her son , ‘ Bring me another one. ’ But he replied , ‘ There is not a jar left. ’ Then the oil stopped flowing .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	7	She went and told the man of God , and he said , ‘ Go , sell the oil and pay your debts . You and your sons can live on what is left. ’ The Shunammite ’ s son restored to life
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	8	One day Elisha went to Shunem . And a well-to-do woman was there , who urged him to stay for a meal . So whenever he passed by , he stopped there to eat .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	9	She said to her husband , ‘ I know that this man who often comes our way is a holy man of God .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	10	Let ’ s make a small room on the roof and put in it a bed and a table , a chair and a lamp for him . Then he can stay there whenever he comes to us. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	11	One day when Elisha came , he went up to his room and lay down there .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	12	He said to his servant Gehazi , ‘ Call the Shunammite. ’ So he called her , and she stood before him .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	13	Elisha said to him , ‘ Tell her , “ You have gone to all this trouble for us . Now what can be done for you ? Can we speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army ? ” ’ She replied , ‘ I have a home among my own people. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	14	‘ What can be done for her ? ’ Elisha asked . Gehazi said , ‘ She has no son , and her husband is old. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	15	Then Elisha said , ‘ Call her. ’ So he called her , and she stood in the doorway .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	16	‘ About this time next year , ’ Elisha said , ‘ you will hold a son in your arms. ’ ‘ No , my lord ! ’ she objected . ‘ Please , man of God , don ’ t mislead your servant ! ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	17	But the woman became pregnant , and the next year about that same time she gave birth to a son , just as Elisha had told her .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	18	The child grew , and one day he went out to his father , who was with the reapers .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	19	He said to his father , ‘ My head ! My head ! ’ His father told a servant , ‘ Carry him to his mother. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	20	After the servant had lifted him up and carried him to his mother , the boy sat on her lap until noon , and then he died .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	21	She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God , then shut the door and went out .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	22	She called her husband and said , ‘ Please send me one of the servants and a donkey so I can go to the man of God quickly and return. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	23	‘ Why go to him today ? ’ he asked . ‘ It ’ s not the New Moon or the Sabbath. ’ ‘ That ’ s all right , ’ she said .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	24	She saddled the donkey and said to her servant , ‘ Lead on ; don ’ t slow down for me unless I tell you. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	25	So she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel . When he saw her in the distance , the man of God said to his servant Gehazi , ‘ Look ! There ’ s the Shunammite !
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	26	Run to meet her and ask her , “ Are you all right ? Is your husband all right ? Is your child all right ? ” ’ ‘ Everything is all right , ’ she said .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	27	When she reached the man of God at the mountain , she took hold of his feet . Gehazi came over to push her away , but the man of God said , ‘ Leave her alone ! She is in bitter distress , but the Lord has hidden it from me and has not told me why. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	28	‘ Did I ask you for a son , my lord ? ’ she said . ‘ Didn ’ t I tell you , “ Don ’ t raise my hopes ” ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	29	Elisha said to Gehazi , ‘ Tuck your cloak into your belt , take my staff in your hand and run . Don ’ t greet anyone you meet , and if anyone greets you , do not answer . Lay my staff on the boy ’ s face. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	30	But the child ’ s mother said , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives and as you live , I will not leave you. ’ So he got up and followed her .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	31	Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the boy ’ s face , but there was no sound or response . So Gehazi went back to meet Elisha and told him , ‘ The boy has not awakened. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	32	When Elisha reached the house , there was the boy lying dead on his couch .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	33	He went in , shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	34	Then he got on the bed and lay on the boy , mouth to mouth , eyes to eyes , hands to hands . As he stretched himself out on him , the boy ’ s body grew warm .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	4	35	Elisha turned away and walked back and forth in the room and then got onto the bed and stretched out on him once more . The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes .

NIVUK	2%20Kings	5	5	‘ By all means , go , ’ the king of Aram replied . ‘ I will send a letter to the king of Israel. ’ So Naaman left , taking with him ten talents [ b ] of silver , six thousand shekels [ c ] of gold and ten sets of clothing .

NIVUK	2%20Kings	5	8	When Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his robes , he sent him this message : ‘ Why have you torn your robes ? Make the man come to me and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	5	9	So Naaman went with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of Elisha ’ s house .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	5	10	Elisha sent a messenger to say to him , ‘ Go , wash yourself seven times in the Jordan , and your flesh will be restored and you will be cleansed. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	5	11	and
NIVUK	2%20Kings	5	12	Are not Abana and Pharpar , the rivers of Damascus , better than all the waters of Israel ? Couldn ’ t I wash in them and be cleansed ? ’ So he turned and went off in a rage .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	5	13	Naaman ’ s servants went to him and said , ‘ My father , if the prophet had told you to do some great thing , would you not have done it ? How much more , then , when he tells you , “ Wash and be cleansed ” ! ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	5	14	So he went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times , as the man of God had told him , and his flesh was restored and became clean like that of a young boy .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	5	15	Then Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God . He stood before him and said , ‘ Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel . So please accept a gift from your servant. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	5	16	The prophet answered , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , whom I serve , I will not accept a thing. ’ And even though Naaman urged him , he refused .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	5	17	‘ If you will not , ’ said Naaman , ‘ please let me , your servant , be given as much earth as a pair of mules can carry , for your servant will never again make burnt offerings and sacrifices to any other god but the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	5	18	But may the Lord forgive your servant for this one thing : when my master enters the temple of Rimmon to bow down and he is leaning on my arm and I have to bow there also – when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon , may the Lord forgive your servant for this. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	5	19	‘ Go in peace , ’ Elisha said . After Naaman had travelled some distance ,
NIVUK	2%20Kings	5	20	Gehazi , the servant of Elisha the man of God , said to himself , ‘ My master was too easy on Naaman , this Aramean , by not accepting from him what he brought . As surely as the Lord lives , I will run after him and get something from him. ’

NIVUK	2%20Kings	5	22	‘ Everything is all right , ’ Gehazi answered . ‘ My master sent me to say , “ Two young men from the company of the prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim . Please give them a talent [ d ] of silver and two sets of clothing. ” ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	5	23	‘ By all means , take two talents , ’ said Naaman . He urged Gehazi to accept them , and then tied up the two talents of silver in two bags , with two sets of clothing . He gave them to two of his servants , and they carried them ahead of Gehazi .

NIVUK	2%20Kings	5	25	When he went in and stood before his master , Elisha asked him , ‘ Where have you been , Gehazi ? ’ ‘ Your servant didn ’ t go anywhere , ’ Gehazi answered .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	5	26	But Elisha said to him , ‘ Was not my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you ? Is this the time to take money or to accept clothes – or olive groves and vineyards , or flocks and herds , or male and female slaves ?

NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	6	The man of God asked , ‘ Where did it fall ? ’ When he showed him the place , Elisha cut a stick and threw it there , and made the iron float .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	3	Then one of them said , ‘ Won ’ t you please come with your servants ? ’ ‘ I will , ’ Elisha replied .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	4	And he went with them . They went to the Jordan and began to cut down trees .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	5	As one of them was cutting down a tree , the iron axe-head fell into the water . ‘ Oh no , my lord ! ’ he cried out . ‘ It was borrowed ! ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	7	‘ Lift it out , ’ he said . Then the man reached out his hand and took it . Elisha traps blinded Arameans
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	8	Now the king of Aram was at war with Israel . After conferring with his officers , he said , ‘ I will set up my camp in such and such a place. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	9	The man of God sent word to the king of Israel : ‘ Beware of passing that place , because the Arameans are going down there. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	10	So the king of Israel checked on the place indicated by the man of God . Time and again Elisha warned the king , so that he was on his guard in such places .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	11	This enraged the king of Aram . He summoned his officers and demanded of them , ‘ Tell me ! Which of us is on the side of the king of Israel ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	12	‘ None of us , my lord the king , ’ said one of his officers , ‘ but Elisha , the prophet who is in Israel , tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	13	‘ Go , find out where he is , ’ the king ordered , ‘ so that I can send men and capture him. ’ The report came back : ‘ He is in Dothan. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	14	Then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there . They went by night and surrounded the city .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	15	When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning , an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city . ‘ Oh no , my lord ! What shall we do ? ’ the servant asked .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	16	‘ Don ’ t be afraid , ’ the prophet answered . ‘ Those who are with us are more than those who are with them. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	17	And Elisha prayed , ‘ Open his eyes , Lord , so that he may see. ’ Then the Lord opened the servant ’ s eyes , and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all round Elisha .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	18	As the enemy came down towards him , Elisha prayed to the Lord , ‘ Strike this army with blindness. ’ So he struck them with blindness , as Elisha had asked .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	19	Elisha told them , ‘ This is not the road and this is not the city . Follow me , and I will lead you to the man you are looking for. ’ And he led them to Samaria .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	20	After they entered the city , Elisha said , ‘ Lord , open the eyes of these men so that they can see. ’ Then the Lord opened their eyes and they looked , and there they were , inside Samaria .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	21	When the king of Israel saw them , he asked Elisha , ‘ Shall I kill them , my father ? Shall I kill them ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	22	‘ Do not kill them , ’ he answered . ‘ Would you kill those you have captured with your own sword or bow ? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink and then go back to their master. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	23	So he prepared a great feast for them , and after they had finished eating and drinking , he sent them away , and they returned to their master . So the bands from Aram stopped raiding Israel ’ s territory . Famine in besieged Samaria
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	24	Some time later , Ben-Hadad king of Aram mobilised his entire army and marched up and laid siege to Samaria .

NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	26	As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall , a woman cried to him , ‘ Help me , my lord the king ! ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	27	The king replied , ‘ If the Lord does not help you , where can I get help for you ? From the threshing floor ? From the winepress ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	28	Then he asked her , ‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ She answered , ‘ This woman said to me , “ Give up your son so that we may eat him today , and tomorrow we ’ ll eat my son. ”
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	29	So we cooked my son and ate him . The next day I said to her , “ Give up your son so that we may eat him , ” but she had hidden him. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	30	When the king heard the woman ’ s words , he tore his robes . As he went along the wall , the people looked , and they saw that , under his robes , he had sackcloth on his body .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	31	He said , ‘ May God deal with me , be it ever so severely , if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today ! ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	32	Now Elisha was sitting in his house , and the elders were sitting with him . The king sent a messenger ahead , but before he arrived , Elisha said to the elders , ‘ Don ’ t you see how this murderer is sending someone to cut off my head ? Look , when the messenger comes , shut the door and hold it shut against him . Is not the sound of his master ’ s footsteps behind him ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	6	33	While he was still talking to them , the messenger came down to him . The king said , ‘ This disaster is from the Lord . Why should I wait for the Lord any longer ? ’ Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Kings	8	4	The king was talking to Gehazi , the servant of the man of God , and had said , ‘ Tell me about all the great things Elisha has done. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	8	5	Just as Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life , the woman whose son Elisha had brought back to life came to appeal to the king for her house and land . Gehazi said , ‘ This is the woman , my lord the king , and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	8	6	The king asked the woman about it , and she told him . Then he assigned an official to her case and said to him , ‘ Give back everything that belonged to her , including all the income from her land from the day she left the country until now. ’ Hazael murders Ben-Hadad

NIVUK	2%20Kings	8	12	‘ Why is my lord weeping ? ’ asked Hazael . ‘ Because I know the harm you will do to the Israelites , ’ he answered . ‘ You will set fire to their fortified places , kill their young men with the sword , dash their little children to the ground , and rip open their pregnant women. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	8	13	Hazael said , ‘ How could your servant , a mere dog , accomplish such a feat ? ’ ‘ The Lord has shown me that you will become king of Aram , ’ answered Elisha .

NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	5	When he arrived , he found the army officers sitting together . ‘ I have a message for you , commander , ’ he said . ‘ For which of us ? ’ asked Jehu . ‘ For you , commander , ’ he replied .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	6	Jehu got up and went into the house . Then the prophet poured the oil on Jehu ’ s head and declared , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : “ I anoint you king over the Lord ’ s people Israel .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	7	You are to destroy the house of Ahab your master , and I will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the Lord ’ s servants shed by Jezebel .

NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	14	So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat , the son of Nimshi , conspired against Joram . ( Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth Gilead against Hazael king of Aram ,
NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	15	but King Joram [ b ] had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him in the battle with Hazael king of Aram . ) Jehu said , ‘ If you desire to make me king , don ’ t let anyone slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	16	Then he got into his chariot and rode to Jezreel , because Joram was resting there and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	17	and 21-24 -
NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	18	The horseman rode off to meet Jehu and said , ‘ This is what the king says : “ Do you come in peace ? ” ’ ‘ What do you have to do with peace ? ’ Jehu replied . ‘ Fall in behind me. ’ The lookout reported , ‘ The messenger has reached them , but he isn ’ t coming back. ’

NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	20	The lookout reported , ‘ He has reached them , but he isn ’ t coming back either . The driving is like that of Jehu son of Nimshi – he drives like a maniac. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	21	‘ Hitch up my chariot , ’ Joram ordered . And when it was hitched up , Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah rode out , each in his own chariot , to meet Jehu . They met him at the plot of ground that had belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	22	When Joram saw Jehu he asked , ‘ Have you come in peace , Jehu ? ’ ‘ How can there be peace , ’ Jehu replied , ‘ as long as all the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	23	Joram turned about and fled , calling out to Ahaziah , ‘ Treachery , Ahaziah ! ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	24	Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders . The arrow pierced his heart and he slumped down in his chariot .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	25	Jehu said to Bidkar , his chariot officer , ‘ Pick him up and throw him on the field that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite . Remember how you and I were riding together in chariots behind Ahab his father when the Lord spoke this prophecy against him :
NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	26	“ Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons , declares the Lord , and I will surely make you pay for it on this plot of ground , declares the Lord. ” [ c ] Now then , pick him up and throw him on that plot , in accordance with the word of the Lord. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	27	When Ahaziah king of Judah saw what had happened , he fled up the road to Beth Haggan . [ d ] Jehu chased him , shouting , ‘ Kill him too ! ’ They wounded him in his chariot on the way up to Gur near Ibleam , but he escaped to Megiddo and died there .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	28	His servants took him by chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his ancestors in his tomb in the City of David .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	29	( In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab , Ahaziah had become king of Judah . ) Jezebel killed
NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	30	Then Jehu went to Jezreel . When Jezebel heard about it , she put on eye makeup , arranged her hair and looked out of a window .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	9	31	As Jehu entered the gate , she asked , ‘ Have you come in peace , you Zimri , you murderer of your master ? ’ [ e ]

NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	10	Know , then , that not a word the Lord has spoken against the house of Ahab will fail . The Lord has done what he announced through his servant Elijah. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	3	choose the best and most worthy of your master ’ s sons and set him on his father ’ s throne . Then fight for your master ’ s house. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	4	But they were terrified and said , ‘ If two kings could not resist him , how can we ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	5	So the palace administrator , the city governor , the elders and the guardians sent this message to Jehu : ‘ We are your servants and we will do anything you say . We will not appoint anyone as king ; you do whatever you think best. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	6	Then Jehu wrote them a second letter , saying , ‘ If you are on my side and will obey me , take the heads of your master ’ s sons and come to me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow. ’ Now the royal princes , seventy of them , were with the leading men of the city , who were bringing them up .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	7	When the letter arrived , these men took the princes and slaughtered all seventy of them . They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	8	When the messenger arrived , he told Jehu , ‘ They have brought the heads of the princes. ’ Then Jehu ordered , ‘ Put them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	9	The next morning Jehu went out . He stood before all the people and said , ‘ You are innocent . It was I who conspired against my master and killed him , but who killed all these ?
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	11	So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab , as well as all his chief men , his close friends and his priests , leaving him no survivor .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	12	Jehu then set out and went towards Samaria . At Beth Eked of the Shepherds ,
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	13	he met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked , ‘ Who are you ? ’ They said , ‘ We are relatives of Ahaziah , and we have come down to greet the families of the king and of the queen mother. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	14	‘ Take them alive ! ’ he ordered . So they took them alive and slaughtered them by the well of Beth Eked – forty-two of them . He left no survivor .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	15	After he left there , he came upon Jehonadab son of Rekab , who was on his way to meet him . Jehu greeted him and said , ‘ Are you in accord with me , as I am with you ? ’ ‘ I am , ’ Jehonadab answered . ‘ If so , ’ said Jehu , ‘ give me your hand. ’ So he did , and Jehu helped him up into the chariot .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	16	Jehu said , ‘ Come with me and see my zeal for the Lord. ’ Then he made him ride in his chariot .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	17	When Jehu came to Samaria , he killed all who were left there of Ahab ’ s family ; he destroyed them , according to the word of the Lord spoken to Elijah . Servants of Baal killed

NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	19	Now summon all the prophets of Baal , all his servants and all his priests . See that no one is missing , because I am going to hold a great sacrifice for Baal . Anyone who fails to come will no longer live. ’ But Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the servants of Baal .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	20	Jehu said , ‘ Call an assembly in honour of Baal. ’ So they proclaimed it .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	21	Then he sent word throughout Israel , and all the servants of Baal came ; not one stayed away . They crowded into the temple of Baal until it was full from one end to the other .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	22	And Jehu said to the keeper of the wardrobe , ‘ Bring robes for all the servants of Baal. ’ So he brought out robes for them .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	23	Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rekab went into the temple of Baal . Jehu said to the servants of Baal , ‘ Look around and see that no one who serves the Lord is here with you – only servants of Baal. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	24	So they went in to make sacrifices and burnt offerings . Now Jehu had posted eighty men outside with this warning : ‘ If one of you lets any of the men I am placing in your hands escape , it will be your life for his life. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	25	As soon as Jehu had finished making the burnt offering , he ordered the guards and officers : ‘ Go in and kill them ; let no one escape. ’ So they cut them down with the sword . The guards and officers threw the bodies out and then entered the inner shrine of the temple of Baal .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	26	They brought the sacred stone out of the temple of Baal and burned it .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	10	27	They demolished the sacred stone of Baal and tore down the temple of Baal , and people have used it for a latrine to this day .

NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	3	Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up to attack Hoshea , who had been Shalmaneser ’ s vassal and had paid him tribute .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	4	But the king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea was a traitor , for he had sent envoys to So [ a ] king of Egypt , and he no longer paid tribute to the king of Assyria , as he had done year by year . Therefore Shalmaneser seized him and put him in prison .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	5	The king of Assyria invaded the entire land , marched against Samaria and laid siege to it for three years .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	6	In the ninth year of Hoshea , the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria . He settled them in Halah , in Gozan on the River Habor and in the towns of the Medes . Israel exiled because of sin
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	7	All this took place because the Israelites had sinned against the Lord their God , who had brought them up out of Egypt from under the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt . They worshipped other gods
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	8	and followed the practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before them , as well as the practices that the kings of Israel had introduced .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	9	The Israelites secretly did things against the Lord their God that were not right . From watch-tower to fortified city they built themselves high places in all their towns .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	10	They set up sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	11	At every high place they burned incense , as the nations whom the Lord had driven out before them had done . They did wicked things that aroused the Lord ’ s anger .

NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	13	The Lord warned Israel and Judah through all his prophets and seers : ‘ Turn from your evil ways . Observe my commands and decrees , in accordance with the entire Law that I commanded your ancestors to obey and that I delivered to you through my servants the prophets. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	14	But they would not listen and were as stiff-necked as their ancestors , who did not trust in the Lord their God .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	15	They rejected his decrees and the covenant he had made with their ancestors and the statutes he had warned them to keep . They followed worthless idols and themselves became worthless . They imitated the nations around them although the Lord had ordered them , ‘ Do not do as they do. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	16	They forsook all the commands of the Lord their God and made for themselves two idols cast in the shape of calves , and an Asherah pole . They bowed down to all the starry hosts , and they worshipped Baal .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	18	So the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them from his presence . Only the tribe of Judah was left ,
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	19	and even Judah did not keep the commands of the Lord their God . They followed the practices Israel had introduced .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	20	Therefore the Lord rejected all the people of Israel ; he afflicted them and gave them into the hands of plunderers , until he thrust them from his presence .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	21	When he tore Israel away from the house of David , they made Jeroboam son of Nebat their king . Jeroboam enticed Israel away from following the Lord and caused them to commit a great sin .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	22	The Israelites persisted in all the sins of Jeroboam and did not turn away from them

NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	24	The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon , Kuthah , Avva , Hamath and Sepharvaim and settled them in the towns of Samaria to replace the Israelites . They took over Samaria and lived in its towns .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	25	When they first lived there , they did not worship the Lord ; so he sent lions among them and they killed some of the people .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	26	It was reported to the king of Assyria : ‘ The people you deported and resettled in the towns of Samaria do not know what the god of that country requires . He has sent lions among them , which are killing them off , because the people do not know what he requires. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	27	Then the king of Assyria gave this order : ‘ Make one of the priests you took captive from Samaria go back to live there and teach the people what the god of the land requires. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	28	So one of the priests who had been exiled from Samaria came to live in Bethel and taught them how to worship the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	29	Nevertheless , each national group made its own gods in the several towns where they settled , and set them up in the shrines the people of Samaria had made at the high places .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	30	The people from Babylon made Sukkoth Benoth , those from Kuthah made Nergal , and those from Hamath made Ashima ;
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	31	the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak , and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire as sacrifices to Adrammelek and Anammelek , the gods of Sepharvaim .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	32	They worshipped the Lord , but they also appointed all sorts of their own people to officiate for them as priests in the shrines at the high places .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	33	They worshipped the Lord , but they also served their own gods in accordance with the customs of the nations from which they had been brought .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	34	To this day they persist in their former practices . They neither worship the Lord nor adhere to the decrees and regulations , the laws and commands that the Lord gave the descendants of Jacob , whom he named Israel .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	35	When the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites , he commanded them : ‘ Do not worship any other gods or bow down to them , serve them or sacrifice to them .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	36	But the Lord , who brought you up out of Egypt with mighty power and outstretched arm , is the one you must worship . To him you shall bow down and to him offer sacrifices .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	37	You must always be careful to keep the decrees and regulations , the laws and commands he wrote for you . Do not worship other gods .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	38	Do not forget the covenant I have made with you , and do not worship other gods .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	39	Rather , worship the Lord your God ; it is he who will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	40	They would not listen , however , but persisted in their former practices .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	17	41	Even while these people were worshipping the Lord , they were serving their idols . To this day their children and grandchildren continue to do as their ancestors did . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Kings	18	5	Hezekiah trusted in the Lord , the God of Israel . There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah , either before him or after him .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	18	6	He held fast to the Lord and did not stop following him ; he kept the commands the Lord had given Moses .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	18	7	And the Lord was with him ; he was successful in whatever he undertook . He rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him .

NIVUK	2%20Kings	18	14	So Hezekiah king of Judah sent this message to the king of Assyria at Lachish : ‘ I have done wrong . Withdraw from me , and I will pay whatever you demand of me. ’ The king of Assyria exacted from Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents [ c ] of silver and thirty talents [ d ] of gold .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	18	15	So Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the temple of the Lord and in the treasuries of the royal palace .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	18	16	At this time Hezekiah king of Judah stripped off the gold with which he had covered the doors and doorposts of the temple of the Lord , and gave it to the king of Assyria . Sennacherib threatens Jerusalem

NIVUK	2%20Kings	18	20	You say you have the counsel and the might for war – but you speak only empty words . On whom are you depending , that you rebel against me ?
NIVUK	2%20Kings	18	21	Look , I know you are depending on Egypt , that splintered reed of a staff , which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it ! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	18	22	But if you say to me , ‘ We are depending on the Lord our God ’ – isn ’ t he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed , saying to Judah and Jerusalem , ‘ You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem ’ ?
NIVUK	2%20Kings	18	23	‘ “ Come now , make a bargain with my master , the king of Assyria : I will give you two thousand horses – if you can put riders on them !

NIVUK	2%20Kings	18	25	Furthermore , have I come to attack and destroy this place without word from the Lord ? The Lord himself told me to march against this country and destroy it. ” ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	18	26	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah , and Shebna and Joah said to the field commander , ‘ Please speak to your servants in Aramaic , since we understand it . Don ’ t speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	18	27	But the commander replied , ‘ Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things , and not to the people sitting on the wall – who , like you , will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine ? ’

NIVUK	2%20Kings	19	3	They told him , ‘ This is what Hezekiah says : this day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace , as when children come to the moment of birth and there is no strength to deliver them .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	19	4	It may be that the Lord your God will hear all the words of the field commander , whom his master , the king of Assyria , has sent to ridicule the living God , and that he will rebuke him for the words the Lord your God has heard . Therefore pray for the remnant that still survives. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	19	5	When King Hezekiah ’ s officials came to Isaiah ,
NIVUK	2%20Kings	19	6	Isaiah said to them , ‘ Tell your master , “ This is what the Lord says : do not be afraid of what you have heard – those words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me .

NIVUK	2%20Kings	19	9	Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah , the king of Cush , [ a ] was marching out to fight against him . So he again sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word :
NIVUK	2%20Kings	19	10	‘ Say to Hezekiah king of Judah : do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says , “ Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria. ”
NIVUK	2%20Kings	19	11	Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries , destroying them completely . And will you be delivered ?

NIVUK	2%20Kings	19	15	And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord : ‘ Lord , the God of Israel , enthroned between the cherubim , you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth . You have made heaven and earth .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	19	16	Give ear , Lord , and hear ; open your eyes , Lord , and see ; listen to the words Sennacherib has sent to ridicule the living God .

NIVUK	2%20Kings	20	3	‘ Remember , Lord , how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes. ’ And Hezekiah wept bitterly .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	20	4	Before Isaiah had left the middle court , the word of the Lord came to him :
NIVUK	2%20Kings	20	5	‘ Go back and tell Hezekiah , the ruler of my people , “ This is what the Lord , the God of your father David , says : I have heard your prayer and seen your tears ; I will heal you . On the third day from now you will go up to the temple of the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	20	6	I will add fifteen years to your life . And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria . I will defend this city for my sake and for the sake of my servant David. ” ’

NIVUK	2%20Kings	20	8	Hezekiah had asked Isaiah , ‘ What will be the sign that the Lord will heal me and that I will go up to the temple of the Lord on the third day from now ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	20	9	Isaiah answered , ‘ This is the Lord ’ s sign to you that the Lord will do what he has promised : shall the shadow go forward ten steps , or shall it go back ten steps ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	20	10	‘ It is a simple matter for the shadow to go forward ten steps , ’ said Hezekiah . ‘ Rather , let it go back ten steps. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	20	11	Then the prophet Isaiah called on the Lord , and the Lord made the shadow go back the ten steps it had gone down on the stairway of Ahaz . Envoys from Babylon
NIVUK	2%20Kings	20	12	At that time Marduk-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah letters and a gift , because he had heard of Hezekiah ’ s illness .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	20	13	Hezekiah received the envoys and showed them all that was in his storehouses – the silver , the gold , the spices and the fine oil – his armoury and everything found among his treasures . There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	20	14	Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked , ‘ What did those men say , and where did they come from ? ’ ‘ From a distant land , ’ Hezekiah replied . ‘ They came from Babylon. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	20	15	The prophet asked , ‘ What did they see in your palace ? ’ ‘ They saw everything in my palace , ’ Hezekiah said . ‘ There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	20	16	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah , ‘ Hear the word of the Lord :

NIVUK	2%20Kings	21	21	He followed completely the ways of his father , worshipped the idols his father had worshipped , and bowing down to them .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	21	3	He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had destroyed ; he also erected altars to Baal and made an Asherah pole , as Ahab king of Israel had done . He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshipped them .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	21	4	He built altars in the temple of the Lord , of which the Lord had said , ‘ In Jerusalem I will put my Name. ’

NIVUK	2%20Kings	21	6	He sacrificed his own son in the fire , practised divination , sought omens , and consulted mediums and spiritists . He did much evil in the eyes of the Lord , arousing his anger .

NIVUK	2%20Kings	21	9	But the people did not listen . Manasseh led them astray , so that they did more evil than the nations the Lord had destroyed before the Israelites .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	21	10	The Lord said through his servants the prophets :
NIVUK	2%20Kings	21	11	‘ Manasseh king of Judah has committed these detestable sins . He has done more evil than the Amorites who preceded him and has led Judah into sin with his idols .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	21	12	Therefore this is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : I am going to bring such disaster on Jerusalem and Judah that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	21	13	I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria and the plumb-line used against the house of Ahab . I will wipe out Jerusalem as one wipes out a dish , wiping it and turning it upside-down .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	21	14	I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance and give them into the hands of enemies . They will be looted and plundered by all their enemies ;
NIVUK	2%20Kings	21	15	they have done evil in my eyes and have aroused my anger from the day their ancestors came out of Egypt until this day. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	21	16	Moreover , Manasseh also shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from end to end – besides the sin that he had caused Judah to commit , so that they did evil in the eyes of the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	21	17	As for the other events of Manasseh ’ s reign , and all he did , including the sin he committed , are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah ?

NIVUK	2%20Kings	22	3	In the eighteenth year of his reign , King Josiah sent the secretary , Shaphan son of Azaliah , the son of Meshullam , to the temple of the Lord . He said :
NIVUK	2%20Kings	22	4	‘ Go up to Hilkiah the high priest and make him get ready the money that has been brought into the temple of the Lord , which the doorkeepers have collected from the people .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	22	5	Make them entrust it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the temple . And make these men pay the workers who repair the temple of the Lord –
NIVUK	2%20Kings	22	6	the carpenters , the builders and the masons . Also make them purchase timber and dressed stone to repair the temple .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	22	7	But they need not account for the money entrusted to them , because they are honest in their dealings. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	22	8	Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary , ‘ I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the Lord. ’ He gave it to Shaphan , who read it .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	22	9	Then Shaphan the secretary went to the king and reported to him : ‘ Your officials have paid out the money that was in the temple of the Lord and have entrusted it to the workers and supervisors at the temple. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	22	10	Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king , ‘ Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. ’ And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	22	11	When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law , he tore his robes .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	22	12	He gave these orders to Hilkiah the priest , Ahikam son of Shaphan , Akbor son of Micaiah , Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the king ’ s attendant :
NIVUK	2%20Kings	22	13	‘ Go and enquire of the Lord for me and for the people and for all Judah about what is written in this book that has been found . Great is the Lord ’ s anger that burns against us because those who have gone before us have not obeyed the words of this book ; they have not acted in accordance with all that is written there concerning us. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	22	14	Hilkiah the priest , Ahikam , Akbor , Shaphan and Asaiah went to speak to the prophet Huldah , who was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah , the son of Harhas , keeper of the wardrobe . She lived in Jerusalem , in the New Quarter .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	22	15	She said to them , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : tell the man who sent you to me ,
NIVUK	2%20Kings	22	16	“ This is what the Lord says : I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people , according to everything written in the book the king of Judah has read .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	22	17	Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and aroused my anger by all the idols their hands have made , [ a ] my anger will burn against this place and will not be quenched. ”
NIVUK	2%20Kings	22	18	Tell the king of Judah , who sent you to enquire of the Lord , “ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says concerning the words you heard :
NIVUK	2%20Kings	22	19	because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard what I have spoken against this place and its people – that they would become a curse [ b ] and be laid waste – and because you tore your robes and wept in my presence , I also have heard you , declares the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	22	20	Therefore I will gather you to your ancestors , and you will be buried in peace . Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place. ” ’ So they took her answer back to the king . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	23	But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah , this Passover was celebrated to the Lord in Jerusalem .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	3	The king stood by the pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the Lord – to follow the Lord and keep his commands , statutes and decrees with all his heart and all his soul , thus confirming the words of the covenant written in this book . Then all the people pledged themselves to the covenant .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	4	The king ordered Hilkiah the high priest , the priests next in rank and the doorkeepers to remove from the temple of the Lord all the articles made for Baal and Asherah and all the starry hosts . He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron Valley and took the ashes to Bethel .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	5	He did away with the idolatrous priests appointed by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places of the towns of Judah and on those around Jerusalem – those who burned incense to Baal , to the sun and moon , to the constellations and to all the starry hosts .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	6	He took the Asherah pole from the temple of the Lord to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem and burned it there . He ground it to powder and scattered the dust over the graves of the common people .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	7	He also tore down the quarters of the male shrine-prostitutes that were in the temple of the Lord , the quarters where women did weaving for Asherah .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	8	Josiah brought all the priests from the towns of Judah and desecrated the high places , from Geba to Beersheba , where the priests had burned incense . He broke down the gateway at the entrance of the Gate of Joshua , the city governor , which was on the left of the city gate .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	9	Although the priests of the high places did not serve at the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem , they ate unleavened bread with their fellow priests .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	10	He desecrated Topheth , which was in the Valley of Ben Hinnom , so no one could use it to sacrifice their son or daughter in the fire to Molek .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	11	He removed from the entrance to the temple of the Lord the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun . They were in the court [ a ] near the room of an official named Nathan-Melek . Josiah then burned the chariots dedicated to the sun .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	12	He pulled down the altars the kings of Judah had erected on the roof near the upper room of Ahaz , and the altars Manasseh had built in the two courts of the temple of the Lord . He removed them from there , smashed them to pieces and threw the rubble into the Kidron Valley .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	13	The king also desecrated the high places that were east of Jerusalem on the south of the Hill of Corruption – the ones Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the vile goddess of the Sidonians , for Chemosh the vile god of Moab , and for Molek the detestable god of the people of Ammon .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	14	Josiah smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles and covered the sites with human bones .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	15	Even the altar at Bethel , the high place made by Jeroboam son of Nebat , who had caused Israel to sin – even that altar and high place he demolished . He burned the high place and ground it to powder , and burned the Asherah pole also .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	16	Then Josiah looked around , and when he saw the tombs that were there on the hillside , he had the bones removed from them and burned on the altar to defile it , in accordance with the word of the Lord proclaimed by the man of God who foretold these things .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	17	The king asked , ‘ What is that tombstone I see ? ’ The people of the city said , ‘ It marks the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and pronounced against the altar of Bethel the very things you have done to it. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	18	‘ Leave it alone , ’ he said . ‘ Don ’ t let anyone disturb his bones. ’ So they spared his bones and those of the prophet who had come from Samaria .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	19	Just as he had done at Bethel , Josiah removed all the shrines at the high places that the kings of Israel had built in the towns of Samaria and that had aroused the Lord ’ s anger .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	20	Josiah slaughtered all the priests of those high places on the altars and burned human bones on them . Then he went back to Jerusalem .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	21	The king gave this order to all the people : ‘ Celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God , as it is written in this Book of the Covenant. ’
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	22	Neither in the days of the judges who led Israel nor in the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah had any such Passover been observed .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	24	Furthermore , Josiah got rid of the mediums and spiritists , the household gods , the idols and all the other detestable things seen in Judah and Jerusalem . This he did to fulfil the requirements of the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had discovered in the temple of the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	25	Neither before nor after Josiah was there a king like him who turned to the Lord as he did – with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength , in accordance with all the Law of Moses .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	26	Nevertheless , the Lord did not turn away from the heat of his fierce anger , which burned against Judah because of all that Manasseh had done to arouse his anger .
NIVUK	2%20Kings	23	27	So the Lord said , ‘ I will remove Judah also from my presence as I removed Israel , and I will reject Jerusalem , the city I chose , and this temple , about which I said , “ My Name shall be there. ” [ b ] ’

NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	21	12	three years of famine , three months of being swept away [ a ] before your enemies , with their swords overtaking you , or three days of the sword of the Lord – days of plague in the land , with the angel of the Lord ravaging every part of Israel. ” Now then , decide how I should answer the one who sent me. ’
NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	21	13	David said to Gad , ‘ I am in deep distress . Let me fall into the hands of the Lord , for his mercy is very great ; but do not let me fall into human hands. ’
NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	21	14	So the Lord sent a plague on Israel , and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead .
NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	21	15	And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem . But as the angel was doing so , the Lord saw it and relented concerning the disaster and said to the angel who was destroying the people , ‘ Enough ! Withdraw your hand. ’ The angel of the Lord was then standing at the threshing-floor of Araunah [ b ] the Jebusite .
NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	21	16	David looked up and saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth , with a drawn sword in his hand extended over Jerusalem . Then David and the elders , clothed in sackcloth , fell face down .
NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	21	17	David said to God , ‘ Was it not I who ordered the fighting men to be counted ? I , the shepherd , [ c ] have sinned and done wrong . These are but sheep . What have they done ? Lord my God , let your hand fall on me and my family , but do not let this plague remain on your people. ’ David builds an altar
NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	21	18	Then the angel of the Lord ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite .
NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	21	19	So David went up in obedience to the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	21	20	While Araunah was threshing wheat , he turned and saw the angel ; his four sons who were with him hid themselves .
NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	21	22	David said to him , ‘ Let me have the site of your threshing-floor so that I can build an altar to the Lord , that the plague on the people may be stopped . Sell it to me at the full price. ’
NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	21	23	Araunah said to David , ‘ Take it ! Let my lord the king do whatever pleases him . Look , I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings , the threshing-sledges for the wood , and the wheat for the grain offering . I will give all this. ’
NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	21	24	But King David replied to Araunah , ‘ No , I insist on paying the full price . I will not take for the Lord what is yours , or sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me nothing. ’
NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	21	25	So David paid Araunah six hundred shekels [ d ] of gold for the site .
NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	21	26	David built an altar to the Lord there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings . He called on the Lord , and the Lord answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering .
NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	21	27	Then the Lord spoke to the angel , and he put his sword back into its sheath .
NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	21	28	At that time , when David saw that the Lord had answered him on the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite , he offered sacrifices there .
NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	21	29	The tabernacle of the Lord , which Moses had made in the wilderness , and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gibeon .

NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	22	10	He is the one who will build a house for my Name . He will be my son , and I will be his father . And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever. ”

NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	22	18	He said to them , ‘ Is not the Lord your God with you ? And has he not granted you rest on every side ? For he has given the inhabitants of the land into my hands , and the land is subject to the Lord and to his people .
NIVUK	1%20Chronicles	22	19	Now devote your heart and soul to seeking the Lord your God .

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	5	4	When all the elders of Israel had arrived , the Levites took up the ark ,
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	5	6	and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark , sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	5	7	The priests then brought the ark of the Lord ’ s covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple , the Most Holy Place , and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim .

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	6	4	Then he said : ‘ Praise be to the Lord , the God of Israel , who with his hands has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to my father David . For he said ,
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	6	5	“ Since the day I brought my people out of Egypt , I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built so that my Name might be there , nor have I chosen anyone to be ruler over my people Israel .

He stood on the platform and then knelt down before the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands towards heaven .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	6	14	He said : ‘ Lord , the God of Israel , there is no God like you in heaven or on earth – you who keep your covenant of love with your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way .

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	7	7	Solomon consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the Lord , and there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings , because the bronze altar he had made could not hold the burnt offerings , the grain offerings and the fat portions .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	7	3	When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the Lord above the temple , they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground , and they worshipped and gave thanks to the Lord , saying , ‘ He is good ; his love endures for ever. ’

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	10	10	The young men who had grown up with him replied , ‘ The people have said to you , “ Your father put a heavy yoke on us , but make our yoke lighter. ” Now tell them , “ My little finger is thicker than my father ’ s waist .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	10	3	So they sent for Jeroboam , and he and all Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him :
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	10	4	‘ Your father put a heavy yoke on us , but now lighten the harsh labour and the heavy yoke he put on us , and we will serve you. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	10	5	Rehoboam answered , ‘ Come back to me in three days. ’ So the people went away .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	10	6	Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime . ‘ How would you advise me to answer these people ? ’ he asked .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	10	7	They replied , ‘ If you will be kind to these people and please them and give them a favourable answer , they will always be your servants. ’

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	12	12	Because Rehoboam humbled himself , the Lord ’ s anger turned from him , and he was not totally destroyed . Indeed , there was some good in Judah .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	12	3	With twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen and the innumerable troops of Libyans , Sukkites and Cushites [ b ] that came with him from Egypt ,
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	12	4	he captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	12	5	Then the prophet Shemaiah came to Rehoboam and to the leaders of Judah who had assembled in Jerusalem for fear of Shishak , and he said to them , ‘ This is what the Lord says : “ You have abandoned me ; therefore , I now abandon you to Shishak. ” ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	12	6	The leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said , ‘ The Lord is just. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	12	7	When the Lord saw that they humbled themselves , this word of the Lord came to Shemaiah : ‘ Since they have humbled themselves , I will not destroy them but will soon give them deliverance . My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	12	8	They will , however , become subject to him , so that they may learn the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands. ’

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	12	15	As for the events of Rehoboam ’ s reign , from beginning to end , are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer that deal with genealogies ? There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam .

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	13	7	Some worthless scoundrels gathered around him and opposed Rehoboam son of Solomon when he was young and indecisive and not strong enough to resist them .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	13	8	‘ And now you plan to resist the kingdom of the Lord , which is in the hands of David ’ s descendants . You are indeed a vast army and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	13	9	But didn ’ t you drive out the priests of the Lord , the sons of Aaron , and the Levites , and make priests of your own as the peoples of other lands do ? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may become a priest of what are not gods .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	13	10	‘ As for us , the Lord is our God , and we have not forsaken him . The priests who serve the Lord are sons of Aaron , and the Levites assist them .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	13	11	Every morning and evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the Lord . They set out the bread on the ceremonially clean table and light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening . We are observing the requirements of the Lord our God . But you have forsaken him .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	13	12	God is with us ; he is our leader . His priests with their trumpets will sound the battle cry against you . People of Israel , do not fight against the Lord , the God of your ancestors , for you will not succeed. ’

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	13	15	and the men of Judah raised the battle cry . At the sound of their battle cry , God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	13	16	The Israelites fled before Judah , and God delivered them into their hands .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	13	17	Abijah and his troops inflicted heavy losses on them , so that there were five hundred thousand casualties among Israel ’ s able men .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	13	18	The Israelites were subdued on that occasion , and the people of Judah were victorious because they relied on the Lord , the God of their ancestors .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	13	19	Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took from him the towns of Bethel , Jeshanah and Ephron , with their surrounding villages .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	13	20	Jeroboam did not regain power during the time of Abijah . And the Lord struck him down and he died .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	13	21	But Abijah grew in strength . He married fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters .

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	14	7	‘ Let us build up these towns , ’ he said to Judah , ‘ and put walls round them , with towers , gates and bars . The land is still ours , because we have sought the Lord our God ; we sought him and he has given us rest on every side. ’ So they built and prospered .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	14	8	Asa had an army of three hundred thousand men from Judah , equipped with large shields and with spears , and two hundred and eighty thousand from Benjamin , armed with small shields and with bows . All these were brave fighting men .

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	14	10	Asa went out to meet him , and they took up battle positions in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	14	11	Then Asa called to the Lord his God and said , ‘ Lord , there is no one like you to help the powerless against the mighty . Help us , Lord our God , for we rely on you , and in your name we have come against this vast army . Lord , you are our God ; do not let mere mortals prevail against you. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	14	12	The Lord struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah . The Cushites fled ,
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	14	13	and Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar . Such a great number of Cushites fell that they could not recover ; they were crushed before the Lord and his forces . The men of Judah carried off a large amount of plunder .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	14	15	They also attacked the camps of the herdsmen and carried off droves of sheep and goats and camels . Then they returned to Jerusalem . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	15	15	All Judah rejoiced about the oath because they had sworn it wholeheartedly . They sought God eagerly , and he was found by them . So the Lord gave them rest on every side .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	15	3	For a long time Israel was without the true God , without a priest to teach and without the law .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	15	4	But in their distress they turned to the Lord , the God of Israel , and sought him , and he was found by them .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	15	5	In those days it was not safe to travel about , for all the inhabitants of the lands were in great turmoil .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	15	6	One nation was being crushed by another and one city by another , because God was troubling them with every kind of distress .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	15	7	But as for you , be strong and do not give up , for your work will be rewarded. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	15	8	When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Azariah son of [ a ] Oded the prophet , he took courage . He removed the detestable idols from the whole land of Judah and Benjamin and from the towns he had captured in the hills of Ephraim . He repaired the altar of the Lord that was in front of the portico of the Lord ’ s temple .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	15	9	Then he assembled all Judah and Benjamin and the people from Ephraim , Manasseh and Simeon who had settled among them , for large numbers had come over to him from Israel when they saw that the Lord his God was with him .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	15	10	They assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa ’ s reign .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	15	11	At that time they sacrificed to the Lord seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep and goats from the plunder they had brought back .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	15	12	They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord , the God of their ancestors , with all their heart and soul .

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	15	16	King Asa also deposed his grandmother Maakah from her position as queen mother , because she had made a repulsive image for the worship of Asherah . Asa cut it down , broke it up and burned it in the Kidron Valley .

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	16	16	In the thirty-sixth year of Asa ’ s reign Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	16	3	‘ Let there be a treaty between me and you , ’ he said , ‘ as there was between my father and your father . See , I am sending you silver and gold . Now break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so that he will withdraw from me. ’

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	16	7	At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him : ‘ Because you relied on the king of Aram and not on the Lord your God , the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	16	8	Were not the Cushites [ b ] and Libyans a mighty army with great numbers of chariots and horsemen [ c ] ? Yet when you relied on the Lord , he delivered them into your hand .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	16	9	For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him . You have done a foolish thing , and from now on you will be at war. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	16	10	Asa was angry with the seer because of this ; he was so enraged that he put him in prison . At the same time Asa brutally oppressed some of the people .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	16	11	The events of Asa ’ s reign , from beginning to end , are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	16	12	In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was afflicted with a disease in his feet . Though his disease was severe , even in his illness he did not seek help from the Lord , but only from the doctors .

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	16	14	They buried him in the tomb that he had cut out for himself in the City of David . They laid him on a bier covered with spices and various blended perfumes , and they made a huge fire in his honour . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	17	3	The Lord was with Jehoshaphat because he followed the ways of his father David before him . He did not consult the Baals

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	18	Micaiah continued , ‘ Therefore hear the word of the Lord : I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the multitudes of heaven standing on his right and on his left .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	3	Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king of Judah , ‘ Will you go with me against Ramoth Gilead ? ’ Jehoshaphat replied , ‘ I am as you are , and my people as your people ; we will join you in the war. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	4	But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel , ‘ First seek the counsel of the Lord. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	5	So the king of Israel brought together the prophets – four hundred men – and asked them , ‘ Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead , or shall I not ? ’ ‘ Go , ’ they answered , ‘ for God will give it into the king ’ s hand. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	6	But Jehoshaphat asked , ‘ Is there no longer a prophet of the Lord here whom we can enquire of ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	7	The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat , ‘ There is still one prophet through whom we can enquire of the Lord , but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me , but always bad . He is Micaiah son of Imlah. ’ ‘ The king should not say such a thing , ’ Jehoshaphat replied .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	8	So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said , ‘ Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	9	Dressed in their royal robes , the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing-floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria , with all the prophets prophesying before them .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	10	Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns , and he declared , ‘ This is what the Lord says : “ With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed. ” ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	11	All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing . ‘ Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious , ’ they said , ‘ for the Lord will give it into the king ’ s hand. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	12	The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him , ‘ Look , the other prophets without exception are predicting success for the king . Let your word agree with theirs , and speak favourably. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	13	But Micaiah said , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , I can tell him only what my God says. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	14	When he arrived , the king asked him , ‘ Micaiah , shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead , or shall I not ? ’ ‘ Attack and be victorious , ’ he answered , ‘ for they will be given into your hand. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	15	The king said to him , ‘ How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	16	Then Micaiah answered , ‘ I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd , and the Lord said , “ These people have no master . Let each one go home in peace. ” ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	17	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , ‘ Didn ’ t I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me , but only bad ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	19	And the Lord said , “ Who will entice Ahab king of Israel into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there ? ” ‘ One suggested this , and another that .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	20	Finally , a spirit came forward , stood before the Lord and said , “ I will entice him. ” ‘ “ By what means ? ” the Lord asked .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	21	‘ “ I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets , ” he said . ‘ “ You will succeed in enticing him , ” said the Lord . “ Go and do it. ”
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	22	‘ So now the Lord has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours . The Lord has decreed disaster for you. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	23	Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face . ‘ Which way did the spirit from [ a ] the Lord go when he went from me to speak to you ? ’ he asked .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	24	Micaiah replied , ‘ You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	25	The king of Israel then ordered , ‘ Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king ’ s son ,

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	27	Micaiah declared , ‘ If you ever return safely , the Lord has not spoken through me. ’ Then he added , ‘ Mark my words , all you people ! ’ Ahab killed at Ramoth Gilead
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	28	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	29	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , ‘ I will enter the battle in disguise , but you wear your royal robes. ’ So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle .

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	31	When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat , they thought , ‘ This is the king of Israel. ’ So they turned to attack him , but Jehoshaphat cried out , and the Lord helped him . God drew them away from him ,

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	33	But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the breastplate and the scale armour . The king told the chariot driver , ‘ Wheel round and get me out of the fighting . I ’ ve been wounded. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	18	34	All day long the battle raged , and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening . Then at sunset he died . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	19	4	Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem , and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and turned them back to the Lord , the God of their ancestors .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	19	5	He appointed judges in the land , in each of the fortified cities of Judah .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	19	6	He told them , ‘ Consider carefully what you do , because you are not judging for mere mortals but for the Lord , who is with you whenever you give a verdict .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	19	7	Now let the fear of the Lord be on you . Judge carefully , for with the Lord our God there is no injustice or partiality or bribery. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	19	8	In Jerusalem also , Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites , priests and heads of Israelite families to administer the law of the Lord and to settle disputes . And they lived in Jerusalem .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	19	9	He gave them these orders : ‘ You must serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of the Lord .

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	19	11	‘ Amariah the chief priest will be over you in any matter concerning the Lord , and Zebadiah son of Ishmael , the leader of the tribe of Judah , will be over you in any matter concerning the king , and the Levites will serve as officials before you .

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	20	Early in the morning they left for the Desert of Tekoa . As they set out , Jehoshaphat stood and said , ‘ Listen to me , Judah and people of Jerusalem ! Have faith in the Lord your God and you will be upheld ; have faith in his prophets and you will be successful. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	3	Alarmed , Jehoshaphat resolved to enquire of the Lord , and he proclaimed a fast for all Judah .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	4	The people of Judah came together to seek help from the Lord ; indeed , they came from every town in Judah to seek him .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	5	Then Jehoshaphat stood up in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem at the temple of the Lord in the front of the new courtyard
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	6	and said : ‘ Lord , the God of our ancestors , are you not the God who is in heaven ? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations . Power and might are in your hand , and no one can withstand you .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	7	Our God , did you not drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and give it for ever to the descendants of Abraham your friend ?
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	8	They have lived in it and have built in it a sanctuary for your Name , saying ,
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	9	“ If calamity comes upon us , whether the sword of judgment , or plague or famine , we will stand in your presence before this temple that bears your Name and will cry out to you in our distress , and you will hear us and save us. ”
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	10	‘ But now here are men from Ammon , Moab and Mount Seir , whose territory you would not allow Israel to invade when they came from Egypt ; so they turned away from them and did not destroy them .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	11	See how they are repaying us by coming to drive us out of the possession you gave us as an inheritance .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	12	Our God , will you not judge them ? For we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us . We do not know what to do , but our eyes are on you. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	13	All the men of Judah , with their wives and children and little ones , stood there before the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	14	Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Jahaziel son of Zechariah , the son of Benaiah , the son of Jeiel , the son of Mattaniah , a Levite and descendant of Asaph , as he stood in the assembly .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	15	He said : ‘ Listen , King Jehoshaphat and all who live in Judah and Jerusalem ! This is what the Lord says to you : “ Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army . For the battle is not yours , but God ’ s .

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	17	You will not have to fight this battle . Take up your positions ; stand firm and see the deliverance the Lord will give you , Judah and Jerusalem . Do not be afraid ; do not be discouraged . Go out to face them tomorrow , and the Lord will be with you. ” ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	18	Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground , and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down in worship before the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	19	Then some Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up and praised the Lord , the God of Israel , with a very loud voice .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	21	After consulting the people , Jehoshaphat appointed men to sing to the Lord and to praise him for the splendour of his [ c ] holiness as they went out at the head of the army , saying : ‘ Give thanks to the Lord , for his love endures for ever. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	22	As they began to sing and praise , the Lord set ambushes against the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir who were invading Judah , and they were defeated .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	23	The Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the men from Mount Seir to destroy and annihilate them . After they finished slaughtering the men from Seir , they helped to destroy one another .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	24	When the men of Judah came to the place that overlooks the desert and looked towards the vast army , they saw only dead bodies lying on the ground ; no one had escaped .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	25	So Jehoshaphat and his men went to carry off their plunder , and they found among them a great amount of equipment and clothing [ d ] and also articles of value – more than they could take away . There was so much plunder that it took three days to collect it .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	26	On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berakah , where they praised the Lord . This is why it is called the Valley of Berakah [ e ] to this day .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	27	Then , led by Jehoshaphat , all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned joyfully to Jerusalem , for the Lord had given them cause to rejoice over their enemies .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	28	They entered Jerusalem and went to the temple of the Lord with harps and lyres and trumpets .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	29	The fear of God came on all the surrounding kingdoms when they heard how the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	30	And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace , for his God had given him rest on every side . The end of Jehoshaphat ’ s reign
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	31	So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah . He was thirty-five years old when he became king of Judah , and he reigned in Jerusalem for twenty-five years . His mother ’ s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	32	He followed the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them ; he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	33	The high places , however , were not removed , and the people still had not set their hearts on the God of their ancestors .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	34	The other events of Jehoshaphat ’ s reign , from beginning to end , are written in the annals of Jehu son of Hanani , which are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	35	Later , Jehoshaphat king of Judah made an alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel , whose ways were wicked .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	36	He agreed with him to construct a fleet of trading ships . [ f ] After these were built at Ezion Geber ,
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	20	37	Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat , saying , ‘ Because you have made an alliance with Ahaziah , the Lord will destroy what you have made. ’ The ships were wrecked and were not able to set sail to trade . [ g ] Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	21	Then Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David . And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	3	Their father had given them many gifts of silver and gold and articles of value , as well as fortified cities in Judah , but he had given the kingdom to Jehoram because he was his firstborn son . Jehoram king of Judah
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	4	When Jehoram established himself firmly over his father ’ s kingdom , he put all his brothers to the sword along with some of the officials of Israel .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	5	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem for eight years .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	6	He followed the ways of the kings of Israel , as the house of Ahab had done , for he married a daughter of Ahab . He did evil in the eyes of the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	7	Nevertheless , because of the covenant the Lord had made with David , the Lord was not willing to destroy the house of David . He had promised to maintain a lamp for him and his descendants for ever .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	8	In the time of Jehoram , Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	9	So Jehoram went there with his officers and all his chariots . The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders , but he rose up and broke through by night .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	10	To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah . Libnah revolted at the same time , because Jehoram had forsaken the Lord , the God of his ancestors .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	11	He had also built high places on the hills of Judah and had caused the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves and had led Judah astray .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	12	Jehoram received a letter from Elijah the prophet , which said : ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of your father David , says : “ You have not followed the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or of Asa king of Judah .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	13	But you have followed the ways of the kings of Israel , and you have led Judah and the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves , just as the house of Ahab did . You have also murdered your own brothers , members of your own family , men who were better than you .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	14	So now the Lord is about to strike your people , your sons , your wives and everything that is yours , with a heavy blow .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	15	You yourself will be very ill with a lingering disease of the bowels , until the disease causes your bowels to come out. ” ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	16	The Lord aroused against Jehoram the hostility of the Philistines and of the Arabs who lived near the Cushites .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	17	They attacked Judah , invaded it and carried off all the goods found in the king ’ s palace , together with his sons and wives . Not a son was left to him except Ahaziah , [ b ] the youngest .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	18	After all this , the Lord afflicted Jehoram with an incurable disease of the bowels .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	19	In the course of time , at the end of the second year , his bowels came out because of the disease , and he died in great pain . His people made no funeral fire in his honour , as they had for his predecessors .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	21	20	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem for eight years . He passed away , to no one ’ s regret , and was buried in the City of David , but not in the tombs of the kings . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	22	22	The people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah , Jehoram ’ s youngest son , king in his place , since the raiders , who came with the Arabs into the camp , had killed all the older sons . So Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	22	3	He too followed the ways of the house of Ahab , for his mother encouraged him to act wickedly .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	22	4	He did evil in the eyes of the Lord , as the house of Ahab had done , for after his father ’ s death they became his advisors , to his undoing .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	22	5	He also followed their counsel when he went with Joram [ b ] son of Ahab king of Israel to wage war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead . The Arameans wounded Joram ;

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	22	7	-
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	22	8	While Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab , he found the officials of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah ’ s relatives , who had been attending Ahaziah , and he killed them .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	22	9	He then went in search of Ahaziah , and his men captured him while he was hiding in Samaria . He was brought to Jehu and put to death . They buried him , for they said , ‘ He was a son of Jehoshaphat , who sought the Lord with all his heart. ’ So there was no one in the house of Ahaziah powerful enough to retain the kingdom . Athaliah and Joash
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	22	10	When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family of the house of Judah .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	22	11	But Jehosheba , [ e ] the daughter of King Jehoram , took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes who were about to be murdered and put him and his nurse in a bedroom . Because Jehosheba , [ f ] the daughter of King Jehoram and wife of the priest Jehoiada , was Ahaziah ’ s sister , she hid the child from Athaliah so that she could not kill him .

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	23	In the seventh year Jehoiada showed his strength . He made a covenant with the commanders of units of a hundred : Azariah son of Jeroham , Ishmael son of Jehohanan , Azariah son of Obed , Maaseiah son of Adaiah , and Elishaphat son of Zikri .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	3	the whole assembly made a covenant with the king at the temple of God . Jehoiada said to them , ‘ The king ’ s son shall reign , as the Lord promised concerning the descendants of David .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	4	Now this is what you are to do : a third of you priests and Levites who are going on duty on the Sabbath are to keep watch at the doors ,
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	5	a third of you at the royal palace and a third at the Foundation Gate , and all the others are to be in the courtyards of the temple of the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	6	No one is to enter the temple of the Lord except the priests and Levites on duty ; they may enter because they are consecrated , but all the others are to observe the Lord ’ s command not to enter . [ a ]
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	7	The Levites are to station themselves round the king , each with weapon in hand . Anyone who enters the temple is to be put to death . Stay close to the king wherever he goes. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	8	The Levites and all the men of Judah did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered . Each one took his men – those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty – for Jehoiada the priest had not released any of the divisions .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	9	Then he gave the commanders of units of a hundred the spears and the large and small shields that had belonged to King David and that were in the temple of God .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	10	He stationed all the men , each with his weapon in his hand , round the king – near the altar and the temple , from the south side to the north side of the temple .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	11	Jehoiada and his sons brought out the king ’ s son and put the crown on him ; they presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king . They anointed him and shouted , ‘ Long live the king ! ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	12	When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and cheering the king , she went to them at the temple of the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	13	She looked , and there was the king , standing by his pillar at the entrance . The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king , and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets , and musicians with their instruments were leading the praises . Then Athaliah tore her robes and shouted , ‘ Treason ! Treason ! ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	14	Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of units of a hundred , who were in charge of the troops , and said to them : ‘ Bring her out between the ranks [ b ] and put to the sword anyone who follows her. ’ For the priest had said , ‘ Do not put her to death at the temple of the Lord. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	15	So they seized her as she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds , and there they put her to death .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	16	Jehoiada then made a covenant that he , the people and the king [ c ] would be the Lord ’ s people .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	17	All the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down . They smashed the altars and idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	18	Then Jehoiada placed the oversight of the temple of the Lord in the hands of the Levitical priests , to whom David had made assignments in the temple , to present the burnt offerings of the Lord as written in the Law of Moses , with rejoicing and singing , as David had ordered .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	19	He also stationed gatekeepers at the gates of the Lord ’ s temple so that no one who was in any way unclean might enter .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	23	20	He took with him the commanders of hundreds , the nobles , the rulers of the people and all the people of the land and brought the king down from the temple of the Lord . They went into the palace through the Upper Gate and seated the king on the royal throne .

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	24	Although the Aramean army had come with only a few men , the Lord delivered into their hands a much larger army . Because Judah had forsaken the Lord , the God of their ancestors , judgment was executed on Joash .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	3	Jehoiada chose two wives for him , and he had sons and daughters .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	4	Some time later Joash decided to restore the temple of the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	5	He called together the priests and Levites and said to them , ‘ Go to the towns of Judah and collect the money due annually from all Israel , to repair the temple of your God . Do it now. ’ But the Levites did not act at once .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	6	Therefore the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him , ‘ Why haven ’ t you required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the Lord and by the assembly of Israel for the tent of the covenant law ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	7	Now the sons of that wicked woman Athaliah had broken into the temple of God and had used even its sacred objects for the Baals .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	8	At the king ’ s command , a chest was made and placed outside , at the gate of the temple of the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	9	A proclamation was then issued in Judah and Jerusalem that they should bring to the Lord the tax that Moses the servant of God had required of Israel in the wilderness .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	10	All the officials and all the people brought their contributions gladly , dropping them into the chest until it was full .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	11	Whenever the chest was brought in by the Levites to the king ’ s officials and they saw that there was a large amount of money , the royal secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and carry it back to its place . They did this regularly and collected a great amount of money .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	12	The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who carried out the work required for the temple of the Lord . They hired masons and carpenters to restore the Lord ’ s temple , and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the temple .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	13	The men in charge of the work were diligent , and the repairs progressed under them . They rebuilt the temple of God according to its original design and reinforced it .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	14	When they had finished , they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada , and with it were made articles for the Lord ’ s temple : articles for the service and for the burnt offerings , and also dishes and other objects of gold and silver . As long as Jehoiada lived , burnt offerings were presented continually in the temple of the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	15	Now Jehoiada was old and full of years , and he died at the age of a hundred and thirty .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	16	He was buried with the kings in the City of David , because of the good he had done in Israel for God and his temple . The wickedness of Joash
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	17	After the death of Jehoiada , the officials of Judah came and paid homage to the king , and he listened to them .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	18	They abandoned the temple of the Lord , the God of their ancestors , and worshipped Asherah poles and idols . Because of their guilt , God ’ s anger came on Judah and Jerusalem .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	19	Although the Lord sent prophets to the people to bring them back to him , and though they testified against them , they would not listen .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	20	Then the Spirit of God came on Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest . He stood before the people and said , ‘ This is what God says : “ Why do you disobey the Lord ’ s commands ? You will not prosper . Because you have forsaken the Lord , he has forsaken you. ” ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	21	But they plotted against him , and by order of the king they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the Lord ’ s temple .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	22	King Joash did not remember the kindness Zechariah ’ s father Jehoiada had shown him but killed his son , who said as he lay dying , ‘ May the Lord see this and call you to account. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	23	At the turn of the year , [ a ] the army of Aram marched against Joash ; it invaded Judah and Jerusalem and killed all the leaders of the people . They sent all the plunder to their king in Damascus .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	25	When the Arameans withdrew , they left Joash severely wounded . His officials conspired against him for murdering the son of Jehoiada the priest , and they killed him in his bed . So he died and was buried in the City of David , but not in the tombs of the kings .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	26	Those who conspired against him were Zabad , [ b ] son of Shimeath an Ammonite woman , and Jehozabad , son of Shimrith [ c ] a Moabite woman .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	24	27	The account of his sons , the many prophecies about him , and the record of the restoration of the temple of God are written in the annotations on the book of the kings . And Amaziah his son succeeded him as king . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	4	Yet he did not put their children to death , but acted in accordance with what is written in the Law , in the Book of Moses , where the Lord commanded : ‘ Parents shall not be put to death for their children , nor children be put to death for their parents ; each will die for their own sin. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	5	Amaziah called the people of Judah together and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin . He then mustered those twenty years old or more and found that there were three hundred thousand men fit for military service , able to handle the spear and shield .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	6	He also hired a hundred thousand fighting men from Israel for a hundred talents [ b ] of silver .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	7	But a man of God came to him and said , ‘ Your Majesty , these troops from Israel must not march with you , for the Lord is not with Israel – not with any of the people of Ephraim .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	8	Even if you go and fight courageously in battle , God will overthrow you before the enemy , for God has the power to help or to overthrow. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	9	-
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	10	So Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home . They were furious with Judah and left for home in a great rage .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	11	Amaziah then marshalled his strength and led his army to the Valley of Salt , where he killed ten thousand men of Seir .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	12	The army of Judah also captured ten thousand men alive , took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down so that all were dashed to pieces .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	13	Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had sent back and had not allowed to take part in the war raided towns belonging to Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon . They killed three thousand people and carried off great quantities of plunder .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	14	When Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites , he brought back the gods of the people of Seir . He set them up as his own gods , bowed down to them and burned sacrifices to them .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	15	The anger of the Lord burned against Amaziah , and he sent a prophet to him , who said , ‘ Why do you consult this people ’ s gods , which could not save their own people from your hand ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	16	While he was still speaking , the king said to him , ‘ Have we appointed you an advisor to the king ? Stop ! Why be struck down ? ’ So the prophet stopped but said , ‘ I know that God has determined to destroy you , because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	17	After Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisors , he sent this challenge to Jehoash [ c ] son of Jehoahaz , the son of Jehu , king of Israel : ‘ Come , let us face each other in battle. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	18	,
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	19	You say to yourself that you have defeated Edom , and now you are arrogant and proud . But stay at home ! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also ? ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	20	Amaziah , however , would not listen , for God so worked that he might deliver them into the hands of Jehoash , because they sought the gods of Edom .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	21	,
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	22	Judah was routed by Israel , and every man fled to his home .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	23	and
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	24	He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the temple of God that had been in the care of Obed-Edom , together with the palace treasures and the hostages , and returned to Samaria .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	26	As for the other events of Amaziah ’ s reign , from beginning to end , are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel ?
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	27	From the time that Amaziah turned away from following the Lord , they conspired against him in Jerusalem and he fled to Lachish , but they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	25	28	He was brought back by horse and was buried with his ancestors in the City of Judah . [ f ] Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	26	3	Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem for fifty-two years . His mother ’ s name was Jekoliah ; she was from Jerusalem .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	26	4	He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord , just as his father Amaziah had done .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	26	5	He sought God during the days of Zechariah , who instructed him in the fear [ b ] of God . As long as he sought the Lord , God gave him success .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	26	6	He went to war against the Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath , Jabneh and Ashdod . He then rebuilt towns near Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	26	7	God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabs who lived in Gur Baal and against the Meunites .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	26	8	The Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah , and his fame spread as far as the border of Egypt , because he had become very powerful .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	26	9	Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate , at the Valley Gate and at the angle of the wall , and he fortified them .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	26	10	He also built towers in the wilderness and dug many cisterns , because he had much livestock in the foothills and in the plain . He had people working his fields and vineyards in the hills and in the fertile lands , for he loved the soil .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	26	11	Uzziah had a well-trained army , ready to go out by divisions according to their numbers as mustered by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer under the direction of Hananiah , one of the royal officials .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	26	12	The total number of family leaders over the fighting men was 2,600 .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	26	13	Under their command was an army of 307,500 men trained for war , a powerful force to support the king against his enemies .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	26	14	Uzziah provided shields , spears , helmets , coats of armour , bows and slingstones for the entire army .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	26	15	In Jerusalem he made devices invented for use on the towers and on the corner defences so that soldiers could shoot arrows and hurl large stones from the walls . His fame spread far and wide , for he was greatly helped until he became powerful .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	26	16	But after Uzziah became powerful , his pride led to his downfall . He was unfaithful to the Lord his God , and entered the temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar of incense .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	26	17	Azariah the priest with eighty other courageous priests of the Lord followed him in .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	26	18	They confronted King Uzziah and said , ‘ It is not right for you , Uzziah , to burn incense to the Lord . That is for the priests , the descendants of Aaron , who have been consecrated to burn incense . Leave the sanctuary , for you have been unfaithful ; and you will not be honoured by the Lord God. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	26	19	Uzziah , who had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense , became angry . While he was raging at the priests in their presence before the incense altar in the Lord ’ s temple , leprosy [ c ] broke out on his forehead .

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	28	Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem for sixteen years . Unlike David his father , he did not do what was right in the eyes of the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	3	He burned sacrifices in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and sacrificed his children in the fire , engaging in the detestable practices of the nations that the Lord had driven out before the Israelites .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	4	He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places , on the hilltops and under every spreading tree .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	5	Therefore the Lord his God delivered him into the hands of the king of Aram . The Arameans defeated him and took many of his people as prisoners and brought them to Damascus . He was also given into the hands of the king of Israel , who inflicted heavy casualties on him .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	6	In one day Pekah son of Remaliah killed a hundred and twenty thousand soldiers in Judah – because Judah had forsaken the Lord , the God of their ancestors .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	7	Zikri , an Ephraimite warrior , killed Maaseiah the king ’ s son , Azrikam the officer in charge of the palace , and Elkanah , second to the king .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	8	The men of Israel took captive from their fellow Israelites who were from Judah two hundred thousand wives , sons and daughters . They also took a great deal of plunder , which they carried back to Samaria .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	9	But a prophet of the Lord named Oded was there , and he went out to meet the army when it returned to Samaria . He said to them , ‘ Because the Lord , the God of your ancestors , was angry with Judah , he gave them into your hand . But you have slaughtered them in a rage that reaches to heaven .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	10	And now you intend to make the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem your slaves . But aren ’ t you also guilty of sins against the Lord your God ?
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	11	Now listen to me ! Send back your fellow Israelites that you have taken as prisoners , for the Lord ’ s fierce anger rests on you. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	12	Then some of the leaders in Ephraim – Azariah son of Jehohanan , Berekiah son of Meshillemoth , Jehizkiah son of Shallum , and Amasa son of Hadlai – confronted those who were arriving from the war .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	13	‘ You must not bring those prisoners here , ’ they said , ‘ or we will be guilty before the Lord . Do you intend to add to our sin and guilt ? For our guilt is already great , and his fierce anger rests on Israel. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	14	So the soldiers gave up the prisoners and plunder in the presence of the officials and all the assembly .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	15	The men designated by name took the prisoners , and from the plunder they clothed all who were naked . They provided them with clothes and sandals , food and drink , and healing balm . All those who were weak they put on donkeys . So they took them back to their fellow Israelites at Jericho , the City of Palms , and returned to Samaria .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	16	At that time King Ahaz sent to the kings [ a ] of Assyria for help .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	17	The Edomites had again come and attacked Judah and carried away prisoners ,
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	18	while the Philistines had raided towns in the foothills and in the Negev of Judah . They captured and occupied Beth Shemesh , Aijalon and Gederoth , as well as Soko , Timnah and Gimzo , with their surrounding villages .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	19	The Lord had humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel , [ b ] for he had promoted wickedness in Judah and had been most unfaithful to the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	20	Tiglath-Pileser [ c ] king of Assyria came to him , but gave him trouble instead of help .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	21	Ahaz took some of the things from the temple of the Lord and from the royal palace and from the officials and presented them to the king of Assyria , but that did not help him .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	22	In his time of trouble King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	23	He offered sacrifices to the gods of Damascus , who had defeated him ; for he thought , ‘ Since the gods of the kings of Aram have helped them , I will sacrifice to them so that they will help me. ’ But they were his downfall and the downfall of all Israel .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	24	Ahaz gathered together the furnishings from the temple of God and cut them in pieces . He shut the doors of the Lord ’ s temple and set up altars at every street corner in Jerusalem .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	25	In every town in Judah he built high places to burn sacrifices to other gods and aroused the anger of the Lord , the God of his ancestors .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	26	The other events of his reign and all his ways , from beginning to end , are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	28	27	Ahaz rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city of Jerusalem , but he was not placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel . And Hezekiah his son succeeded him as king . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	29	When the offerings were finished , the king and everyone present with him knelt down and worshipped .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	3	In the first month of the first year of his reign , he opened the doors of the temple of the Lord and repaired them .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	4	He brought in the priests and the Levites , assembled them in the square on the east side
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	5	and said , ‘ Listen to me , Levites ! Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the temple of the Lord , the God of your ancestors . Remove all defilement from the sanctuary .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	6	Our parents were unfaithful ; they did evil in the eyes of the Lord our God and forsook him . They turned their faces away from the Lord ’ s dwelling-place and turned their backs on him .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	7	They also shut the doors of the portico and put out the lamps . They did not burn incense or present any burnt offerings at the sanctuary to the God of Israel .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	8	Therefore , the anger of the Lord has fallen on Judah and Jerusalem ; he has made them an object of dread and horror and scorn , as you can see with your own eyes .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	9	This is why our fathers have fallen by the sword and why our sons and daughters and our wives are in captivity .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	10	Now I intend to make a covenant with the Lord , the God of Israel , so that his fierce anger will turn away from us .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	11	My sons , do not be negligent now , for the Lord has chosen you to stand before him and serve him , to minister before him and to burn incense. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	12	Then these Levites set to work : from the Kohathites , Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah ; from the Merarites , Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel ; from the Gershonites , Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah ;
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	13	from the descendants of Elizaphan , Shimri and Jeiel ; from the descendants of Asaph , Zechariah and Mattaniah ;
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	14	from the descendants of Heman , Jehiel and Shimei ; from the descendants of Jeduthun , Shemaiah and Uzziel .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	15	When they had assembled their fellow Levites and consecrated themselves , they went in to purify the temple of the Lord , as the king had ordered , following the word of the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	16	The priests went into the sanctuary of the Lord to purify it . They brought out to the courtyard of the Lord ’ s temple everything unclean that they found in the temple of the Lord . The Levites took it and carried it out to the Kidron Valley .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	17	They began the consecration on the first day of the first month , and by the eighth day of the month they reached the portico of the Lord . For eight more days they consecrated the temple of the Lord itself , finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	18	Then they went in to King Hezekiah and reported : ‘ We have purified the entire temple of the Lord , the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils , and the table for setting out the consecrated bread , with all its articles .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	19	We have prepared and consecrated all the articles that King Ahaz removed in his unfaithfulness while he was king . They are now in front of the Lord ’ s altar. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	20	Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the city officials together and went up to the temple of the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	21	They brought seven bulls , seven rams , seven male lambs and seven male goats as a sin offering [ a ] for the kingdom , for the sanctuary and for Judah . The king commanded the priests , the descendants of Aaron , to offer these on the altar of the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	22	So they slaughtered the bulls , and the priests took the blood and splashed it against the altar ; next they slaughtered the rams and splashed their blood against the altar ; then they slaughtered the lambs and splashed their blood against the altar .

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	25	He stationed the Levites in the temple of the Lord with cymbals , harps and lyres in the way prescribed by David and Gad the king ’ s seer and Nathan the prophet ; this was commanded by the Lord through his prophets .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	26	So the Levites stood ready with David ’ s instruments , and the priests with their trumpets .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	27	Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar . As the offering began , singing to the Lord began also , accompanied by trumpets and the instruments of David king of Israel .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	28	The whole assembly bowed in worship , while the musicians played and the trumpets sounded . All this continued until the sacrifice of the burnt offering was completed .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	30	King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to praise the Lord with the words of David and of Asaph the seer . So they sang praises with gladness and bowed down and worshipped .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	31	Then Hezekiah said , ‘ You have now dedicated yourselves to the Lord . Come and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings to the temple of the Lord. ’ So the assembly brought sacrifices and thank-offerings , and all whose hearts were willing brought burnt offerings .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	32	The number of burnt offerings the assembly brought was seventy bulls , a hundred rams and two hundred male lambs – all of them for burnt offerings to the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	33	The animals consecrated as sacrifices amounted to six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep and goats .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	34	The priests , however , were too few to skin all the burnt offerings ; so their relatives the Levites helped them until the task was finished and until other priests had been consecrated , for the Levites had been more conscientious in consecrating themselves than the priests had been .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	35	There were burnt offerings in abundance , together with the fat of the fellowship offerings and the drink offerings that accompanied the burnt offerings . So the service of the temple of the Lord was re-established .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	29	36	Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at what God had brought about for his people , because it was done so quickly . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	30	Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh , inviting them to come to the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the Lord , the God of Israel .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	3	They had not been able to celebrate it at the regular time because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people had not assembled in Jerusalem .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	4	The plan seemed right both to the king and to the whole assembly .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	5	They decided to send a proclamation throughout Israel , from Beersheba to Dan , calling the people to come to Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the Lord , the God of Israel . It had not been celebrated in large numbers according to what was written .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	6	At the king ’ s command , couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the king and from his officials , which read : ‘ People of Israel , return to the Lord , the God of Abraham , Isaac and Israel , that he may return to you who are left , who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	7	Do not be like your parents and your fellow Israelites , who were unfaithful to the Lord , the God of their ancestors , so that he made them an object of horror , as you see .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	8	Do not be stiff-necked , as your ancestors were ; submit to the Lord . Come to his sanctuary , which he has consecrated for ever . Serve the Lord your God , so that his fierce anger will turn away from you .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	9	If you return to the Lord , then your fellow Israelites and your children will be shown compassion by their captors and will return to this land , for the Lord your God is gracious and compassionate . He will not turn his face from you if you return to him. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	10	The couriers went from town to town in Ephraim and Manasseh , as far as Zebulun , but people scorned and ridiculed them .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	11	Nevertheless , some from Asher , Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	12	Also in Judah the hand of God was on the people to give them unity of mind to carry out what the king and his officials had ordered , following the word of the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	13	A very large crowd of people assembled in Jerusalem to celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the second month .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	14	They removed the altars in Jerusalem and cleared away the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	15	They slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month . The priests and the Levites were ashamed and consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the temple of the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	16	Then they took up their usual positions as prescribed in the Law of Moses the man of God . The priests splashed against the altar the blood handed to them by the Levites .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	17	Since many in the crowd had not consecrated themselves , the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all those who were not ceremonially clean and could not consecrate their lambs [ a ] to the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	18	Although most of the many people who came from Ephraim , Manasseh , Issachar and Zebulun had not purified themselves , yet they ate the Passover , contrary to what was written . But Hezekiah prayed for them , saying , ‘ May the Lord , who is good , pardon everyone
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	19	who sets their heart on seeking God – the Lord , the God of their ancestors – even if they are not clean according to the rules of the sanctuary. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	20	And the Lord heard Hezekiah and healed the people .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	21	The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great rejoicing , while the Levites and priests praised the Lord every day with resounding instruments dedicated to the Lord . [ b ]
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	22	Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites , who showed good understanding of the service of the Lord . For the seven days they ate their assigned portion and offered fellowship offerings and praised [ c ] the Lord , the God of their ancestors .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	23	The whole assembly then agreed to celebrate the festival seven more days ; so for another seven days they celebrated joyfully .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	24	Hezekiah king of Judah provided a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep and goats for the assembly , and the officials provided them with a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep and goats . A great number of priests consecrated themselves .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	25	The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced , along with the priests and Levites and all who had assembled from Israel , including the foreigners who had come from Israel and also those who resided in Judah .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	26	There was great joy in Jerusalem , for since the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	30	27	The priests and the Levites stood to bless the people , and God heard them , for their prayer reached heaven , his holy dwelling-place . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	31	When all this had ended , the Israelites who were there went out to the towns of Judah , smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles .

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	4	He ordered the people living in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and Levites so that they could devote themselves to the Law of the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	5	As soon as the order went out , the Israelites generously gave the firstfruits of their grain , new wine , olive oil and honey and all that the fields produced . They brought a great amount , a tithe of everything .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	6	The people of Israel and Judah who lived in the towns of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things dedicated to the Lord their God , and they piled them in heaps .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	7	They began doing this in the third month and finished in the seventh month .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	8	When Hezekiah and his officials came and saw the heaps , they praised the Lord and blessed his people Israel .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	9	Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps ;
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	10	and Azariah the chief priest , from the family of Zadok , answered , ‘ Since the people began to bring their contributions to the temple of the Lord , we have had enough to eat and plenty to spare , because the Lord has blessed his people , and this great amount is left over. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	11	Hezekiah gave orders to prepare storerooms in the temple of the Lord , and this was done .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	12	Then they faithfully brought in the contributions , tithes and dedicated gifts . Konaniah , a Levite , was the overseer in charge of these things , and his brother Shimei was next in rank .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	13	Jehiel , Azaziah , Nahath , Asahel , Jerimoth , Jozabad , Eliel , Ismakiah , Mahath and Benaiah were assistants of Konaniah and Shimei his brother . All these served by appointment of King Hezekiah and Azariah the official in charge of the temple of God .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	14	Kore son of Imnah the Levite , keeper of the East Gate , was in charge of the freewill offerings given to God , distributing the contributions made to the Lord and also the consecrated gifts .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	15	Eden , Miniamin , Jeshua , Shemaiah , Amariah and Shekaniah assisted him faithfully in the towns of the priests , distributing to their fellow priests according to their divisions , old and young alike .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	16	In addition , they distributed to the males three years old or more whose names were in the genealogical records – all who would enter the temple of the Lord to perform the daily duties of their various tasks , according to their responsibilities and their divisions .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	17	And they distributed to the priests enrolled by their families in the genealogical records and likewise to the Levites twenty years old or more , according to their responsibilities and their divisions .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	18	They included all the little ones , the wives , and the sons and daughters of the whole community listed in these genealogical records . For they were faithful in consecrating themselves .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	19	As for the priests , the descendants of Aaron , who lived on the farmlands around their towns or in any other towns , men were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among them and to all who were recorded in the genealogies of the Levites .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	20	This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah , doing what was good and right and faithful before the Lord his God .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	31	21	In everything that he undertook in the service of God ’ s temple and in obedience to the law and the commands , he sought his God and worked wholeheartedly . And so he prospered . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	32	The other events of Hezekiah ’ s reign and his acts of devotion are written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	3	he consulted with his officials and military staff about blocking off the water from the springs outside the city , and they helped him .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	4	They gathered a large group of people who blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land . ‘ Why should the kings [ a ] of Assyria come and find plenty of water ? ’ they said .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	5	Then he worked hard repairing all the broken sections of the wall and building towers on it . He built another wall outside that one and reinforced the terraces [ b ] of the City of David . He also made large numbers of weapons and shields .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	6	He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate and encouraged them with these words :
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	7	‘ Be strong and courageous . Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and the vast army with him , for there is a greater power with us than with him .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	8	With him is only the arm of flesh , but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles. ’ And the people gained confidence from what Hezekiah the king of Judah said .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	9	Later , when Sennacherib king of Assyria and all his forces were laying siege to Lachish , he sent his officers to Jerusalem with this message for Hezekiah king of Judah and for all the people of Judah who were there :
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	10	‘ This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says : on what are you basing your confidence , that you remain in Jerusalem under siege ?
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	11	When Hezekiah says , “ The Lord our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria , ” he is misleading you , to let you die of hunger and thirst .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	12	Did not Hezekiah himself remove this god ’ s high places and altars , saying to Judah and Jerusalem , “ You must worship before one altar and burn sacrifices on it ” ?
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	13	‘ Do you not know what I and my predecessors have done to all the peoples of the other lands ? Were the gods of those nations ever able to deliver their land from my hand ?
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	14	Who of all the gods of these nations that my predecessors destroyed has been able to save his people from me ? How then can your god deliver you from my hand ?
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	15	Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you and mislead you like this . Do not believe him , for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my predecessors . How much less will your god deliver you from my hand ! ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	16	Sennacherib ’ s officers spoke further against the Lord God and against his servant Hezekiah .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	17	The king also wrote letters ridiculing the Lord , the God of Israel , and saying this against him : ‘ Just as the gods of the peoples of the other lands did not rescue their people from my hand , so the god of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my hand. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	18	Then they called out in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall , to terrify them and make them afraid in order to capture the city .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	19	They spoke about the God of Jerusalem as they did about the gods of the other peoples of the world – the work of human hands .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	20	King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cried out in prayer to heaven about this .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	21	And the Lord sent an angel , who annihilated all the fighting men and the commanders and officers in the camp of the Assyrian king . So he withdrew to his own land in disgrace . And when he went into the temple of his god , some of his sons , his own flesh and blood , cut him down with the sword .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	22	So the Lord saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria and from the hand of all others . He took care of them [ c ] on every side .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	23	Many brought offerings to Jerusalem for the Lord and valuable gifts for Hezekiah king of Judah . From then on he was highly regarded by all the nations . Hezekiah ’ s pride , success and death
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	24	In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death . He prayed to the Lord , who answered him and gave him a miraculous sign .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	25	But Hezekiah ’ s heart was proud and he did not respond to the kindness shown him ; therefore the Lord ’ s wrath was on him and on Judah and Jerusalem .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	26	Then Hezekiah repented of the pride of his heart , as did the people of Jerusalem ; therefore the Lord ’ s wrath did not come on them during the days of Hezekiah .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	27	Hezekiah had very great wealth and honour , and he made treasuries for his silver and gold and for his precious stones , spices , shields and all kinds of valuables .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	28	He also made buildings to store the harvest of grain , new wine and olive oil ; and he made stalls for various kinds of cattle , and pens for the flocks .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	29	He built villages and acquired great numbers of flocks and herds , for God had given him very great riches .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	30	It was Hezekiah who blocked the upper outlet of the Gihon spring and channelled the water down to the west side of the City of David . He succeeded in everything he undertook .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	31	But when envoys were sent by the rulers of Babylon to ask him about the miraculous sign that had occurred in the land , God left him to test him and to know everything that was in his heart .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	32	33	Hezekiah rested with his ancestors and was buried on the hill where the tombs of David ’ s descendants are . All Judah and the people of Jerusalem honoured him when he died . And Manasseh his son succeeded him as king . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	33	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem for fifty-five years .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	3	He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had demolished ; he also erected altars to the Baals and made Asherah poles . He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshipped them .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	4	He built altars in the temple of the Lord , of which the Lord had said , ‘ My Name will remain in Jerusalem for ever. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	5	In both courts of the temple of the Lord , he built altars to all the starry hosts .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	6	He sacrificed his children in the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom , practised divination and witchcraft , sought omens , and consulted mediums and spiritists . He did much evil in the eyes of the Lord , arousing his anger .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	7	He took the image he had made and put it in God ’ s temple , of which God had said to David and to his son Solomon , ‘ In this temple and in Jerusalem , which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel , I will put my Name for ever .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	8	I will not again make the feet of the Israelites leave the land I assigned to your ancestors , if only they will be careful to do everything that I commanded them concerning all the laws , decrees and regulations given through Moses. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	9	But Manasseh led Judah and the people of Jerusalem astray , so that they did more evil than the nations the Lord had destroyed before the Israelites .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	10	The Lord spoke to Manasseh and his people , but they paid no attention .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	11	So the Lord brought against them the army commanders of the king of Assyria , who took Manasseh prisoner , put a hook in his nose , bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	12	In his distress he sought the favour of the Lord his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his ancestors .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	13	And when he prayed to him , the Lord was moved by his entreaty and listened to his plea ; so he brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom . Then Manasseh knew that the Lord is God .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	14	Afterwards he rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David , west of the Gihon spring in the valley , as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate and encircling the hill of Ophel ; he also made it much higher . He stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities in Judah .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	15	He got rid of the foreign gods and removed the image from the temple of the Lord , as well as all the altars he had built on the temple hill and in Jerusalem ; and he threw them out of the city .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	16	Then he restored the altar of the Lord and sacrificed fellowship offerings and thank-offerings on it , and told Judah to serve the Lord , the God of Israel .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	17	The people , however , continued to sacrifice at the high places , but only to the Lord their God .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	18	The other events of Manasseh ’ s reign , including his prayer to his God and the words the seers spoke to him in the name of the Lord , the God of Israel , are written in the annals of the kings of Israel . [ a ]
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	19	His prayer and how God was moved by his entreaty , as well as all his sins and unfaithfulness , and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself – all these are written in the records of the seers . [ b ]
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	20	Manasseh rested with his ancestors and was buried in his palace . And Amon his son succeeded him as king . Amon king of Judah
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	21	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem for two years .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	22	He did evil in the eyes of the Lord , as his father Manasseh had done . Amon worshipped and offered sacrifices to all the idols Manasseh had made .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	23	But unlike his father Manasseh , he did not humble himself before the Lord ; Amon increased his guilt .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	24	Amon ’ s officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	33	25	Then the people of the land killed all who had plotted against King Amon , and they made Josiah his son king in his place . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	34	Josiah was eight years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem for thirty-one years .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	3	In the eighth year of his reign , while he was still young , he began to seek the God of his father David . In his twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of high places , Asherah poles and idols .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	4	Under his direction the altars of the Baals were torn down ; he cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them , and smashed the Asherah poles and the idols . These he broke to pieces and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	5	He burned the bones of the priests on their altars , and so he purged Judah and Jerusalem .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	6	In the towns of Manasseh , Ephraim and Simeon , as far as Naphtali , and in the ruins around them ,
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	7	he tore down the altars and the Asherah poles and crushed the idols to powder and cut to pieces all the incense altars throughout Israel . Then he went back to Jerusalem .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	8	In the eighteenth year of Josiah ’ s reign , to purify the land and the temple , he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah and Maaseiah the ruler of the city , with Joah son of Joahaz , the recorder , to repair the temple of the Lord his God .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	9	They went to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the temple of God , which the Levites who were the gatekeepers had collected from the people of Manasseh , Ephraim and the entire remnant of Israel and from all the people of Judah and Benjamin and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	10	Then they entrusted it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the Lord ’ s temple . These men paid the workers who repaired and restored the temple .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	11	They also gave money to the carpenters and builders to purchase dressed stone , and timber for joists and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	12	The workers laboured faithfully . Over them to direct them were Jahath and Obadiah , Levites descended from Merari , and Zechariah and Meshullam , descended from Kohath . The Levites – all who were skilled in playing musical instruments –
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	13	had charge of the labourers and supervised all the workers from job to job . Some of the Levites were secretaries , scribes and gatekeepers . The Book of the Law found
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	14	While they were bringing out the money that had been taken into the temple of the Lord , Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the Lord that had been given through Moses .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	15	Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary , ‘ I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the Lord. ’ He gave it to Shaphan .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	16	Then Shaphan took the book to the king and reported to him : ‘ Your officials are doing everything that has been committed to them .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	17	They have paid out the money that was in the temple of the Lord and have entrusted it to the supervisors and workers. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	18	Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king , ‘ Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. ’ And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	19	When the king heard the words of the Law , he tore his robes .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	20	He gave these orders to Hilkiah , Ahikam son of Shaphan , Abdon son of Micah , [ a ] Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the king ’ s attendant :
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	21	‘ Go and enquire of the Lord for me and for the remnant in Israel and Judah about what is written in this book that has been found . Great is the Lord ’ s anger that is poured out on us because those who have gone before us have not kept the word of the Lord ; they have not acted in accordance with all that is written in this book. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	22	Hilkiah and those the king had sent with him [ b ] went to speak to the prophet Huldah , who was the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath , [ c ] the son of Hasrah , [ d ] keeper of the wardrobe . She lived in Jerusalem , in the New Quarter .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	23	She said to them , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : tell the man who sent you to me ,
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	24	“ This is what the Lord says : I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people – all the curses written in the book that has been read in the presence of the king of Judah .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	25	Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and aroused my anger by all that their hands have made , [ e ] my anger will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched. ”
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	26	Tell the king of Judah , who sent you to enquire of the Lord , “ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says concerning the words you heard :
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	27	because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before God when you heard what he spoke against this place and its people , and because you humbled yourself before me and tore your robes and wept in my presence , I have heard you , declares the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	28	Now I will gather you to your ancestors , and you will be buried in peace . Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place and on those who live here. ” ’ So they took her answer back to the king .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	29	Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	30	He went up to the temple of the Lord with the people of Judah , the inhabitants of Jerusalem , the priests and the Levites – all the people from the least to the greatest . He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant , which had been found in the temple of the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	31	The king stood by his pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the Lord – to follow the Lord and keep his commands , statutes and decrees with all his heart and all his soul , and to obey the words of the covenant written in this book .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	32	Then he made everyone in Jerusalem and Benjamin pledge themselves to it ; the people of Jerusalem did this in accordance with the covenant of God , the God of their ancestors .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	34	33	Josiah removed all the detestable idols from all the territory belonging to the Israelites , and he made all who were present in Israel serve the Lord their God . As long as he lived , they did not fail to follow the Lord , the God of their ancestors . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	2	He appointed the priests to their duties and encouraged them in the service of the Lord ’ s temple .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	35	Josiah celebrated the Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem , and the Passover lamb was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the first month .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	3	He said to the Levites , who instructed all Israel and who had been consecrated to the Lord : ‘ Put the sacred ark in the temple that Solomon son of David king of Israel built . It is not to be carried about on your shoulders . Now serve the Lord your God and his people Israel .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	4	Prepare yourselves by families in your divisions , according to the instructions written by David king of Israel and by his son Solomon .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	5	‘ Stand in the holy place with a group of Levites for each sub-division of the families of your fellow Israelites , the lay people .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	6	Slaughter the Passover lambs , consecrate yourselves and prepare the lambs for your fellow Israelites , doing what the Lord commanded through Moses. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	7	Josiah provided for all the lay people who were there a total of thirty thousand lambs and goats for the Passover offerings , and also three thousand cattle – all from the king ’ s own possessions .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	8	His officials also contributed voluntarily to the people and the priests and Levites . Hilkiah , Zechariah and Jehiel , the officials in charge of God ’ s temple , gave the priests two thousand six hundred Passover offerings and three hundred cattle .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	9	Also Konaniah along with Shemaiah and Nethanel , his brothers , and Hashabiah , Jeiel and Jozabad , the leaders of the Levites , provided five thousand Passover offerings and five hundred head of cattle for the Levites .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	10	The service was arranged and the priests stood in their places with the Levites in their divisions as the king had ordered .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	11	The Passover lambs were slaughtered , and the priests splashed against the altar the blood handed to them , while the Levites skinned the animals .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	12	They set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the sub-divisions of the families of the people to offer to the Lord , as it is written in the Book of Moses . They did the same with the cattle .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	13	They roasted the Passover animals over the fire as prescribed , and boiled the holy offerings in pots , cauldrons and pans and served them quickly to all the people .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	14	After this , they made preparations for themselves and for the priests , because the priests , the descendants of Aaron , were sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fat portions until nightfall . So the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the Aaronic priests .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	15	The musicians , the descendants of Asaph , were in the places prescribed by David , Asaph , Heman and Jeduthun the king ’ s seer . The gatekeepers at each gate did not need to leave their posts , because their fellow Levites made the preparations for them .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	16	So at that time the entire service of the Lord was carried out for the celebration of the Passover and the offering of burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord , as King Josiah had ordered .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	17	The Israelites who were present celebrated the Passover at that time and observed the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	18	The Passover had not been observed like this in Israel since the days of the prophet Samuel ; and none of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated such a Passover as did Josiah , with the priests , the Levites and all Judah and Israel who were there with the people of Jerusalem .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	19	This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of Josiah ’ s reign . The death of Josiah
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	20	After all this , when Josiah had set the temple in order , Necho king of Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates , and Josiah marched out to meet him in battle .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	21	But Necho sent messengers to him saying , ‘ What quarrel is there , king of Judah , between you and me ? It is not you I am attacking at this time , but the house with which I am at war . God has told me to hurry ; so stop opposing God , who is with me , or he will destroy you. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	22	Josiah , however , would not turn away from him , but disguised himself to engage him in battle . He would not listen to what Necho had said at God ’ s command but went to fight him on the plain of Megiddo .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	23	Archers shot King Josiah , and he told his officers , ‘ Take me away ; I am badly wounded. ’
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	24	So they took him out of his chariot , put him in his other chariot and brought him to Jerusalem , where he died . He was buried in the tombs of his ancestors , and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	25	Jeremiah composed laments for Josiah , and to this day all the male and female singers commemorate Josiah in the laments . These became a tradition in Israel and are written in the Laments .
NIVUK	2%20Chronicles	35	26	The other events of Josiah ’ s reign and his acts of devotion in accordance with what is written in the Law of the Lord –

NIVUK	Ezra	7	17	With this money be sure to buy bulls , rams and male lambs , together with their grain offerings and drink offerings , and sacrifice them on the altar of the temple of your God in Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Ezra	7	18	You and your fellow Israelites may then do whatever seems best with the rest of the silver and gold , in accordance with the will of your God .

NIVUK	Ezra	7	20	And anything else needed for the temple of your God that you are responsible to supply , you may provide from the royal treasury .
NIVUK	Ezra	7	21	Now I , King Artaxerxes , decree that all the treasurers of Trans-Euphrates are to provide with diligence whatever Ezra the priest , the teacher of the Law of the God of heaven , may ask of you –

NIVUK	Ezra	7	23	Whatever the God of heaven has prescribed , let it be done with diligence for the temple of the God of heaven . Why should his wrath fall on the realm of the king and of his sons ?
NIVUK	Ezra	7	24	You are also to know that you have no authority to impose taxes , tribute or duty on any of the priests , Levites , musicians , gatekeepers , temple servants or other workers at this house of God .

NIVUK	Ezra	9	9	Though we are slaves , our God has not forsaken us in our bondage . He has shown us kindness in the sight of the kings of Persia : he has granted us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins , and he has given us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Ezra	9	2	They have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons , and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them . And the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness. ’
NIVUK	Ezra	9	3	When I heard this , I tore my tunic and cloak , pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled .
NIVUK	Ezra	9	4	Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered round me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles . And I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice .
NIVUK	Ezra	9	5	Then , at the evening sacrifice , I rose from my self-abasement , with my tunic and cloak torn , and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the Lord my God
NIVUK	Ezra	9	6	and prayed : ‘ I am too ashamed and disgraced , my God , to lift up my face to you , because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens .
NIVUK	Ezra	9	7	From the days of our ancestors until now , our guilt has been great . Because of our sins , we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity , to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings , as it is today .
NIVUK	Ezra	9	8	‘ But now , for a brief moment , the Lord our God has been gracious in leaving us a remnant and giving us a firm place [ a ] in his sanctuary , and so our God gives light to our eyes and a little relief in our bondage .
NIVUK	Ezra	9	10	‘ But now , our God , what can we say after this ? For we have forsaken the commands
NIVUK	Ezra	9	11	you gave through your servants the prophets when you said : “ The land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples . By their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other .
NIVUK	Ezra	9	12	Therefore , do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons . Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time , that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance. ”
NIVUK	Ezra	9	13	‘ What has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt , and yet , our God , you have punished us less than our sins have deserved and have given us a remnant like this .
NIVUK	Ezra	9	14	Shall we then break your commands again and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices ? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us , leaving us no remnant or survivor ?
NIVUK	Ezra	9	15	Lord , the God of Israel , you are righteous ! We are left this day as a remnant .

NIVUK	Ezra	10	10	Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them , ‘ You have been unfaithful ; you have married foreign women , adding to Israel ’ s guilt .
NIVUK	Ezra	10	2	Then Shekaniah son of Jehiel , one of the descendants of Elam , said to Ezra , ‘ We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us . But in spite of this , there is still hope for Israel .
NIVUK	Ezra	10	3	Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children , in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God . Let it be done according to the Law .
NIVUK	Ezra	10	4	Rise up ; this matter is in your hands . We will support you , so take courage and do it. ’
NIVUK	Ezra	10	5	So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested . And they took the oath .
NIVUK	Ezra	10	6	Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib . While he was there , he ate no food and drank no water , because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles .
NIVUK	Ezra	10	7	A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Ezra	10	8	Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property , in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders , and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles .
NIVUK	Ezra	10	9	Within the three days , all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem . And on the twentieth day of the ninth month , all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God , greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain .
NIVUK	Ezra	10	11	Now honour [ a ] the Lord , the God of your ancestors , and do his will . Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives. ’
NIVUK	Ezra	10	12	The whole assembly responded with a loud voice : ‘ You are right ! We must do as you say .
NIVUK	Ezra	10	13	But there are many people here and it is the rainy season ; so we can not stand outside . Besides , this matter can not be taken care of in a day or two , because we have sinned greatly in this thing .
NIVUK	Ezra	10	14	Let our officials act for the whole assembly . Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time , along with the elders and judges of each town , until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us. ’
NIVUK	Ezra	10	15	Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah , supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite , opposed this .
NIVUK	Ezra	10	16	So the exiles did as was proposed . Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads , one from each family division , and all of them designated by name . On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases ,
NIVUK	Ezra	10	17	and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women . Those guilty of intermarriage

NIVUK	Nehemiah	1	1	The words of Nehemiah son of Hakaliah : In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year , while I was in the citadel of Susa ,
NIVUK	Nehemiah	1	2	Hanani , one of my brothers , came from Judah with some other men , and I questioned them about the Jewish remnant that had survived the exile , and also about Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	1	3	They said to me , ‘ Those who survived the exile and are back in the province are in great trouble and disgrace . The wall of Jerusalem is broken down , and its gates have been burned with fire. ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	1	4	When I heard these things , I sat down and wept . For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	1	5	Then I said : ‘ Lord , the God of heaven , the great and awesome God , who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments ,
NIVUK	Nehemiah	1	6	let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants , the people of Israel . I confess the sins we Israelites , including myself and my father ’ s family , have committed against you .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	1	7	We have acted very wickedly towards you . We have not obeyed the commands , decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	1	8	‘ Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses , saying , “ If you are unfaithful , I will scatter you among the nations ,

NIVUK	Nehemiah	2	2	so the king asked me , ‘ Why does your face look so sad when you are not ill ? This can be nothing but sadness of heart. ’ I was very much afraid ,
NIVUK	Nehemiah	2	3	but I said to the king , ‘ May the king live for ever ! Why should my face not look sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins , and its gates have been destroyed by fire ? ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	2	4	The king said to me , ‘ What is it you want ? ’ Then I prayed to the God of heaven ,
NIVUK	Nehemiah	2	5	and I answered the king , ‘ If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favour in his sight , let him send me to the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried so that I can rebuild it. ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	2	6	Then the king , with the queen sitting beside him , asked me , ‘ How long will your journey take , and when will you get back ? ’ It pleased the king to send me ; so I set a time .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	2	7	I also said to him , ‘ If it pleases the king , may I have letters to the governors of Trans-Euphrates , so that they will provide me safe-conduct until I arrive in Judah ?

NIVUK	Nehemiah	2	9	So I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates and gave them the king ’ s letters . The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me .

NIVUK	Nehemiah	2	11	I went to Jerusalem , and after staying there three days

NIVUK	Nehemiah	2	13	By night I went out through the Valley Gate towards the Jackal [ a ] Well and the Dung Gate , examining the walls of Jerusalem , which had been broken down , and its gates , which had been destroyed by fire .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	2	14	Then I moved on towards the Fountain Gate and the King ’ s Pool , but there was not enough room for my mount to get through ;
NIVUK	Nehemiah	2	15	so I went up the valley by night , examining the wall . Finally , I turned back and re-entered through the Valley Gate .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	2	16	The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing , because as yet I had said nothing to the Jews or the priests or nobles or officials or any others who would be doing the work .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	2	17	Then I said to them , ‘ You see the trouble we are in : Jerusalem lies in ruins , and its gates have been burned with fire . Come , let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem , and we will no longer be in disgrace. ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	2	18	I also told them about the gracious hand of my God on me and what the king had said to me . They replied , ‘ Let us start rebuilding. ’ So they began this good work .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	2	19	But when Sanballat the Horonite , Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard about it , they mocked and ridiculed us . ‘ What is this you are doing ? ’ they asked . ‘ Are you rebelling against the king ? ’

We his servants will start rebuilding , but as for you , you have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it. ’ Footnotes - Nehemiah 2:13 Or Serpent or Fig Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	4	Hear us , our God , for we are despised . Turn their insults back on their own heads . Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	2	and in the presence of his associates and the army of Samaria , he said , ‘ What are those feeble Jews doing ? Will they restore their wall ? Will they offer sacrifices ? Will they finish in a day ? Can they bring the stones back to life from those heaps of rubble – burned as they are ? ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	3	Tobiah the Ammonite , who was at his side , said , ‘ What they are building – even a fox climbing up on it would break down their wall of stones ! ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	5	Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight , for they have thrown insults in the face of [ b ] the builders .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	6	So we rebuilt the wall till all of it reached half its height , for the people worked with all their heart .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	7	But when Sanballat , Tobiah , the Arabs , the Ammonites and the people of Ashdod heard that the repairs to Jerusalem ’ s walls had gone ahead and that the gaps were being closed , they were very angry .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	8	They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up trouble against it .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	9	But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	10	Meanwhile , the people in Judah said , ‘ The strength of the labourers is giving out , and there is so much rubble that we can not rebuild the wall. ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	11	Also our enemies said , ‘ Before they know it or see us , we will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work. ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	12	Then the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times over , ‘ Wherever you turn , they will attack us. ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	13	Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places , posting them by families , with their swords , spears and bows .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	14	After I looked things over , I stood up and said to the nobles , the officials and the rest of the people , ‘ Don ’ t be afraid of them . Remember the Lord , who is great and awesome , and fight for your families , your sons and your daughters , your wives and your homes. ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	15	When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it , we all returned to the wall , each to our work .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	16	From that day on , half of my men did the work , while the other half were equipped with spears , shields , bows and armour . The officers posted themselves behind all the people of Judah
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	17	who were building the wall . Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other ,
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	18	and each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked . But the man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	19	Then I said to the nobles , the officials and the rest of the people , ‘ The work is extensive and spread out , and we are widely separated from each other along the wall .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	20	Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet , join us there . Our God will fight for us ! ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	21	So we continued the work with half the men holding spears , from the first light of dawn till the stars came out .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	22	At that time I also said to the people , ‘ Let every man and his helper stay inside Jerusalem at night , so that they can serve us as guards by night and as workers by day. ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	4	23	Neither I nor my brothers nor my men nor the guards with me took off our clothes ; each had his weapon , even when he went for water .

NIVUK	Nehemiah	5	5	Although we are of the same flesh and blood as our fellow Jews and though our children are as good as theirs , yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery . Some of our daughters have already been enslaved , but we are powerless , because our fields and our vineyards belong to others. ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	5	2	Some were saying , ‘ We and our sons and daughters are numerous ; in order for us to eat and stay alive , we must get grain. ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	5	3	Others were saying , ‘ We are mortgaging our fields , our vineyards and our homes to get grain during the famine. ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	5	4	Still others were saying , ‘ We have had to borrow money to pay the king ’ s tax on our fields and vineyards .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	5	6	When I heard their outcry and these charges , I was very angry .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	5	7	I pondered them in my mind and then accused the nobles and officials . I told them , ‘ You are charging your own people interest ! ’ So I called together a large meeting to deal with them
NIVUK	Nehemiah	5	8	and said : ‘ As far as possible , we have bought back our fellow Jews who were sold to the Gentiles . Now you are selling your own people , only for them to be sold back to us ! ’ They kept quiet , because they could find nothing to say .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	5	9	So I continued , ‘ What you are doing is not right . Shouldn ’ t you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies ?
NIVUK	Nehemiah	5	10	I and my brothers and my men are also lending the people money and grain . But let us stop charging interest !
NIVUK	Nehemiah	5	11	Give back to them immediately their fields , vineyards , olive groves and houses , and also the interest you are charging them – one per cent of the money , grain , new wine and olive oil. ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	5	12	‘ We will give it back , ’ they said . ‘ And we will not demand anything more from them . We will do as you say. ’ Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	5	13	I also shook out the folds of my robe and said , ‘ In this way may God shake out of their house and possessions anyone who does not keep this promise . So may such a person be shaken out and emptied ! ’ At this the whole assembly said , ‘ Amen , ’ and praised the Lord . And the people did as they had promised .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	5	14	Moreover , from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes , when I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah , until his thirty-second year – twelve years – neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	5	15	But the earlier governors – those preceding me – placed a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels [ a ] of silver from them in addition to food and wine . Their assistants also lorded it over the people . But out of reverence for God I did not act like that .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	5	16	Instead , I devoted myself to the work on this wall . All my men were assembled there for the work ; we [ b ] did not acquire any land .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	5	17	Furthermore , a hundred and fifty Jews and officials ate at my table , as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	5	18	Each day one ox , six choice sheep and some poultry were prepared for me , and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds . In spite of all this , I never demanded the food allotted to the governor , because the demands were heavy on these people .

NIVUK	Nehemiah	6	6	in which was written : ‘ It is reported among the nations – and Geshem [ b ] says it is true – that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt , and therefore you are building the wall . Moreover , according to these reports you are about to become their king
NIVUK	Nehemiah	6	2	Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message : ‘ Come , let us meet together in one of the villages [ a ] on the plain of Ono. ’ But they were scheming to harm me ;
NIVUK	Nehemiah	6	3	so I sent messengers to them with this reply : ‘ I am carrying on a great project and can not go down . Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you ? ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	6	4	Four times they sent me the same message , and each time I gave them the same answer .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	6	5	Then , the fifth time , Sanballat sent his assistant to me with the same message , and in his hand was an unsealed letter
NIVUK	Nehemiah	6	7	and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem : “ There is a king in Judah ! ” Now this report will get back to the king ; so come , let us meet together. ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	6	8	I sent him this reply : ‘ Nothing like what you are saying is happening ; you are just making it up out of your head. ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	6	9	They were all trying to frighten us , thinking , ‘ Their hands will get too weak for the work , and it will not be completed. ’ But I prayed , ‘ Now strengthen my hands. ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	6	10	One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah , the son of Mehetabel , who was shut in at his home . He said , ‘ Let us meet in the house of God , inside the temple , and let us close the temple doors , because men are coming to kill you – by night they are coming to kill you. ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	6	11	But I said , ‘ Should a man like me run away ? Or should someone like me go into the temple to save his life ? I will not go ! ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	6	12	I realised that God had not sent him , but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	6	13	He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this , and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	6	14	Remember Tobiah and Sanballat , my God , because of what they have done ; remember also the prophet Noadiah and how she and the rest of the prophets have been trying to intimidate me .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	6	15	So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul , in fifty-two days . Opposition to the completed wall
NIVUK	Nehemiah	6	16	When all our enemies heard about this , all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence , because they realised that this work had been done with the help of our God .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	6	17	Also , in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah , and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	6	18	For many in Judah were under oath to him , since he was son-in-law to Shekaniah son of Arah , and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	6	19	Moreover , they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what I said . And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me .

NIVUK	Nehemiah	9	25	They captured fortified cities and fertile land ; they took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things , wells already dug , vineyards , olive groves and fruit trees in abundance . They ate to the full and were well-nourished ; they revelled in your great goodness .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	9	26	‘ But they were disobedient and rebelled against you ; they turned their backs on your law . They killed your prophets , who had warned them in order to turn them back to you ; they committed awful blasphemies .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	9	27	So you delivered them into the hands of their enemies , who oppressed them . But when they were oppressed they cried out to you . From heaven you heard them , and in your great compassion you gave them deliverers , who rescued them from the hand of their enemies .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	9	28	‘ But as soon as they were at rest , they again did what was evil in your sight . Then you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies so that they ruled over them . And when they cried out to you again , you heard from heaven , and in your compassion you delivered them time after time .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	9	29	‘ You warned them in order to turn them back to your law , but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands . They sinned against your ordinances , of which you said , “ The person who obeys them will live by them. ” Stubbornly they turned their backs on you , became stiff-necked and refused to listen .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	9	30	For many years you were patient with them . By your Spirit you warned them through your prophets . Yet they paid no attention , so you gave them into the hands of the neighbouring peoples .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	9	31	But in your great mercy you did not put an end to them or abandon them , for you are a gracious and merciful God .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	9	32	‘ Now therefore , our God , the great God , mighty and awesome , who keeps his covenant of love , do not let all this hardship seem trifling in your eyes – the hardship that has come on us , on our kings and leaders , on our priests and prophets , on our ancestors and all your people , from the days of the kings of Assyria until today .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	9	33	In all that has happened to us , you have remained righteous ; you have acted faithfully , while we acted wickedly .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	9	34	Our kings , our leaders , our priests and our ancestors did not follow your law ; they did not pay attention to your commands or the statutes you warned them to keep .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	9	35	Even while they were in their kingdom , enjoying your great goodness to them in the spacious and fertile land you gave them , they did not serve you or turn from their evil ways .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	9	36	‘ But see , we are slaves today , slaves in the land you gave our ancestors so that they could eat its fruit and the other good things it produces .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	9	37	Because of our sins , its abundant harvest goes to the kings you have placed over us . They rule over our bodies and our cattle as they please . We are in great distress . The agreement of the people
NIVUK	Nehemiah	9	38	‘ In view of all this , we are making a binding agreement , putting it in writing , and our leaders , our Levites and our priests are affixing their seals to it. ’ [ d ] Footnotes - Nehemiah 9:5 Or God for ever and ever - Nehemiah 9:9 Or the Sea of Reeds - Nehemiah 9:22 One Hebrew manuscript and Septuagint ; most Hebrew manuscripts Sihon , that is , the country of the - Nehemiah 9:38 In Hebrew texts this verse ( 9:38 ) is numbered 10:1 .

NIVUK	Nehemiah	12	30	When the priests and Levites had purified themselves ceremonially , they purified the people , the gates and the wall .

NIVUK	Nehemiah	12	39	over the Gate of Ephraim , the Jeshanah [ h ] Gate , the Fish Gate , the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred , as far as the Sheep Gate . At the Gate of the Guard they stopped .

NIVUK	Nehemiah	12	47	So in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah , all Israel contributed the daily portions for the musicians and the gatekeepers . They also set aside the portion for the other Levites , and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron .

NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	13	I put Shelemiah the priest , Zadok the scribe , and a Levite named Pedaiah in charge of the storerooms and made Hanan son of Zakkur , the son of Mattaniah , their assistant , because they were considered trustworthy . They were made responsible for distributing the supplies to their fellow Levites .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	2	because they had not met the Israelites with food and water but had hired Balaam to call a curse down on them . ( Our God , however , turned the curse into a blessing . )
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	3	When the people heard this law , they excluded from Israel all who were of foreign descent .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	4	Before this , Eliashib the priest had been put in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God . He was closely associated with Tobiah ,
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	5	and he had provided him with a large room formerly used to store the grain offerings and incense and temple articles , and also the tithes of grain , new wine and olive oil prescribed for the Levites , musicians and gatekeepers , as well as the contributions for the priests .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	6	But while all this was going on , I was not in Jerusalem , for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king . Some time later I asked his permission
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	7	and came back to Jerusalem . Here I learned about the evil thing Eliashib had done in providing Tobiah a room in the courts of the house of God .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	8	I was greatly displeased and threw all Tobiah ’ s household goods out of the room .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	9	I gave orders to purify the rooms , and then I put back into them the equipment of the house of God , with the grain offerings and the incense .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	10	I also learned that the portions assigned to the Levites had not been given to them , and that all the Levites and musicians responsible for the service had gone back to their own fields .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	11	So I rebuked the officials and asked them , ‘ Why is the house of God neglected ? ’ Then I called them together and stationed them at their posts .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	12	All Judah brought the tithes of grain , new wine and olive oil into the storerooms .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	14	Remember me for this , my God , and do not blot out what I have so faithfully done for the house of my God and its services .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	15	In those days I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys , together with wine , grapes , figs and all other kinds of loads . And they were bringing all this into Jerusalem on the Sabbath . Therefore I warned them against selling food on that day .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	16	People from Tyre who lived in Jerusalem were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them in Jerusalem on the Sabbath to the people of Judah .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	17	I rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them , ‘ What is this wicked thing you are doing – desecrating the Sabbath day ?
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	18	Didn ’ t your ancestors do the same things , so that our God brought all this calamity on us and on this city ? Now you are stirring up more wrath against Israel by desecrating the Sabbath. ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	19	When evening shadows fell on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath , I ordered the doors to be shut and not opened until the Sabbath was over . I stationed some of my own men at the gates so that no load could be brought in on the Sabbath day .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	20	Once or twice the merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	21	But I warned them and said , ‘ Why do you spend the night by the wall ? If you do this again , I will arrest you. ’ From that time on they no longer came on the Sabbath .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	22	Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and go and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy . Remember me for this also , my God , and show mercy to me according to your great love .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	23	Moreover , in those days I saw men of Judah who had married women from Ashdod , Ammon and Moab .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	24	Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples , and did not know how to speak the language of Judah .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	25	I rebuked them and called curses down on them . I beat some of the men and pulled out their hair . I made them take an oath in God ’ s name and said : ‘ You are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons , nor are you to take their daughters in marriage for your sons or for yourselves .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	26	Was it not because of marriages like these that Solomon king of Israel sinned ? Among the many nations there was no king like him . He was loved by his God , and God made him king over all Israel , but even he was led into sin by foreign women .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	27	Must we hear now that you too are doing all this terrible wickedness and are being unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women ? ’
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	28	One of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite . And I drove him away from me .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	29	Remember them , my God , because they defiled the priestly office and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	30	So I purified the priests and the Levites of everything foreign , and assigned them duties , each to his own task .
NIVUK	Nehemiah	13	31	I also made provision for contributions of wood at designated times , and for the firstfruits . Remember me with favour , my God . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Esther	1	3	and in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his nobles and officials . The military leaders of Persia and Media , the princes , and the nobles of the provinces were present .
NIVUK	Esther	1	4	For a full
NIVUK	Esther	1	180	days he displayed the vast wealth of his kingdom and the splendour and glory of his majesty .
NIVUK	Esther	1	5	When these days were over , the king gave a banquet , lasting seven days , in the enclosed garden of the king ’ s palace , for all the people from the least to the greatest who were in the citadel of Susa .
NIVUK	Esther	1	6	The garden had hangings of white and blue linen , fastened with cords of white linen and purple material to silver rings on marble pillars . There were couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry , marble , mother-of-pearl and other costly stones .
NIVUK	Esther	1	7	Wine was served in goblets of gold , each one different from the other , and the royal wine was abundant , in keeping with the king ’ s liberality .
NIVUK	Esther	1	8	By the king ’ s command each guest was allowed to drink without restriction , for the king instructed all the wine stewards to serve each man what he wished .
NIVUK	Esther	1	9	Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes .
NIVUK	Esther	1	10	On the seventh day , when King Xerxes was in high spirits from wine , he commanded the seven eunuchs who served him – Mehuman , Biztha , Harbona , Bigtha , Abagtha , Zethar and Karkas –
NIVUK	Esther	1	11	to bring before him Queen Vashti , wearing her royal crown , in order to display her beauty to the people and nobles , for she was lovely to look at .
NIVUK	Esther	1	12	But when the attendants delivered the king ’ s command , Queen Vashti refused to come . Then the king became furious and burned with anger .
NIVUK	Esther	1	13	Since it was customary for the king to consult experts in matters of law and justice , he spoke with the wise men who understood the times
NIVUK	Esther	1	14	and were closest to the king – Karshena , Shethar , Admatha , Tarshish , Meres , Marsena and Memukan , the seven nobles of Persia and Media who had special access to the king and were highest in the kingdom .
NIVUK	Esther	1	15	‘ According to law , what must be done to Queen Vashti ? ’ he asked . ‘ She has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes that the eunuchs have taken to her. ’
NIVUK	Esther	1	16	Then Memukan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles , ‘ Queen Vashti has done wrong , not only against the king but also against all the nobles and the peoples of all the provinces of King Xerxes .
NIVUK	Esther	1	17	For the queen ’ s conduct will become known to all the women , and so they will despise their husbands and say , “ King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him , but she would not come. ”
NIVUK	Esther	1	18	This very day the Persian and Median women of the nobility who have heard about the queen ’ s conduct will respond to all the king ’ s nobles in the same way . There will be no end of disrespect and discord .
NIVUK	Esther	1	19	‘ Therefore , if it pleases the king , let him issue a royal decree and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media , which can not be repealed , that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes . Also let the king give her royal position to someone else who is better than she .
NIVUK	Esther	1	20	Then when the king ’ s edict is proclaimed throughout all his vast realm , all the women will respect their husbands , from the least to the greatest. ’
NIVUK	Esther	1	21	The king and his nobles were pleased with this advice , so the king did as Memukan proposed .
NIVUK	Esther	1	22	He sent dispatches to all parts of the kingdom , to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language , proclaiming that every man should be ruler over his own household , using his native tongue .

NIVUK	Esther	2	2	Then the king ’ s personal attendants proposed , ‘ Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king .
NIVUK	Esther	2	3	Let the king appoint commissioners in every province of his realm to bring all these beautiful young women into the harem at the citadel of Susa . Let them be placed under the care of Hegai , the king ’ s eunuch , who is in charge of the women ; and let beauty treatments be given to them .
NIVUK	Esther	2	4	Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. ’ This advice appealed to the king , and he followed it .
NIVUK	Esther	2	5	Now there was in the citadel of Susa a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin , named Mordecai son of Jair , the son of Shimei , the son of Kish ,
NIVUK	Esther	2	6	who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , among those taken captive with Jehoiachin [ a ] king of Judah .
NIVUK	Esther	2	7	Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah , whom he had brought up because she had neither father nor mother . This young woman , who was also known as Esther , had a lovely figure and was beautiful . Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter when her father and mother died .
NIVUK	Esther	2	8	When the king ’ s order and edict had been proclaimed , many young women were brought to the citadel of Susa and put under the care of Hegai . Esther also was taken to the king ’ s palace and entrusted to Hegai , who had charge of the harem .
NIVUK	Esther	2	9	She pleased him and won his favour . Immediately he provided her with her beauty treatments and special food . He assigned to her seven female attendants selected from the king ’ s palace and moved her and her attendants into the best place in the harem .
NIVUK	Esther	2	10	Esther had not revealed her nationality and family background , because Mordecai had forbidden her to do so .
NIVUK	Esther	2	11	Every day he walked to and fro near the courtyard of the harem to find out how Esther was and what was happening to her .
NIVUK	Esther	2	12	Before a young woman ’ s turn came to go in to King Xerxes , she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments prescribed for the women , six months with oil of myrrh and six with perfumes and cosmetics .
NIVUK	Esther	2	13	And this is how she would go to the king : anything she wanted was given to her to take with her from the harem to the king ’ s palace .
NIVUK	Esther	2	14	In the evening she would go there and in the morning return to another part of the harem to the care of Shaashgaz , the king ’ s eunuch who was in charge of the concubines . She would not return to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name .
NIVUK	Esther	2	15	When the turn came for Esther ( the young woman Mordecai had adopted , the daughter of his uncle Abihail ) to go to the king , she asked for nothing other than what Hegai , the king ’ s eunuch who was in charge of the harem , suggested . And Esther won the favour of everyone who saw her .
NIVUK	Esther	2	16	She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal residence in the tenth month , the month of Tebeth , in the seventh year of his reign .
NIVUK	Esther	2	17	Now the king was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women , and she won his favour and approval more than any of the other virgins . So he set a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti .
NIVUK	Esther	2	18	And the king gave a great banquet , Esther ’ s banquet , for all his nobles and officials . He proclaimed a holiday throughout the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality . Mordecai uncovers a conspiracy
NIVUK	Esther	2	19	When the virgins were assembled a second time , Mordecai was sitting at the king ’ s gate .
NIVUK	Esther	2	20	But Esther had kept secret her family background and nationality just as Mordecai had told her to do , for she continued to follow Mordecai ’ s instructions as she had done when he was bringing her up .
NIVUK	Esther	2	21	During the time Mordecai was sitting at the king ’ s gate , Bigthana [ b ] and Teresh , two of the king ’ s officers who guarded the doorway , became angry and conspired to assassinate King Xerxes .
NIVUK	Esther	2	22	But Mordecai found out about the plot and told Queen Esther , who in turn reported it to the king , giving credit to Mordecai .
NIVUK	Esther	2	23	And when the report was investigated and found to be true , the two officials were impaled on poles . All this was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king .

NIVUK	Esther	3	3	Then the royal officials at the king ’ s gate asked Mordecai , ‘ Why do you disobey the king ’ s command ? ’
NIVUK	Esther	3	2	All the royal officials at the king ’ s gate knelt down and paid honour to Haman , for the king had commanded this concerning him . But Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honour .
NIVUK	Esther	3	4	Day after day they spoke to him but he refused to comply . Therefore they told Haman about it to see whether Mordecai ’ s behaviour would be tolerated , for he had told them he was a Jew .
NIVUK	Esther	3	5	When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honour , he was enraged .
NIVUK	Esther	3	6	Yet having learned who Mordecai ’ s people were , he scorned the idea of killing only Mordecai . Instead Haman looked for a way to destroy all Mordecai ’ s people , the Jews , throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes .
NIVUK	Esther	3	7	In the twelfth year of King Xerxes , in the first month , the month of Nisan , the pur ( that is , the lot ) was cast in the presence of Haman to select a day and month . And the lot fell on [ a ] the twelfth month , the month of Adar .
NIVUK	Esther	3	8	Then Haman said to King Xerxes , ‘ There is a certain people dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom who keep themselves separate . Their customs are different from those of all other people , and they do not obey the king ’ s laws ; it is not in the king ’ s best interest to tolerate them .
NIVUK	Esther	3	9	If it pleases the king , let a decree be issued to destroy them , and I will give ten thousand talents [ b ] of silver to the king ’ s administrators for the royal treasury. ’
NIVUK	Esther	3	10	So the king took his signet ring from his finger and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha , the Agagite , the enemy of the Jews .
NIVUK	Esther	3	11	‘ Keep the money , ’ the king said to Haman , ‘ and do with the people as you please. ’
NIVUK	Esther	3	12	Then on the thirteenth day of the first month the royal secretaries were summoned . They wrote out in the script of each province and in the language of each people all Haman ’ s orders to the king ’ s satraps , the governors of the various provinces and the nobles of the various peoples . These were written in the name of King Xerxes himself and sealed with his own ring .
NIVUK	Esther	3	13	Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king ’ s provinces with the order to destroy , kill and annihilate all the Jews – young and old , women and children – on a single day , the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , the month of Adar , and to plunder their goods .
NIVUK	Esther	3	14	A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so that they would be ready for that day .
NIVUK	Esther	3	15	The couriers went out , spurred on by the king ’ s command , and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa . The king and Haman sat down to drink , but the city of Susa was bewildered . Footnotes - Esther 3:7 Septuagint ; Hebrew does not have And the lot fell on . - Esther 3:9 That is , about

NIVUK	Esther	4	4	When Esther ’ s eunuchs and female attendants came and told her about Mordecai , she was in great distress . She sent clothes for him to put on instead of his sackcloth , but he would not accept them .
NIVUK	Esther	4	2	But he went only as far as the king ’ s gate , because no one clothed in sackcloth was allowed to enter it .
NIVUK	Esther	4	3	In every province to which the edict and order of the king came , there was great mourning among the Jews , with fasting , weeping and wailing . Many lay in sackcloth and ashes .
NIVUK	Esther	4	5	Then Esther summoned Hathak , one of the king ’ s eunuchs assigned to attend her , and ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai and why .
NIVUK	Esther	4	6	So Hathak went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king ’ s gate .
NIVUK	Esther	4	7	Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him , including the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews .
NIVUK	Esther	4	8	He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict for their annihilation , which had been published in Susa , to show to Esther and explain it to her , and he told him to instruct her to go into the king ’ s presence to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people .
NIVUK	Esther	4	9	Hathak went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said .
NIVUK	Esther	4	10	Then she instructed him to say to Mordecai ,
NIVUK	Esther	4	11	‘ All the king ’ s officials and the people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned the king has but one law : that they be put to death unless the king extends the gold sceptre to them and spares their lives . But thirty days have passed since I was called to go to the king. ’
NIVUK	Esther	4	12	When Esther ’ s words were reported to Mordecai ,
NIVUK	Esther	4	13	he sent back this answer : ‘ Do not think that because you are in the king ’ s house you alone of all the Jews will escape .
NIVUK	Esther	4	14	For if you remain silent at this time , relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place , but you and your father ’ s family will perish . And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this ? ’
NIVUK	Esther	4	15	Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai :
NIVUK	Esther	4	16	‘ Go , gather together all the Jews who are in Susa , and fast for me . Do not eat or drink for three days , night or day . I and my attendants will fast as you do . When this is done , I will go to the king , even though it is against the law . And if I perish , I perish. ’

NIVUK	Esther	5	5	‘ Bring Haman at once , ’ the king said , ‘ so that we may do what Esther asks. ’ So the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared .
NIVUK	Esther	5	2	When he saw Queen Esther standing in the court , he was pleased with her and held out to her the gold sceptre that was in his hand . So Esther approached and touched the tip of the sceptre .
NIVUK	Esther	5	3	Then the king asked , ‘ What is it , Queen Esther ? What is your request ? Even up to half the kingdom , it will be given you. ’
NIVUK	Esther	5	4	‘ If it pleases the king , ’ replied Esther , ‘ let the king , together with Haman , come today to a banquet I have prepared for him. ’
NIVUK	Esther	5	6	As they were drinking wine , the king again asked Esther , ‘ Now what is your petition ? It will be given you . And what is your request ? Even up to half the kingdom , it will be granted. ’
NIVUK	Esther	5	7	Esther replied , ‘ My petition and my request is this :
NIVUK	Esther	5	8	If the king regards me with favour and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfil my request , let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for them . Then I will answer the king ’ s question. ’ Haman ’ s rage against Mordecai
NIVUK	Esther	5	9	Haman went out that day happy and in high spirits . But when he saw Mordecai at the king ’ s gate and observed that he neither rose nor showed fear in his presence , he was filled with rage against Mordecai .
NIVUK	Esther	5	10	Nevertheless , Haman restrained himself and went home . Calling together his friends and Zeresh , his wife ,
NIVUK	Esther	5	11	Haman boasted to them about his vast wealth , his many sons , and all the ways the king had honoured him and how he had elevated him above the other nobles and officials .
NIVUK	Esther	5	12	‘ And that ’ s not all , ’ Haman added . ‘ I ’ m the only person Queen Esther invited to accompany the king to the banquet she gave . And she has invited me along with the king tomorrow .
NIVUK	Esther	5	13	But all this gives me no satisfaction as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the king ’ s gate. ’
NIVUK	Esther	5	14	His wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him , ‘ Have a pole set up , reaching to a height of fifty cubits , [ a ] and ask the king in the morning to have Mordecai impaled on it . Then go with the king to the banquet and enjoy yourself. ’ This suggestion delighted Haman , and he had the pole set up . Footnotes - Esther 5:14 That is , about

NIVUK	Esther	6	6	When Haman entered , the king asked him , ‘ What should be done for the man the king delights to honour ? ’ Now Haman thought to himself , ‘ Who is there that the king would rather honour than me ? ’
NIVUK	Esther	6	2	It was found recorded there that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and Teresh , two of the king ’ s officers who guarded the doorway , who had conspired to assassinate King Xerxes .
NIVUK	Esther	6	3	‘ What honour and recognition has Mordecai received for this ? ’ the king asked . ‘ Nothing has been done for him , ’ his attendants answered .
NIVUK	Esther	6	4	The king said , ‘ Who is in the court ? ’ Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the palace to speak to the king about impaling Mordecai on the pole he had set up for him .
NIVUK	Esther	6	5	His attendants answered , ‘ Haman is standing in the court. ’ ‘ Bring him in , ’ the king ordered .
NIVUK	Esther	6	7	So he answered the king , ‘ For the man the king delights to honour ,
NIVUK	Esther	6	8	let them bring a royal robe the king has worn and a horse the king has ridden , one with a royal crest placed on its head .
NIVUK	Esther	6	9	Then let the robe and horse be entrusted to one of the king ’ s most noble princes . Let them robe the man the king delights to honour , and lead him on the horse through the city streets , proclaiming before him , “ This is what is done for the man the king delights to honour ! ” ’
NIVUK	Esther	6	10	‘ Go at once , ’ the king commanded Haman . ‘ Get the robe and the horse and do just as you have suggested for Mordecai the Jew , who sits at the king ’ s gate . Do not neglect anything you have recommended. ’
NIVUK	Esther	6	11	So Haman got the robe and the horse . He robed Mordecai , and led him on horseback through the city streets , proclaiming before him , ‘ This is what is done for the man the king delights to honour ! ’
NIVUK	Esther	6	12	Afterwards Mordecai returned to the king ’ s gate . But Haman rushed home , with his head covered in grief ,
NIVUK	Esther	6	13	and told Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him . His advisors and his wife Zeresh said to him , ‘ Since Mordecai , before whom your downfall has started , is of Jewish origin , you can not stand against him – you will surely come to ruin ! ’

NIVUK	Esther	7	7	The king got up in a rage , left his wine and went out into the palace garden . But Haman , realising that the king had already decided his fate , stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life .
NIVUK	Esther	7	2	and as they were drinking wine on the second day , the king again asked , ‘ Queen Esther , what is your petition ? It will be given you . What is your request ? Even up to half the kingdom , it will be granted. ’
NIVUK	Esther	7	3	Then Queen Esther answered , ‘ If I have found favour with you , Your Majesty , and if it pleases you , grant me my life – this is my petition . And spare my people – this is my request .
NIVUK	Esther	7	4	For I and my people have been sold to be destroyed , killed and annihilated . If we had merely been sold as male and female slaves , I would have kept quiet , because no such distress would justify disturbing the king . [ a ] ’
NIVUK	Esther	7	5	King Xerxes asked Queen Esther , ‘ Who is he ? Where is he – the man who has dared to do such a thing ? ’
NIVUK	Esther	7	6	Esther said , ‘ An adversary and enemy ! This vile Haman ! ’ Then Haman was terrified before the king and queen .
NIVUK	Esther	7	8	Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banqueting hall , Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining . The king exclaimed , ‘ Will he even molest the queen while she is with me in the house ? ’ As soon as the word left the king ’ s mouth , they covered Haman ’ s face .
NIVUK	Esther	7	9	Then Harbona , one of the eunuchs attending the king , said , ‘ A pole reaching to a height of fifty cubits [ b ] stands by Haman ’ s house . He had it set up for Mordecai , who spoke up to help the king. ’ The king said , ‘ Impale him on it ! ’

NIVUK	Esther	8	2	The king took off his signet ring , which he had reclaimed from Haman , and presented it to Mordecai . And Esther appointed him over Haman ’ s estate .
NIVUK	Esther	8	3	Esther again pleaded with the king , falling at his feet and weeping . She begged him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman the Agagite , which he had devised against the Jews .
NIVUK	Esther	8	4	Then the king extended the gold sceptre to Esther and she arose and stood before him .
NIVUK	Esther	8	5	‘ If it pleases the king , ’ she said , ‘ and if he regards me with favour and thinks it the right thing to do , and if he is pleased with me , let an order be written overruling the dispatches that Haman son of Hammedatha , the Agagite , devised and wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king ’ s provinces .
NIVUK	Esther	8	6	For how can I bear to see disaster fall on my people ? How can I bear to see the destruction of my family ? ’
NIVUK	Esther	8	7	King Xerxes replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew , ‘ Because Haman attacked the Jews , I have given his estate to Esther , and they have impaled him on the pole he set up .
NIVUK	Esther	8	9	At once the royal secretaries were summoned – on the twenty-third day of the third month , the month of Sivan . They wrote out all Mordecai ’ s orders to the Jews , and to the satraps , governors and nobles of the
NIVUK	Esther	8	127	provinces stretching from India to Cush . [ a ] These orders were written in the script of each province and the language of each people and also to the Jews in their own script and language .

NIVUK	Esther	9	9	Parmashta , Arisai , Aridai and Vaizatha ,
NIVUK	Esther	9	2	The Jews assembled in their cities in all the provinces of King Xerxes to attack those determined to destroy them . No one could stand against them , because the people of all the other nationalities were afraid of them .
NIVUK	Esther	9	3	And all the nobles of the provinces , the satraps , the governors and the king ’ s administrators helped the Jews , because fear of Mordecai had seized them .
NIVUK	Esther	9	4	Mordecai was prominent in the palace ; his reputation spread throughout the provinces , and he became more and more powerful .
NIVUK	Esther	9	5	The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword , killing and destroying them , and they did what they pleased to those who hated them .
NIVUK	Esther	9	6	In the citadel of Susa , the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men .
NIVUK	Esther	9	7	They also killed Parshandatha , Dalphon , Aspatha ,
NIVUK	Esther	9	8	Poratha , Adalia , Aridatha ,
NIVUK	Esther	9	10	the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha , the enemy of the Jews . But they did not lay their hands on the plunder .
NIVUK	Esther	9	11	The number of those killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king that same day .
NIVUK	Esther	9	12	The king said to Queen Esther , ‘ The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman in the citadel of Susa . What have they done in the rest of the king ’ s provinces ? Now what is your petition ? It will be given you . What is your request ? It will also be granted. ’
NIVUK	Esther	9	13	‘ If it pleases the king , ’ Esther answered , ‘ give the Jews in Susa permission to carry out this day ’ s edict tomorrow also , and let Haman ’ s ten sons be impaled on poles. ’
NIVUK	Esther	9	14	So the king commanded that this be done . An edict was issued in Susa , and they impaled the ten sons of Haman .
NIVUK	Esther	9	15	The Jews in Susa came together on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar , and they put to death in Susa three hundred men , but they did not lay their hands on the plunder .
NIVUK	Esther	9	16	Meanwhile , the remainder of the Jews who were in the king ’ s provinces also assembled to protect themselves and get relief from their enemies . They killed seventy-five thousand of them but did not lay their hands on the plunder .
NIVUK	Esther	9	17	This happened on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar , and on the fourteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy .
NIVUK	Esther	9	18	The Jews in Susa , however , had assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth , and then on the fifteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy .
NIVUK	Esther	9	19	That is why rural Jews – those living in villages – observe the fourteenth of the month of Adar as a day of joy and feasting , a day for giving presents to each other . Purim established
NIVUK	Esther	9	20	Mordecai recorded these events , and he sent letters to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King Xerxes , near and far ,
NIVUK	Esther	9	21	that they should celebrate annually the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar
NIVUK	Esther	9	22	as the time when the Jews got relief from their enemies , and as the month when their sorrow was turned into joy and their mourning into a day of celebration . He wrote to them to observe the days as days of feasting and joy and giving presents of food to one another and gifts to the poor .
NIVUK	Esther	9	23	So the Jews agreed to continue the celebration they had begun , doing what Mordecai had written to them .
NIVUK	Esther	9	24	For Haman son of Hammedatha , the Agagite , the enemy of all the Jews , had plotted against the Jews to destroy them and had cast the pur ( that is , the lot ) for their ruin and destruction .
NIVUK	Esther	9	25	But when the plot came to the king ’ s attention , [ a ] he issued written orders that the evil scheme Haman had devised against the Jews should come back on to his own head , and that he and his sons should be impaled on poles .
NIVUK	Esther	9	26	( Therefore these days were called Purim , from the word pur . ) Because of everything written in this letter and because of what they had seen and what had happened to them ,
NIVUK	Esther	9	27	the Jews took it on themselves to establish the custom that they and their descendants and all who join them should without fail observe these two days every year , in the way prescribed and at the time appointed .
NIVUK	Esther	9	28	These days should be remembered and observed in every generation by every family , and in every province and in every city . And these days of Purim should never fail to be celebrated by the Jews – nor should the memory of these days die out among their descendants .
NIVUK	Esther	9	29	So Queen Esther , daughter of Abihail , along with Mordecai the Jew , wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter concerning Purim .
NIVUK	Esther	9	30	And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in the
NIVUK	Esther	9	127	provinces of Xerxes ’ s kingdom – words of goodwill and assurance –
NIVUK	Esther	9	31	to establish these days of Purim at their designated times , as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had decreed for them , and as they had established for themselves and their descendants in regard to their times of fasting and lamentation .
NIVUK	Esther	9	32	Esther ’ s decree confirmed these regulations about Purim , and it was written down in the records . Footnotes - Esther 9:25 Or when Esther came before the king Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Job	1	1	In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job . This man was blameless and upright ; he feared God and shunned evil .
NIVUK	Job	1	2	He had seven sons and three daughters ,
NIVUK	Job	1	3	and he owned seven thousand sheep , three thousand camels , five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys , and had a large number of servants . He was the greatest man among all the people of the East .
NIVUK	Job	1	4	His sons used to hold feasts in their homes on their birthdays , and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them .
NIVUK	Job	1	5	When a period of feasting had run its course , Job would make arrangements for them to be purified . Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them , thinking , ‘ Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts. ’ This was Job ’ s regular custom .
NIVUK	Job	1	6	One day the angels [ a ] came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan [ b ] also came with them .
NIVUK	Job	1	7	The Lord said to Satan , ‘ Where have you come from ? ’ Satan answered the Lord , ‘ From roaming throughout the earth , going to and fro on it. ’
NIVUK	Job	1	8	Then the Lord said to Satan , ‘ Have you considered my servant Job ? There is no one on earth like him ; he is blameless and upright , a man who fears God and shuns evil. ’
NIVUK	Job	1	9	‘ Does Job fear God for nothing ? ’ Satan replied .
NIVUK	Job	1	10	‘ Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has ? You have blessed the work of his hands , so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land .
NIVUK	Job	1	11	But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has , and he will surely curse you to your face. ’
NIVUK	Job	1	12	The Lord said to Satan , ‘ Very well , then , everything he has is in your power , but on the man himself do not lay a finger. ’ Then Satan went out from the presence of the Lord .
NIVUK	Job	1	13	One day when Job ’ s sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the eldest brother ’ s house ,
NIVUK	Job	1	14	a messenger came to Job and said , ‘ The oxen were ploughing and the donkeys were grazing nearby ,
NIVUK	Job	1	15	and the Sabeans attacked and made off with them . They put the servants to the sword , and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you ! ’
NIVUK	Job	1	16	While he was still speaking , another messenger came and said , ‘ The fire of God fell from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants , and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you ! ’
NIVUK	Job	1	17	While he was still speaking , another messenger came and said , ‘ The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and made off with them . They put the servants to the sword , and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you ! ’
NIVUK	Job	1	18	While he was still speaking , yet another messenger came and said , ‘ Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the eldest brother ’ s house ,
NIVUK	Job	1	19	when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house . It collapsed on them and they are dead , and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you ! ’
NIVUK	Job	1	20	At this , Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head . Then he fell to the ground in worship
NIVUK	Job	1	21	and said : ‘ Naked I came from my mother ’ s womb , and naked I shall depart . [ c ] The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away ; may the name of the Lord be praised. ’

NIVUK	Job	2	2	And the Lord said to Satan , ‘ Where have you come from ? ’ Satan answered the Lord , ‘ From roaming throughout the earth , going to and fro on it. ’
NIVUK	Job	2	3	Then the Lord said to Satan , ‘ Have you considered my servant Job ? There is no one on earth like him ; he is blameless and upright , a man who fears God and shuns evil . And he still maintains his integrity , though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason. ’
NIVUK	Job	2	4	‘ Skin for skin ! ’ Satan replied . ‘ A man will give all he has for his own life .
NIVUK	Job	2	5	But now stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones , and he will surely curse you to your face. ’
NIVUK	Job	2	6	The Lord said to Satan , ‘ Very well , then , he is in your hands ; but you must spare his life. ’
NIVUK	Job	2	7	So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head .
NIVUK	Job	2	8	Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes .
NIVUK	Job	2	9	His wife said to him , ‘ Are you still maintaining your integrity ? Curse God and die ! ’
NIVUK	Job	2	10	He replied , ‘ You are talking like a foolish [ b ] woman . Shall we accept good from God , and not trouble ? ’ In all this , Job did not sin in what he said .
NIVUK	Job	2	11	When Job ’ s three friends , Eliphaz the Temanite , Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite , heard about all the troubles that had come upon him , they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathise with him and comfort him .
NIVUK	Job	2	12	When they saw him from a distance , they could hardly recognise him ; they began to weep aloud , and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads .
NIVUK	Job	2	13	Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights . No one said a word to him , because they saw how great his suffering was . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Job	3	3	‘ May the day of my birth perish , and the night that said , “ A boy is conceived ! ”
NIVUK	Job	3	2	He said :
NIVUK	Job	3	4	That day – may it turn to darkness ; may God above not care about it ; may no light shine on it .
NIVUK	Job	3	5	May gloom and utter darkness claim it once more ; may a cloud settle over it ; may blackness overwhelm it .
NIVUK	Job	3	6	That night – may thick darkness seize it ; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months .
NIVUK	Job	3	7	May that night be barren ; may no shout of joy be heard in it .
NIVUK	Job	3	8	May those who curse days [ a ] curse that day , those who are ready to rouse Leviathan .
NIVUK	Job	3	9	May its morning stars become dark ; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn ,
NIVUK	Job	3	10	for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes .
NIVUK	Job	3	11	‘ Why did I not perish at birth , and die as I came from the womb ?
NIVUK	Job	3	12	Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed ?
NIVUK	Job	3	13	For now I would be lying down in peace ; I would be asleep and at rest
NIVUK	Job	3	14	with kings and rulers of the earth , who built for themselves places now lying in ruins ,
NIVUK	Job	3	15	with princes who had gold , who filled their houses with silver .
NIVUK	Job	3	16	Or why was I not hidden away in the ground like a stillborn child , like an infant who never saw the light of day ?
NIVUK	Job	3	17	There the wicked cease from turmoil , and there the weary are at rest .
NIVUK	Job	3	18	Captives also enjoy their ease ; they no longer hear the slave driver ’ s shout .
NIVUK	Job	3	19	The small and the great are there , and the slaves are freed from their owners .
NIVUK	Job	3	20	‘ Why is light given to those in misery , and life to the bitter of soul ,
NIVUK	Job	3	21	to those who long for death that does not come , who search for it more than for hidden treasure ,
NIVUK	Job	3	22	who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave ?
NIVUK	Job	3	23	Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden , whom God has hedged in ?
NIVUK	Job	3	24	For sighing has become my daily food ; my groans pour out like water .
NIVUK	Job	3	25	What I feared has come upon me ; what I dreaded has happened to me .

NIVUK	Job	4	4	Your words have supported those who stumbled ; you have strengthened faltering knees .
NIVUK	Job	4	2	‘ If someone ventures a word with you , will you be impatient ? But who can keep from speaking ?
NIVUK	Job	4	3	Think how you have instructed many , how you have strengthened feeble hands .
NIVUK	Job	4	5	But now trouble comes to you , and you are discouraged ; it strikes you , and you are dismayed .
NIVUK	Job	4	6	Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope ?
NIVUK	Job	4	7	‘ Consider now : who , being innocent , has ever perished ? Where were the upright ever destroyed ?
NIVUK	Job	4	8	As I have observed , those who plough evil and those who sow trouble reap it .
NIVUK	Job	4	9	At the breath of God they perish ; at the blast of his anger they are no more .

NIVUK	Job	4	15	A spirit glided past my face , and the hair on my body stood on end .
NIVUK	Job	4	16	It stopped , but I could not tell what it was . A form stood before my eyes , and I heard a hushed voice :
NIVUK	Job	4	17	“ Can a mortal be more righteous than God ? Can even a strong man be more pure than his Maker ?
NIVUK	Job	4	18	If God places no trust in his servants , if he charges his angels with error ,
NIVUK	Job	4	19	how much more those who live in houses of clay , whose foundations are in the dust , who are crushed more readily than a moth !

NIVUK	Job	5	5	The hungry consume his harvest , taking it even from among thorns , and the thirsty pant after his wealth .
NIVUK	Job	5	2	Resentment kills a fool , and envy slays the simple .
NIVUK	Job	5	3	I myself have seen a fool taking root , but suddenly his house was cursed .
NIVUK	Job	5	4	His children are far from safety , crushed in court without a defender .
NIVUK	Job	5	6	For hardship does not spring from the soil , nor does trouble sprout from the ground .
NIVUK	Job	5	7	Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upwards .
NIVUK	Job	5	8	‘ But if I were you , I would appeal to God ; I would lay my cause before him .
NIVUK	Job	5	9	He performs wonders that can not be fathomed , miracles that can not be counted .
NIVUK	Job	5	10	He provides rain for the earth ; he sends water on the countryside .
NIVUK	Job	5	11	The lowly he sets on high , and those who mourn are lifted to safety .
NIVUK	Job	5	12	He thwarts the plans of the crafty , so that their hands achieve no success .
NIVUK	Job	5	13	He catches the wise in their craftiness , and the schemes of the wily are swept away .
NIVUK	Job	5	14	Darkness comes upon them in the daytime ; at noon they grope as in the night .
NIVUK	Job	5	15	He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth ; he saves them from the clutches of the powerful .
NIVUK	Job	5	16	So the poor have hope , and injustice shuts its mouth .
NIVUK	Job	5	17	‘ Blessed is the one whom God corrects ; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty . [ a ]

NIVUK	Job	5	19	From six calamities he will rescue you ; in seven no harm will touch you .
NIVUK	Job	5	20	In famine he will deliver you from death , and in battle from the stroke of the sword .
NIVUK	Job	5	21	You will be protected from the lash of the tongue , and need not fear when destruction comes .
NIVUK	Job	5	22	You will laugh at destruction and famine , and need not fear the wild animals .

NIVUK	Job	6	6	Is tasteless food eaten without salt , or is there flavour in the sap of the mallow [ a ] ?
NIVUK	Job	6	2	‘ If only my anguish could be weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales !
NIVUK	Job	6	3	It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas – no wonder my words have been impetuous .
NIVUK	Job	6	4	The arrows of the Almighty are in me , my spirit drinks in their poison ; God ’ s terrors are marshalled against me .
NIVUK	Job	6	5	Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass , or an ox bellow when it has fodder ?
NIVUK	Job	6	7	I refuse to touch it ; such food makes me ill.
NIVUK	Job	6	8	‘ Oh , that I might have my request , that God would grant what I hope for ,
NIVUK	Job	6	9	that God would be willing to crush me , to let loose his hand and cut off my life !
NIVUK	Job	6	10	Then I would still have this consolation – my joy in unrelenting pain – that I had not denied the words of the Holy One .
NIVUK	Job	6	11	‘ What strength do I have , that I should still hope ? What prospects , that I should be patient ?
NIVUK	Job	6	12	Do I have the strength of stone ? Is my flesh bronze ?
NIVUK	Job	6	13	Do I have any power to help myself , now that success has been driven from me ?
NIVUK	Job	6	14	‘ Anyone who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty .
NIVUK	Job	6	15	But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams , as the streams that overflow
NIVUK	Job	6	16	when darkened by thawing ice and swollen with melting snow ,
NIVUK	Job	6	17	but that stop flowing in the dry season , and in the heat vanish from their channels .
NIVUK	Job	6	18	Caravans turn aside from their routes ; they go off into the wasteland and perish .
NIVUK	Job	6	19	The caravans of Tema look for water , the travelling merchants of Sheba look in hope .
NIVUK	Job	6	20	They are distressed , because they had been confident ; they arrive there , only to be disappointed .
NIVUK	Job	6	21	Now you too have proved to be of no help ; you see something dreadful and are afraid .
NIVUK	Job	6	22	Have I ever said , “ Give something on my behalf , pay a ransom for me from your wealth ,
NIVUK	Job	6	23	deliver me from the hand of the enemy , rescue me from the clutches of the ruthless ” ?
NIVUK	Job	6	24	‘ Teach me , and I will be quiet ; show me where I have been wrong .
NIVUK	Job	6	25	How painful are honest words ! But what do your arguments prove ?
NIVUK	Job	6	26	Do you mean to correct what I say , and treat my desperate words as wind ?
NIVUK	Job	6	27	You would even cast lots for the fatherless and barter away your friend .

NIVUK	Job	7	8	The eye that now sees me will see me no longer ; you will look for me , but I will be no more .

NIVUK	Job	7	14	even then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions ,
NIVUK	Job	7	15	so that I prefer strangling and death , rather than this body of mine .
NIVUK	Job	7	16	I despise my life ; I would not live for ever . Let me alone ; my days have no meaning .

NIVUK	Job	8	17	it entwines its roots round a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones .
NIVUK	Job	8	18	But when it is torn from its spot , that place disowns it and says , “ I never saw you. ”
NIVUK	Job	8	19	Surely its life withers away , and [ b ] from the soil other plants grow .

NIVUK	Job	9	4	His wisdom is profound , his power is vast . Who has resisted him and come out unscathed ?

NIVUK	Job	9	19	If it is a matter of strength , he is mighty ! And if it is a matter of justice , who can challenge him [ b ] ?
NIVUK	Job	9	20	Even if I were innocent , my mouth would condemn me ; if I were blameless , it would pronounce me guilty .

NIVUK	Job	20	2	‘ My troubled thoughts prompt me to answer because I am greatly disturbed .
NIVUK	Job	20	3	I hear a rebuke that dishonours me , and my understanding inspires me to reply .
NIVUK	Job	20	4	‘ Surely you know how it has been from of old , ever since mankind [ a ] was placed on the earth ,
NIVUK	Job	20	5	that the mirth of the wicked is brief , the joy of the godless lasts but a moment .
NIVUK	Job	20	6	Though the pride of the godless person reaches to the heavens and his head touches the clouds ,
NIVUK	Job	20	7	he will perish for ever , like his own dung ; those who have seen him will say , “ Where is he ? ”
NIVUK	Job	20	8	Like a dream he flies away , no more to be found , banished like a vision of the night .
NIVUK	Job	20	9	The eye that saw him will not see him again ; his place will look on him no more .
NIVUK	Job	20	10	His children must make amends to the poor ; his own hands must give back his wealth .
NIVUK	Job	20	11	The youthful vigour that fills his bones will lie with him in the dust .
NIVUK	Job	20	12	‘ Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he hides it under his tongue ,
NIVUK	Job	20	13	though he can not bear to let it go and lets it linger in his mouth ,
NIVUK	Job	20	14	yet his food will turn sour in his stomach ; it will become the venom of serpents within him .
NIVUK	Job	20	15	He will spit out the riches he swallowed ; God will make his stomach vomit them up .
NIVUK	Job	20	16	He will suck the poison of serpents ; the fangs of an adder will kill him .
NIVUK	Job	20	17	He will not enjoy the streams , the rivers flowing with honey and cream .
NIVUK	Job	20	18	What he toiled for he must give back uneaten ; he will not enjoy the profit from his trading .
NIVUK	Job	20	19	For he has oppressed the poor and left them destitute ; he has seized houses he did not build .

NIVUK	Job	20	24	Though he flees from an iron weapon , a bronze-tipped arrow pierces him .
NIVUK	Job	20	25	He pulls it out of his back , the gleaming point out of his liver . Terrors will come over him ;

NIVUK	Job	21	21	For what do they care about the families they leave behind when their allotted months come to an end ?
NIVUK	Job	21	2	‘ Listen carefully to my words ; let this be the consolation you give me .
NIVUK	Job	21	3	Bear with me while I speak , and after I have spoken , mock on .
NIVUK	Job	21	4	‘ Is my complaint directed to a human being ? Why should I not be impatient ?
NIVUK	Job	21	5	Look at me and be appalled ; clap your hand over your mouth .
NIVUK	Job	21	6	When I think about this , I am terrified ; trembling seizes my body .
NIVUK	Job	21	7	Why do the wicked live on , growing old and increasing in power ?
NIVUK	Job	21	8	They see their children established around them , their offspring before their eyes .
NIVUK	Job	21	9	Their homes are safe and free from fear ; the rod of God is not on them .
NIVUK	Job	21	10	Their bulls never fail to breed ; their cows calve and do not miscarry .
NIVUK	Job	21	11	They send forth their children as a flock ; their little ones dance about .
NIVUK	Job	21	12	They sing to the music of tambourine and lyre ; they make merry to the sound of the pipe .
NIVUK	Job	21	13	They spend their years in prosperity and go down to the grave in peace . [ a ]
NIVUK	Job	21	14	Yet they say to God , “ Leave us alone ! We have no desire to know your ways .
NIVUK	Job	21	15	Who is the Almighty , that we should serve him ? What would we gain by praying to him ? ”
NIVUK	Job	21	16	But their prosperity is not in their own hands , so I stand aloof from the plans of the wicked .
NIVUK	Job	21	17	‘ Yet how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out ? How often does calamity come upon them , the fate God allots in his anger ?
NIVUK	Job	21	18	How often are they like straw before the wind , like chaff swept away by a gale ?
NIVUK	Job	21	19	It is said , “ God stores up the punishment of the wicked for their children. ” Let him repay the wicked , so that they themselves will experience it !
NIVUK	Job	21	20	Let their own eyes see their destruction ; let them drink the cup of the wrath of the Almighty .
NIVUK	Job	21	22	‘ Can anyone teach knowledge to God , since he judges even the highest ?
NIVUK	Job	21	23	One person dies in full vigour , completely secure and at ease ,
NIVUK	Job	21	24	well nourished in body , [ b ] bones rich with marrow .
NIVUK	Job	21	25	Another dies in bitterness of soul , never having enjoyed anything good .
NIVUK	Job	21	26	Side by side they lie in the dust , and worms cover them both .
NIVUK	Job	21	27	‘ I know full well what you are thinking , the schemes by which you would wrong me .
NIVUK	Job	21	28	You say , “ Where now is the house of the great , the tents where the wicked lived ? ”
NIVUK	Job	21	29	Have you never questioned those who travel ? Have you paid no regard to their accounts –
NIVUK	Job	21	30	that the wicked are spared from the day of calamity , that they are delivered from [ c ] the day of wrath ?
NIVUK	Job	21	31	Who denounces their conduct to their face ? Who repays them for what they have done ?
NIVUK	Job	21	32	They are carried to the grave , and watch is kept over their tombs .
NIVUK	Job	21	33	The soil in the valley is sweet to them ; everyone follows after them , and a countless throng goes [ d ] before them .

NIVUK	Job	22	2	‘ Can a man be of benefit to God ? Can even a wise person benefit him ?
NIVUK	Job	22	3	What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous ? What would he gain if your ways were blameless ?
NIVUK	Job	22	4	‘ Is it for your piety that he rebukes you and brings charges against you ?
NIVUK	Job	22	5	Is not your wickedness great ? Are not your sins endless ?
NIVUK	Job	22	6	You demanded security from your relatives for no reason ; you stripped people of their clothing , leaving them naked .
NIVUK	Job	22	7	You gave no water to the weary and you withheld food from the hungry ,
NIVUK	Job	22	8	though you were a powerful man , owning land – an honoured man , living on it .
NIVUK	Job	22	9	And you sent widows away empty-handed and broke the strength of the fatherless .

NIVUK	Job	22	15	Will you keep to the old path that the wicked have trod ?
NIVUK	Job	22	16	They were carried off before their time , their foundations washed away by a flood .
NIVUK	Job	22	17	They said to God , “ Leave us alone ! What can the Almighty do to us ? ”
NIVUK	Job	22	18	Yet it was he who filled their houses with good things , so I stand aloof from the plans of the wicked .
NIVUK	Job	22	19	The righteous see their ruin and rejoice ; the innocent mock them , saying ,
NIVUK	Job	22	20	“ Surely our foes are destroyed , and fire devours their wealth. ”
NIVUK	Job	22	21	‘ Submit to God and be at peace with him ; in this way prosperity will come to you .
NIVUK	Job	22	23	If you return to the Almighty , you will be restored : if you remove wickedness far from your tent

NIVUK	Job	23	23	Then Job replied :
NIVUK	Job	23	2	‘ Even today my complaint is bitter ; his hand [ a ] is heavy in spite of [ b ] my groaning .
NIVUK	Job	23	3	If only I knew where to find him ; if only I could go to his dwelling !
NIVUK	Job	23	4	I would state my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments .
NIVUK	Job	23	5	I would find out what he would answer me , and consider what he would say to me .
NIVUK	Job	23	6	Would he vigorously oppose me with great power ? No , he would not press charges against me .
NIVUK	Job	23	7	There the upright can establish their innocence before him , and there I would be delivered for ever from my judge .
NIVUK	Job	23	8	‘ But if I go to the east , he is not there ; if I go to the west , I do not find him .
NIVUK	Job	23	9	When he is at work in the north , I do not see him ; when he turns to the south , I catch no glimpse of him .
NIVUK	Job	23	10	But he knows the way that I take ; when he has tested me , I shall come forth as gold .
NIVUK	Job	23	11	My feet have closely followed his steps ; I have kept to his way without turning aside .

NIVUK	Job	24	24	For a little while they are exalted , and then they are gone ; they are brought low and gathered up like all others ; they are cut off like ears of corn .
NIVUK	Job	24	2	There are those who move boundary stones ; they pasture flocks they have stolen .
NIVUK	Job	24	3	They drive away the orphan ’ s donkey and take the widow ’ s ox in pledge .
NIVUK	Job	24	4	They thrust the needy from the path and force all the poor of the land into hiding .
NIVUK	Job	24	5	Like wild donkeys in the desert , the poor go about their labour of foraging food ; the wasteland provides food for their children .
NIVUK	Job	24	6	They gather fodder in the fields and glean in the vineyards of the wicked .

NIVUK	Job	24	11	They crush olives among the terraces [ a ] ; they tread the winepresses , yet suffer thirst .
NIVUK	Job	24	12	The groans of the dying rise from the city , and the souls of the wounded cry out for help . But God charges no one with wrongdoing .
NIVUK	Job	24	13	‘ There are those who rebel against the light , who do not know its ways or stay in its paths .
NIVUK	Job	24	14	When daylight is gone , the murderer rises up , kills the poor and needy , and in the night steals forth like a thief .
NIVUK	Job	24	15	The eye of the adulterer watches for dusk ; he thinks , “ No eye will see me , ” and he keeps his face concealed .
NIVUK	Job	24	16	In the dark , thieves break into houses , but by day they shut themselves in ; they want nothing to do with the light .
NIVUK	Job	24	17	For all of them , midnight is their morning ; they make friends with the terrors of darkness .
NIVUK	Job	24	18	‘ Yet they are foam on the surface of the water ; their portion of the land is cursed , so that no one goes to the vineyards .
NIVUK	Job	24	19	As heat and drought snatch away the melted snow , so the grave snatches away those who have sinned .
NIVUK	Job	24	20	The womb forgets them , the worm feasts on them ; the wicked are no longer remembered but are broken like a tree .
NIVUK	Job	24	21	They prey on the barren and childless woman , and to the widow they show no kindness .
NIVUK	Job	24	22	But God drags away the mighty by his power ; though they become established , they have no assurance of life .

NIVUK	Job	30	30	My skin grows black and peels ; my body burns with fever .
NIVUK	Job	30	2	Of what use was the strength of their hands to me , since their vigour had gone from them ?
NIVUK	Job	30	3	Haggard from want and hunger , they roamed [ a ] the parched land in desolate wastelands at night .
NIVUK	Job	30	4	In the brush they gathered salt herbs , and their food [ b ] was the root of the broom bush .
NIVUK	Job	30	5	They were banished from human society , shouted at as if they were thieves .
NIVUK	Job	30	6	They were forced to live in the dry stream beds , among the rocks and in holes in the ground .
NIVUK	Job	30	7	They brayed among the bushes and huddled in the undergrowth .
NIVUK	Job	30	8	A base and nameless brood , they were driven out of the land .
NIVUK	Job	30	9	‘ And now those young men mock me in song ; I have become a byword among them .
NIVUK	Job	30	10	They detest me and keep their distance ; they do not hesitate to spit in my face .
NIVUK	Job	30	11	Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me , they throw off restraint in my presence .
NIVUK	Job	30	12	On my right the tribe [ c ] attacks ; they lay snares for my feet , they build their siege ramps against me .
NIVUK	Job	30	13	They break up my road ; they succeed in destroying me . “ No one can help him , ” they say .
NIVUK	Job	30	14	They advance as through a gaping breach ; amid the ruins they come rolling in .
NIVUK	Job	30	15	Terrors overwhelm me ; my dignity is driven away as by the wind , my safety vanishes like a cloud .
NIVUK	Job	30	16	‘ And now my life ebbs away ; days of suffering grip me .
NIVUK	Job	30	17	Night pierces my bones ; my gnawing pains never rest .
NIVUK	Job	30	18	In his great power God becomes like clothing to me [ d ] ; he binds me like the neck of my garment .
NIVUK	Job	30	19	He throws me into the mud , and I am reduced to dust and ashes .
NIVUK	Job	30	20	‘ I cry out to you , God , but you do not answer ; I stand up , but you merely look at me .
NIVUK	Job	30	21	You turn on me ruthlessly ; with the might of your hand you attack me .
NIVUK	Job	30	22	You snatch me up and drive me before the wind ; you toss me about in the storm .
NIVUK	Job	30	23	I know you will bring me down to death , to the place appointed for all the living .
NIVUK	Job	30	24	‘ Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man when he cries for help in his distress .
NIVUK	Job	30	25	Have I not wept for those in trouble ? Has not my soul grieved for the poor ?
NIVUK	Job	30	26	Yet when I hoped for good , evil came ; when I looked for light , then came darkness .
NIVUK	Job	30	27	The churning inside me never stops ; days of suffering confront me .
NIVUK	Job	30	28	I go about blackened , but not by the sun ; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help .

NIVUK	Job	31	31	if those of my household have never said , “ Who has not been filled with Job ’ s meat ? ” –
NIVUK	Job	31	2	For what is our lot from God above , our heritage from the Almighty on high ?
NIVUK	Job	31	3	Is it not ruin for the wicked , disaster for those who do wrong ?
NIVUK	Job	31	4	Does he not see my ways and count my every step ?
NIVUK	Job	31	5	‘ If I have walked with falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit –
NIVUK	Job	31	6	let God weigh me in honest scales and he will know that I am blameless –
NIVUK	Job	31	7	if my steps have turned from the path , if my heart has been led by my eyes , or if my hands have been defiled ,
NIVUK	Job	31	8	then may others eat what I have sown , and may my crops be uprooted .
NIVUK	Job	31	9	‘ If my heart has been enticed by a woman , or if I have lurked at my neighbour ’ s door ,
NIVUK	Job	31	10	then may my wife grind another man ’ s grain , and may other men sleep with her .
NIVUK	Job	31	11	For that would have been wicked , a sin to be judged .
NIVUK	Job	31	12	It is a fire that burns to Destruction ; [ a ] it would have uprooted my harvest .
NIVUK	Job	31	13	‘ If I have denied justice to any of my servants , whether male or female , when they had a grievance against me ,
NIVUK	Job	31	14	what will I do when God confronts me ? What will I answer when called to account ?
NIVUK	Job	31	15	Did not he who made me in the womb make them ? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers ?
NIVUK	Job	31	16	‘ If I have denied the desires of the poor or let the eyes of the widow grow weary ,
NIVUK	Job	31	17	if I have kept my bread to myself , not sharing it with the fatherless –
NIVUK	Job	31	18	but from my youth I reared them as a father would , and from my birth I guided the widow –
NIVUK	Job	31	19	if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing , or the needy without garments ,
NIVUK	Job	31	20	and their hearts did not bless me for warming them with the fleece from my sheep ,
NIVUK	Job	31	21	if I have raised my hand against the fatherless , knowing that I had influence in court ,
NIVUK	Job	31	22	then let my arm fall from the shoulder , let it be broken off at the joint .
NIVUK	Job	31	23	For I dreaded destruction from God , and for fear of his splendour I could not do such things .
NIVUK	Job	31	24	‘ If I have put my trust in gold or said to pure gold , “ You are my security , ”
NIVUK	Job	31	25	if I have rejoiced over my great wealth , the fortune my hands had gained ,
NIVUK	Job	31	26	if I have regarded the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendour ,
NIVUK	Job	31	27	so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand offered them a kiss of homage ,
NIVUK	Job	31	28	then these also would be sins to be judged , for I would have been unfaithful to God on high .
NIVUK	Job	31	29	‘ If I have rejoiced at my enemy ’ s misfortune or gloated over the trouble that came to him –
NIVUK	Job	31	30	I have not allowed my mouth to sin by invoking a curse against their life –
NIVUK	Job	31	32	but no stranger had to spend the night in the street , for my door was always open to the traveller –
NIVUK	Job	31	33	if I have concealed my sin as people do , [ b ] by hiding my guilt in my heart
NIVUK	Job	31	34	because I so feared the crowd and so dreaded the contempt of the clans that I kept silent and would not go outside –
NIVUK	Job	31	35	( ‘ Oh , that I had someone to hear me ! I sign now my defence – let the Almighty answer me ; let my accuser put his indictment in writing .
NIVUK	Job	31	36	Surely I would wear it on my shoulder , I would put it on like a crown .

NIVUK	Job	32	32	So these three men stopped answering Job , because he was righteous in his own eyes .
NIVUK	Job	32	2	But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite , of the family of Ram , became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God .
NIVUK	Job	32	3	He was also angry with the three friends , because they had found no way to refute Job , and yet had condemned him . [ a ]
NIVUK	Job	32	4	Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he .
NIVUK	Job	32	5	But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say , his anger was aroused .
NIVUK	Job	32	6	So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said : ‘ I am young in years , and you are old ; that is why I was fearful , not daring to tell you what I know .
NIVUK	Job	32	7	I thought , “ Age should speak ; advanced years should teach wisdom. ”
NIVUK	Job	32	8	But it is the spirit [ b ] in a person , the breath of the Almighty , that gives them understanding .
NIVUK	Job	32	9	It is not only the old [ c ] who are wise , not only the aged who understand what is right .
NIVUK	Job	32	10	‘ Therefore I say : listen to me ; I too will tell you what I know .
NIVUK	Job	32	11	I waited while you spoke , I listened to your reasoning ; while you were searching for words ,
NIVUK	Job	32	12	I gave you my full attention . But not one of you has proved Job wrong ; none of you has answered his arguments .
NIVUK	Job	32	13	Do not say , “ We have found wisdom ; let God , not a man , refute him. ”
NIVUK	Job	32	14	But Job has not marshalled his words against me , and I will not answer him with your arguments .
NIVUK	Job	32	15	‘ They are dismayed and have no more to say ; words have failed them .
NIVUK	Job	32	16	Must I wait , now that they are silent , now that they stand there with no reply ?
NIVUK	Job	32	17	I too will have my say ; I too will tell what I know .
NIVUK	Job	32	18	For I am full of words , and the spirit within me compels me ;
NIVUK	Job	32	19	inside I am like bottled-up wine , like new wineskins ready to burst .
NIVUK	Job	32	20	I must speak and find relief ; I must open my lips and reply .
NIVUK	Job	32	21	I will show no partiality , nor will I flatter anyone ;

NIVUK	Job	33	2	I am about to open my mouth ; my words are on the tip of my tongue .
NIVUK	Job	33	3	My words come from an upright heart ; my lips sincerely speak what I know .
NIVUK	Job	33	4	The Spirit of God has made me ; the breath of the Almighty gives me life .
NIVUK	Job	33	5	Answer me then , if you can ; stand up and argue your case before me .
NIVUK	Job	33	6	I am the same as you ; in God ’ s sight ; I too am a piece of clay .
NIVUK	Job	33	7	No fear of me should alarm you , nor should my hand be heavy on you .
NIVUK	Job	33	8	‘ But you have said in my hearing – I heard the very words –
NIVUK	Job	33	9	“ I am pure , I have done no wrong ; I am clean and free from sin .
NIVUK	Job	33	10	Yet God has found fault with me ; he considers me his enemy .
NIVUK	Job	33	11	He fastens my feet in shackles ; he keeps close watch on all my paths. ”
NIVUK	Job	33	12	‘ But I tell you , in this you are not right , for God is greater than any mortal .
NIVUK	Job	33	13	Why do you complain to him that he responds to no one ’ s words [ a ] ?
NIVUK	Job	33	14	For God does speak – now one way , now another – though no one perceives it .
NIVUK	Job	33	15	In a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sleep falls on people as they slumber in their beds ,
NIVUK	Job	33	16	he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings ,
NIVUK	Job	33	17	to turn them from wrongdoing and keep them from pride ,
NIVUK	Job	33	18	to preserve them from the pit , their lives from perishing by the sword . [ b ]
NIVUK	Job	33	19	‘ Or someone may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in their bones ,
NIVUK	Job	33	20	so that their body finds food repulsive and their soul loathes the choicest meal .
NIVUK	Job	33	21	Their flesh wastes away to nothing , and their bones , once hidden , now stick out .
NIVUK	Job	33	22	They draw near to the pit , and their life to the messengers of death . [ c ]
NIVUK	Job	33	23	Yet if there is an angel at their side , a messenger , one out of a thousand , sent to tell them how to be upright ,
NIVUK	Job	33	24	and he is gracious to that person and says to God , “ Spare them from going down to the pit ; I have found a ransom for them –
NIVUK	Job	33	25	let their flesh be renewed like a child ’ s ; let them be restored as in the days of their youth ” –
NIVUK	Job	33	26	then that person can pray to God and find favour with him , they will see God ’ s face and shout for joy ; he will restore them to full well-being .
NIVUK	Job	33	27	And they will go to others and say , “ I have sinned , and I have perverted what is right , but I did not get what I deserved .
NIVUK	Job	33	28	God has delivered me from going down to the pit , and I shall live to enjoy the light of life. ”
NIVUK	Job	33	29	‘ God does all these things to a person – twice , even three times –
NIVUK	Job	33	30	to turn them back from the pit , that the light of life may shine on them .

NIVUK	Job	34	5	‘ Job says , “ I am innocent , but God denies me justice .
NIVUK	Job	34	6	Although I am right , I am considered a liar ; although I am guiltless , his arrow inflicts an incurable wound. ”
NIVUK	Job	34	7	Is there anyone like Job , who drinks scorn like water ?
NIVUK	Job	34	8	He keeps company with evildoers ; he associates with the wicked .
NIVUK	Job	34	9	For he says , “ There is no profit in trying to please God. ”
NIVUK	Job	34	10	‘ So listen to me , you men of understanding . Far be it from God to do evil , from the Almighty to do wrong .
NIVUK	Job	34	11	He repays everyone for what they have done ; he brings on them what their conduct deserves .
NIVUK	Job	34	12	It is unthinkable that God would do wrong , that the Almighty would pervert justice .

NIVUK	Job	34	14	If it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit [ a ] and breath ,

NIVUK	Job	34	18	Is he not the One who says to kings , “ You are worthless , ” and to nobles , “ You are wicked , ”
NIVUK	Job	34	19	who shows no partiality to princes and does not favour the rich over the poor , for they are all the work of his hands ?
NIVUK	Job	34	20	They die in an instant , in the middle of the night ; the people are shaken and they pass away ; the mighty are removed without human hand .
NIVUK	Job	34	21	‘ His eyes are on the ways of mortals ; he sees their every step .
NIVUK	Job	34	22	There is no deep shadow , no utter darkness , where evildoers can hide .
NIVUK	Job	34	23	God has no need to examine men further , that they should come before him for judgment .
NIVUK	Job	34	24	Without enquiry he shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place .
NIVUK	Job	34	25	Because he takes note of their deeds , he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed .
NIVUK	Job	34	26	He punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them ,
NIVUK	Job	34	27	because they turned from following him and had no regard for any of his ways .
NIVUK	Job	34	28	They caused the cry of the poor to come before him , so that he heard the cry of the needy .
NIVUK	Job	34	29	But if he remains silent , who can condemn him ? If he hides his face , who can see him ? Yet he is over individual and nation alike ,
NIVUK	Job	34	30	to keep the godless from ruling , from laying snares for the people .
NIVUK	Job	34	31	‘ Suppose someone says to God , “ I am guilty but will offend no more .
NIVUK	Job	34	32	Teach me what I can not see ; if I have done wrong , I will not do so again. ”
NIVUK	Job	34	33	Should God then reward you on your terms , when you refuse to repent ? You must decide , not I ; so tell me what you know .
NIVUK	Job	34	35	“ Job speaks without knowledge ; his words lack insight. ”
NIVUK	Job	34	36	Oh , that Job might be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man !

NIVUK	Job	35	13	Indeed , God does not listen to their empty plea ; the Almighty pays no attention to it .
NIVUK	Job	35	14	How much less , then , will he listen when you say that you do not see him , that your case is before him and you must wait for him ,

NIVUK	Job	40	40	The Lord said to Job :

NIVUK	Job	41	28	Arrows do not make it flee ; slingstones are like chaff to it .
NIVUK	Job	41	29	A club seems to it but a piece of straw ; it laughs at the rattling of the lance .

NIVUK	Job	42	42	Then Job replied to the Lord :
NIVUK	Job	42	2	‘ I know that you can do all things ; no purpose of yours can be thwarted .
NIVUK	Job	42	3	You asked , “ Who is this that obscures my plans without knowledge ? ” Surely I spoke of things I did not understand , things too wonderful for me to know .
NIVUK	Job	42	4	‘ You said , “ Listen now , and I will speak ; I will question you , and you shall answer me. ”
NIVUK	Job	42	5	My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you .
NIVUK	Job	42	6	Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes. ’ Epilogue
NIVUK	Job	42	7	After the Lord had said these things to Job , he said to Eliphaz the Temanite , ‘ I am angry with you and your two friends , because you have not spoken the truth about me , as my servant Job has .
NIVUK	Job	42	8	So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves .

NIVUK	Job	42	9	So Eliphaz the Temanite , Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the Lord told them ; and the Lord accepted Job ’ s prayer .
NIVUK	Job	42	10	After Job had prayed for his friends , the Lord restored his fortunes and gave him twice as much as he had before .
NIVUK	Job	42	11	All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house . They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the Lord had brought on him , and each one gave him a piece of silver [ a ] and a gold ring .
NIVUK	Job	42	12	The Lord blessed the latter part of Job ’ s life more than the former part . He had fourteen thousand sheep , six thousand camels , a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys .
NIVUK	Job	42	13	And he also had seven sons and three daughters .
NIVUK	Job	42	14	The first daughter he named Jemimah , the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch .
NIVUK	Job	42	15	Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job ’ s daughters , and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers .
NIVUK	Job	42	16	After this , Job lived a hundred and forty years ; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation .
NIVUK	Job	42	17	And so Job died , an old man and full of years . Footnotes - Job 42:11 Hebrew him a kesitah ; a kesitah was a unit of money of unknown weight and value . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Psalms	69	3	I am worn out calling for help ; my throat is parched . My eyes fail , looking for my God .
NIVUK	Psalms	69	4	Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head ; many are my enemies without cause , those who seek to destroy me . I am forced to restore what I did not steal .

NIVUK	Psalms	69	21	They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst .

NIVUK	Psalms	73	89	Psalm
NIVUK	Psalms	73	1	Surely God is good to Israel , to those who are pure in heart .
NIVUK	Psalms	73	2	But as for me , my feet had almost slipped ; I had nearly lost my foothold .
NIVUK	Psalms	73	3	For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked .
NIVUK	Psalms	73	4	They have no struggles ; their bodies are healthy and strong . [ a ]
NIVUK	Psalms	73	5	They are free from common human burdens ; they are not plagued by human ills .
NIVUK	Psalms	73	6	Therefore pride is their necklace ; they clothe themselves with violence .
NIVUK	Psalms	73	7	From their callous hearts comes iniquity ; [ b ] their evil imaginations have no limits .
NIVUK	Psalms	73	8	They scoff , and speak with malice ; with arrogance they threaten oppression .
NIVUK	Psalms	73	9	Their mouths lay claim to heaven , and their tongues take possession of the earth .
NIVUK	Psalms	73	10	Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance . [ c ]

NIVUK	Psalms	73	19	How suddenly are they destroyed , completely swept away by terrors !
NIVUK	Psalms	73	20	They are like a dream when one awakes ; when you arise , Lord , you will despise them as fantasies .
NIVUK	Psalms	73	21	When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered ,
NIVUK	Psalms	73	22	I was senseless and ignorant ; I was a brute beast before you .
NIVUK	Psalms	73	23	Yet I am always with you ; you hold me by my right hand .
NIVUK	Psalms	73	24	You guide me with your counsel , and afterwards you will take me into glory .

NIVUK	Psalms	77	4	You kept my eyes from closing ; I was too troubled to speak .
NIVUK	Psalms	77	5	I thought about the former days , the years of long ago ;

NIVUK	Psalms	77	7	‘ Will the Lord reject for ever ? Will he never show his favour again ?

NIVUK	Psalms	78	78	A maskil [ a ] of Asaph .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	1	My people , hear my teaching ; listen to the words of my mouth .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	2	I will open my mouth with a parable ; I will utter hidden things , things from of old –
NIVUK	Psalms	78	3	things we have heard and known , things our ancestors have told us .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	4	We will not hide them from their descendants ; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the Lord , his power , and the wonders he has done .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	5	He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel , which he commanded our ancestors to teach their children ,
NIVUK	Psalms	78	6	so that the next generation would know them , even the children yet to be born , and they in turn would tell their children .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	7	Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	8	They would not be like their ancestors – a stubborn and rebellious generation , whose hearts were not loyal to God , whose spirits were not faithful to him .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	9	The men of Ephraim , though armed with bows , turned back on the day of battle ;
NIVUK	Psalms	78	10	they did not keep God ’ s covenant and refused to live by his law .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	11	They forgot what he had done , the wonders he had shown them .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	12	He did miracles in the sight of their ancestors in the land of Egypt , in the region of Zoan .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	13	He divided the sea and led them through ; he made the water stand up like a wall .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	14	He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	15	He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them water as abundant as the seas ;
NIVUK	Psalms	78	16	he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	17	But they continued to sin against him , rebelling in the wilderness against the Most High .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	18	They wilfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	19	They spoke against God ; they said , ‘ Can God really spread a table in the wilderness ?
NIVUK	Psalms	78	20	True , he struck the rock , and water gushed out , streams flowed abundantly , but can he also give us bread ? Can he supply meat for his people ? ’
NIVUK	Psalms	78	21	When the Lord heard them , he was furious ; his fire broke out against Jacob , and his wrath rose against Israel ,
NIVUK	Psalms	78	22	for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	23	Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens ;
NIVUK	Psalms	78	24	he rained down manna for the people to eat , he gave them the grain of heaven .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	25	Human beings ate the bread of angels ; he sent them all the food they could eat .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	26	He let loose the east wind from the heavens and by his power made the south wind blow .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	27	He rained meat down on them like dust , birds like sand on the seashore .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	28	He made them come down inside their camp , all around their tents .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	29	They ate till they were gorged – he had given them what they craved .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	30	But before they turned from what they craved , even while the food was still in their mouths ,
NIVUK	Psalms	78	31	God ’ s anger rose against them ; he put to death the sturdiest among them , cutting down the young men of Israel .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	32	In spite of all this , they kept on sinning ; in spite of his wonders , they did not believe .
NIVUK	Psalms	78	33	So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror .

NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	2	2	‘ Laughter , ’ I said , ‘ is madness . And what does pleasure accomplish ? ’
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	2	3	I tried cheering myself with wine , and embracing folly – my mind still guiding me with wisdom . I wanted to see what was good for people to do under the heavens during the few days of their lives .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	2	4	I undertook great projects : I built houses for myself and planted vineyards .

NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	2	12	Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom , and also madness and folly . What more can the king ’ s successor do than what has already been done ?
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	2	13	I saw that wisdom is better than folly , just as light is better than darkness .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	2	14	The wise have eyes in their heads , while the fool walks in the darkness ; but I came to realise that the same fate overtakes them both .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	2	15	Then I said to myself , ‘ The fate of the fool will overtake me also . What then do I gain by being wise ? ’ I said to myself , ‘ This too is meaningless. ’
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	2	16	For the wise , like the fool , will not be long remembered ; the days have already come when both have been forgotten . Like the fool , the wise too must die ! Toil is meaningless

NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	2	18	I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun , because I must leave them to the one who comes after me .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	2	19	And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish ? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun . This too is meaningless .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	2	20	So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labour under the sun .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	2	21	For a person may labour with wisdom , knowledge and skill , and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it . This too is meaningless and a great misfortune .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	2	22	What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labour under the sun ?
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	2	23	All their days their work is grief and pain ; even at night their minds do not rest . This too is meaningless .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	2	24	A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil . This too , I see , is from the hand of God ,
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	2	25	for without him , who can eat or find enjoyment ?
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	2	26	To the person who pleases him , God gives wisdom , knowledge and happiness , but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God . This too is meaningless , a chasing after the wind . Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 2:8 The meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain .

NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	3	9	What do workers gain from their toil ?
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	3	10	I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	3	11	He has made everything beautiful in its time . He has also set eternity in the human heart ; yet [ a ] no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	3	12	I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	3	13	That each of them may eat and drink , and find satisfaction in all their toil – this is the gift of God .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	3	14	I know that everything God does will endure for ever ; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it . God does it so that people will fear him .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	3	15	Whatever is has already been , and what will be has been before ; and God will call the past to account . [ b ]
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	3	16	And I saw something else under the sun : in the place of judgment – wickedness was there , in the place of justice – wickedness was there .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	3	17	I said to myself , ‘ God will bring into judgment both the righteous and the wicked , for there will be a time for every activity , a time to judge every deed. ’
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	3	18	I also said to myself , ‘ As for humans , God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	3	19	Surely the fate of human beings is like that of the animals ; the same fate awaits them both : as one dies , so dies the other . All have the same breath [ c ] ; humans have no advantage over animals . Everything is meaningless .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	3	20	All go to the same place ; all come from dust , and to dust all return .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	3	21	Who knows if the human spirit rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth ? ’
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	3	22	So I saw that there is nothing better for a person than to enjoy their work , because that is their lot . For who can bring them to see what will happen after them ?

NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	4	4	And I saw that all toil and all achievement spring from one person ’ s envy of another . This too is meaningless , a chasing after the wind .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	4	2	And I declared that the dead , who had already died , are happier than the living , who are still alive .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	4	3	But better than both is the one who has never been born , who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	4	5	Fools fold their hands and ruin themselves .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	4	6	Better one handful with tranquillity than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	4	7	Again I saw something meaningless under the sun :
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	4	8	there was a man all alone ; he had neither son nor brother . There was no end to his toil , yet his eyes were not content with his wealth . ‘ For whom am I toiling , ’ he asked , ‘ and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment ? ’ This too is meaningless – a miserable business !
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	4	9	Two are better than one , because they have a good return for their labour :
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	4	10	if either of them falls down , one can help the other up . But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	4	11	Also , if two lie down together , they will keep warm . But how can one keep warm alone ?
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	4	12	Though one may be overpowered , two can defend themselves . A cord of three strands is not quickly broken . Advancement is meaningless
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	4	13	Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to heed a warning .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	4	14	The youth may have come from prison to the kingship , or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	4	15	I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed the youth , the king ’ s successor .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	4	16	There was no end to all the people who were before them . But those who came later were not pleased with the successor . This too is meaningless , a chasing after the wind . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	5	It is better not to make a vow than to make one and not fulfil it .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	2	Do not be quick with your mouth , do not be hasty in your heart to utter anything before God . God is in heaven and you are on earth , so let your words be few .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	3	A dream comes when there are many cares , and many words mark the speech of a fool .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	4	When you make a vow to God , do not delay to fulfil it . He has no pleasure in fools ; fulfil your vow .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	6	Do not let your mouth lead you into sin . And do not protest to the temple messenger , ‘ My vow was a mistake. ’ Why should God be angry at what you say and destroy the work of your hands ?
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	7	Much dreaming and many words are meaningless . Therefore fear God . Riches are meaningless
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	8	If you see the poor oppressed in a district , and justice and rights denied , do not be surprised at such things ; for one official is eyed by a higher one , and over them both are others higher still .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	9	The increase from the land is taken by all ; the king himself profits from the fields .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	10	Whoever loves money never has enough ; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income . This too is meaningless .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	11	As goods increase , so do those who consume them . And what benefit are they to the owners except to feast their eyes on them ?
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	12	The sleep of a labourer is sweet , whether they eat little or much , but as for the rich , their abundance permits them no sleep .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	13	I have seen a grievous evil under the sun : wealth hoarded to the harm of its owners ,
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	14	or wealth lost through some misfortune , so that when they have children there is nothing left for them to inherit .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	15	Everyone comes naked from their mother ’ s womb , and as everyone comes , so they depart . They take nothing from their toil that they can carry in their hands .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	16	This too is a grievous evil : as everyone comes , so they depart , and what do they gain , since they toil for the wind ?
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	17	All their days they eat in darkness , with great frustration , affliction and anger .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	18	This is what I have observed to be good : that it is appropriate for a person to eat , to drink and to find satisfaction in their toilsome labour under the sun during the few days of life God has given them – for this is their lot .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	19	Moreover , when God gives someone wealth and possessions , and the ability to enjoy them , to accept their lot and be happy in their toil – this is a gift of God .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	5	20	They seldom reflect on the days of their life , because God keeps them occupied with gladness of heart . Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 5:1 In Hebrew texts 5:1 is numbered 4:17 , and 5:2-20 is numbered 5:1-19 . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	6	6	even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity . Do not all go to the same place ?
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	6	2	God gives some people wealth , possessions and honour , so that they lack nothing their hearts desire , but God does not grant them the ability to enjoy them , and strangers enjoy them instead . This is meaningless , a grievous evil .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	6	3	A man may have a hundred children and live many years ; yet no matter how long he lives , if he can not enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial , I say that a stillborn child is better off than he .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	6	4	It comes without meaning , it departs in darkness , and in darkness its name is shrouded .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	6	5	Though it never saw the sun or knew anything , it has more rest than does that man –
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	6	7	Everyone ’ s toil is for their mouth , yet their appetite is never satisfied .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	6	8	What advantage have the wise over fools ? What do the poor gain by knowing how to conduct themselves before others ?
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	6	9	Better what the eye sees than the roving of the appetite . This too is meaningless , a chasing after the wind .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	6	10	Whatever exists has already been named , and what humanity is has been known ; no one can contend with someone who is stronger .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	6	11	The more the words , the less the meaning , and how does that profit anyone ?

NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	7	Extortion turns a wise person into a fool , and a bribe corrupts the heart .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	2	It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting , for death is the destiny of everyone ; the living should take this to heart .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	3	Frustration is better than laughter , because a sad face is good for the heart .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	4	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning , but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	5	It is better to heed the rebuke of a wise person than to listen to the song of fools .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	6	Like the crackling of thorns under the pot , so is the laughter of fools . This too is meaningless .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	8	The end of a matter is better than its beginning , and patience is better than pride .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	9	Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit , for anger resides in the lap of fools .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	10	Do not say , ‘ Why were the old days better than these ? ’ For it is not wise to ask such questions .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	11	Wisdom , like an inheritance , is a good thing and benefits those who see the sun .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	12	Wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter , but the advantage of knowledge is this : wisdom preserves those who have it .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	13	Consider what God has done : who can straighten what he has made crooked ?
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	14	When times are good , be happy ; but when times are bad , consider this : God has made the one as well as the other . Therefore , no one can discover anything about their future .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	15	In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these : the righteous perishing in their righteousness , and the wicked living long in their wickedness .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	16	Do not be over-righteous , neither be overwise – why destroy yourself ?
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	17	Do not be overwicked , and do not be a fool – why die before your time ?
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	18	It is good to grasp the one and not let go of the other . Whoever fears God will avoid all extremes . [ a ]
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	19	Wisdom makes one wise person more powerful than ten rulers in a city .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	20	Indeed , there is no one on earth who is righteous , no one who does what is right and never sins .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	21	Do not pay attention to every word people say , or you may hear your servant cursing you –
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	22	for you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	23	All this I tested by wisdom and I said , ‘ I am determined to be wise ’ – but this was beyond me .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	24	Whatever exists is far off and most profound – who can discover it ?
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	25	So I turned my mind to understand , to investigate and to search out wisdom and the scheme of things and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the madness of folly .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	26	I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare , whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains . The man who pleases God will escape her , but the sinner she will ensnare .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	27	‘ Look , ’ says the Teacher , [ b ] ‘ this is what I have discovered : ‘ Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things –
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	28	while I was still searching but not finding – I found one upright man among a thousand , but not one upright woman among them all .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	7	29	This only have I found : God created mankind upright , but they have gone in search of many schemes. ’ Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 7:18 Or will follow them both - Ecclesiastes 7:27 Or the leader of the assembly Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	8	8	As no one has power over the wind to contain it , so [ a ] no one has power over the time of their death . As no one is discharged in time of war , so wickedness will not release those who practise it .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	8	2	Obey the king ’ s command , I say , because you took an oath before God .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	8	3	Do not be in a hurry to leave the king ’ s presence . Do not stand up for a bad cause , for he will do whatever he pleases .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	8	4	Since a king ’ s word is supreme , who can say to him , ‘ What are you doing ? ’
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	8	5	Whoever obeys his command will come to no harm , and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	8	6	For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter , though a person may be weighed down by misery .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	8	7	Since no one knows the future , who can tell someone else what is to come ?
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	8	9	All this I saw , as I applied my mind to everything done under the sun . There is a time when a man lords it over others to his own [ b ] hurt .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	8	10	Then too , I saw the wicked buried – those who used to come and go from the holy place and receive praise [ c ] in the city where they did this . This too is meaningless .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	8	11	When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out , people ’ s hearts are filled with schemes to do wrong .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	8	12	Although a wicked person who commits a hundred crimes may live a long time , I know that it will go better with those who fear God , who are reverent before him .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	8	13	Yet because the wicked do not fear God , it will not go well with them , and their days will not lengthen like a shadow .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	8	14	There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth : the righteous who get what the wicked deserve , and the wicked who get what the righteous deserve . This too , I say , is meaningless .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	8	15	So I commend the enjoyment of life , because there is nothing better for a person under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad . Then joy will accompany them in their toil all the days of the life God has given them under the sun .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	8	16	When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe the labour that is done on earth – people getting no sleep day or night –
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	8	17	then I saw all that God has done . No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun . Despite all their efforts to search it out , no one can discover its meaning . Even if the wise claim they know , they can not really comprehend it .

NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	9	9	Enjoy life with your wife , whom you love , all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun – all your meaningless days . For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labour under the sun .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	9	2	All share a common destiny – the righteous and the wicked , the good and the bad , [ a ] the clean and the unclean , those who offer sacrifices and those who do not . As it is with the good , so with the sinful ; as it is with those who take oaths , so with those who are afraid to take them .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	9	3	This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun : The same destiny overtakes all . The hearts of people , moreover , are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live , and afterwards they join the dead .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	9	4	Anyone who is among the living has hope [ b ] – even a live dog is better off than a dead lion !
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	9	5	For the living know that they will die , but the dead know nothing ; they have no further reward , and even their name is forgotten .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	9	6	Their love , their hate and their jealousy have long since vanished ; never again will they have a part in anything that happens under the sun .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	9	7	Go , eat your food with gladness , and drink your wine with a joyful heart , for God has already approved what you do .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	9	8	Always be clothed in white , and always anoint your head with oil .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	9	10	Whatever your hand finds to do , do it with all your might , for in the realm of the dead , where you are going , there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	9	11	I have seen something else under the sun : The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong , nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favour to the learned ; but time and chance happen to them all .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	9	12	Moreover , no one knows when their hour will come : As fish are caught in a cruel net , or birds are taken in a snare , so people are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them . Wisdom better than folly
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	9	13	I also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me :
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	9	14	there was once a small city with only a few people in it . And a powerful king came against it , surrounded it and built huge siege works against it .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	9	15	Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise , and he saved the city by his wisdom . But nobody remembered that poor man .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	9	16	So I said , ‘ Wisdom is better than strength. ’ But the poor man ’ s wisdom is despised , and his words are no longer heeded .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	9	17	The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	9	18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war , but one sinner destroys much good .

NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	10	4	If a ruler ’ s anger rises against you , do not leave your post ; calmness can lay great offences to rest .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	10	5	There is an evil I have seen under the sun , the sort of error that arises from a ruler :
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	10	6	fools are put in many high positions , while the rich occupy the low ones .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	10	7	I have seen slaves on horseback , while princes go on foot like slaves .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	10	8	Whoever digs a pit may fall into it ; whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake .

NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	10	12	Words from the mouth of the wise are gracious , but fools are consumed by their own lips .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	10	13	At the beginning their words are folly ; at the end they are wicked madness –

NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	10	15	The toil of fools wearies them ; they do not know the way to town .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	10	16	Woe to the land whose king was a servant [ a ] and whose princes feast in the morning .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	10	17	Blessed is the land whose king is of noble birth and whose princes eat at a proper time – for strength and not for drunkenness .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	10	18	Through laziness , the rafters sag ; because of idle hands , the house leaks .
NIVUK	Ecclesiastes	10	19	A feast is made for laughter , wine makes life merry , and money is the answer for everything .

NIVUK	Isaiah	25	3	Therefore strong peoples will honour you ; cities of ruthless nations will revere you .
NIVUK	Isaiah	25	4	You have been a refuge for the poor , a refuge for the needy in their distress , a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat . For the breath of the ruthless is like a storm driving against a wall

NIVUK	Isaiah	28	16	So this is what the Sovereign Lord says : ‘ See , I lay a stone in Zion , a tested stone , a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation ; the one who relies on it will never be stricken with panic .

NIVUK	Isaiah	29	6	the Lord Almighty will come with thunder and earthquake and great noise , with whirlwind and tempest and flames of a devouring fire .
NIVUK	Isaiah	29	7	Then the hordes of all the nations that fight against Ariel , that attack her and her fortress and besiege her , will be as it is with a dream , with a vision in the night –
NIVUK	Isaiah	29	8	as when a hungry person dreams of eating , but awakens hungry still ; as when a thirsty person dreams of drinking , but awakens faint and thirsty still . So will it be with the hordes of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion .

NIVUK	Isaiah	30	30	The Lord will cause people to hear his majestic voice and will make them see his arm coming down with raging anger and consuming fire , with cloudburst , thunderstorm and hail .
NIVUK	Isaiah	30	2	who go down to Egypt without consulting me ; who look for help to Pharaoh ’ s protection , to Egypt ’ s shade for refuge .
NIVUK	Isaiah	30	3	But Pharaoh ’ s protection will be to your shame , Egypt ’ s shade will bring you disgrace .
NIVUK	Isaiah	30	4	Though they have officials in Zoan and their envoys have arrived in Hanes ,
NIVUK	Isaiah	30	5	everyone will be put to shame because of a people useless to them , who bring neither help nor advantage , but only shame and disgrace. ’
NIVUK	Isaiah	30	6	A prophecy concerning the animals of the Negev : Through a land of hardship and distress , of lions and lionesses , of adders and darting snakes , the envoys carry their riches on donkeys ’ backs , their treasures on the humps of camels , to that unprofitable nation ,

NIVUK	Isaiah	30	10	They say to the seers , ‘ See no more visions ! ’ and to the prophets , ‘ Give us no more visions of what is right ! Tell us pleasant things , prophesy illusions .
NIVUK	Isaiah	30	11	Leave this way , get off this path , and stop confronting us with the Holy One of Israel ! ’

NIVUK	Isaiah	30	15	This is what the Sovereign Lord , the Holy One of Israel , says : ‘ In repentance and rest is your salvation , in quietness and trust is your strength , but you would have none of it .
NIVUK	Isaiah	30	16	You said , “ No , we will flee on horses. ” Therefore you will flee ! You said , “ We will ride off on swift horses. ” Therefore your pursuers will be swift !
NIVUK	Isaiah	30	17	A thousand will flee at the threat of one ; at the threat of five you will all flee away , till you are left like a flagstaff on a mountaintop , like a banner on a hill. ’

NIVUK	Isaiah	31	31	Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help , who rely on horses , who trust in the multitude of their chariots and in the great strength of their horsemen , but do not look to the Holy One of Israel , or seek help from the Lord .
NIVUK	Isaiah	31	2	Yet he too is wise and can bring disaster ; he does not take back his words . He will rise up against that wicked nation , against those who help evildoers .
NIVUK	Isaiah	31	3	But the Egyptians are mere mortals and not God ; their horses are flesh and not spirit . When the Lord stretches out his hand , those who help will stumble , those who are helped will fall ; all will perish together .
NIVUK	Isaiah	31	4	This is what the Lord says to me : ‘ As a lion growls , a great lion over its prey – and though a whole band of shepherds is called together against it , it is not frightened by their shouts or disturbed by their clamour – so the Lord Almighty will come down to do battle on Mount Zion and on its heights .

NIVUK	Isaiah	32	5	No longer will the fool be called noble nor the scoundrel be highly respected .
NIVUK	Isaiah	32	6	For fools speak folly , their hearts are bent on evil : they practise ungodliness and spread error concerning the Lord ; the hungry they leave empty and from the thirsty they withhold water .
NIVUK	Isaiah	32	7	Scoundrels use wicked methods , they make up evil schemes to destroy the poor with lies , even when the plea of the needy is just .
NIVUK	Isaiah	32	8	But the noble make noble plans , and by noble deeds they stand . The women of Jerusalem
NIVUK	Isaiah	32	9	You women who are so complacent , rise up and listen to me ; you daughters who feel secure , hear what I have to say !
NIVUK	Isaiah	32	10	In little more than a year you who feel secure will tremble ; the grape harvest will fail , and the harvest of fruit will not come .
NIVUK	Isaiah	32	11	Tremble , you complacent women ; shudder , you daughters who feel secure ! Strip off your fine clothes and wrap yourselves in rags .
NIVUK	Isaiah	32	12	Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields , for the fruitful vines
NIVUK	Isaiah	32	13	and for the land of my people , a land overgrown with thorns and briers – yes , mourn for all houses of merriment and for this city of revelry .
NIVUK	Isaiah	32	14	The fortress will be abandoned , the noisy city deserted ; citadel and watchtower will become a wasteland for ever , the delight of donkeys , a pasture for flocks ,
NIVUK	Isaiah	32	15	till the Spirit is poured on us from on high , and the desert becomes a fertile field , and the fertile field seems like a forest .
NIVUK	Isaiah	32	16	The Lord ’ s justice will dwell in the desert , his righteousness live in the fertile field .
NIVUK	Isaiah	32	17	The fruit of that righteousness will be peace ; its effect will be quietness and confidence for ever .

NIVUK	Isaiah	33	7	Look , their brave men cry aloud in the streets ; the envoys of peace weep bitterly .

NIVUK	Isaiah	33	13	You who are far away , hear what I have done ; you who are near , acknowledge my power !
NIVUK	Isaiah	33	14	The sinners in Zion are terrified ; trembling grips the godless : ‘ Who of us can dwell with the consuming fire ? Who of us can dwell with everlasting burning ? ’
NIVUK	Isaiah	33	15	Those who walk righteously and speak what is right , who reject gain from extortion and keep their hands from accepting bribes , who stop their ears against plots of murder and shut their eyes against contemplating evil –

NIVUK	Isaiah	33	17	Your eyes will see the king in his beauty and view a land that stretches afar .
NIVUK	Isaiah	33	18	In your thoughts you will ponder the former terror : ‘ Where is that chief officer ? Where is the one who took the revenue ? Where is the officer in charge of the towers ? ’
NIVUK	Isaiah	33	19	You will see those arrogant people no more , people whose speech is obscure , whose language is strange and incomprehensible .
NIVUK	Isaiah	33	20	Look on Zion , the city of our festivals ; your eyes will see Jerusalem , a peaceful abode , a tent that will not be moved ; its stakes will never be pulled up , nor any of its ropes broken .
NIVUK	Isaiah	33	21	There the Lord will be our Mighty One . It will be like a place of broad rivers and streams . No galley with oars will ride them , no mighty ship will sail them .
NIVUK	Isaiah	33	22	For the Lord is our judge , the Lord is our lawgiver , the Lord is our king ; it is he who will save us .
NIVUK	Isaiah	33	23	Your rigging hangs loose : the mast is not held secure , the sail is not spread . Then an abundance of spoils will be divided and even the lame will carry off plunder .

NIVUK	Isaiah	36	36	In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah ’ s reign , Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them .
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	2	Then the king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem . When the commander stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool , on the road to the Launderer ’ s Field ,
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	3	Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator , Shebna the secretary , and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to him .
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	4	The field commander said to them , ‘ Tell Hezekiah : ‘ “ This is what the great king , the king of Assyria , says : on what are you basing this confidence of yours ?
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	5	You say you have counsel and might for war – but you speak only empty words . On whom are you depending , that you rebel against me ?
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	6	Look , I know you are depending on Egypt , that splintered reed of a staff , which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it ! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him .
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	7	But if you say to me , ‘ We are depending on the Lord our God ’ – isn ’ t he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed , saying to Judah and Jerusalem , ‘ You must worship before this altar ’ ?
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	8	‘ “ Come now , make a bargain with my master , the king of Assyria : I will give you two thousand horses – if you can put riders on them !
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	9	How then can you repulse one officer of the least of my master ’ s officials , even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen [ a ] ?
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	10	Furthermore , have I come to attack and destroy this land without the Lord ? The Lord himself told me to march against this country and destroy it. ” ’
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	11	Then Eliakim , Shebna and Joah said to the field commander , ‘ Please speak to your servants in Aramaic , since we understand it . Don ’ t speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall. ’
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	12	But the commander replied , ‘ Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things , and not to the people sitting on the wall – who , like you , will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine ? ’
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	13	Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew , ‘ Hear the words of the great king , the king of Assyria !
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	14	This is what the king says : do not let Hezekiah deceive you . He can not deliver you !
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	15	Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the Lord when he says , “ The Lord will surely deliver us ; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. ”
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	16	‘ Do not listen to Hezekiah . This is what the king of Assyria says : make peace with me and come out to me . Then each of you will eat fruit from your own vine and fig-tree and drink water from your own cistern ,
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	17	until I come and take you to a land like your own – a land of corn and new wine , a land of bread and vineyards .
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	18	‘ Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says , “ The Lord will deliver us. ” Have the gods of any nations ever delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria ?
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	19	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim ? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand ?
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	20	Who of all the gods of these countries have been able to save their lands from me ? How then can the Lord deliver Jerusalem from my hand ? ’
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	21	But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply , because the king had commanded , ‘ Do not answer him. ’
NIVUK	Isaiah	36	22	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator , Shebna the secretary and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah , with their clothes torn , and told him what the field commander had said .

NIVUK	Isaiah	37	8	When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish , he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah .
NIVUK	Isaiah	37	9	Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah , the king of Cush , [ a ] was marching out to fight against him . When he heard it , he sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word :
NIVUK	Isaiah	37	10	‘ Say to Hezekiah king of Judah : do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says , “ Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria. ”
NIVUK	Isaiah	37	11	Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries , destroying them completely . And will you be delivered ?
NIVUK	Isaiah	37	12	Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my predecessors deliver them – the gods of Gozan , Harran , Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar ?
NIVUK	Isaiah	37	13	Where is the king of Hamath or the king of Arpad ? Where are the kings of Lair , Sepharvaim , Hena and Ivvah ? ’ Hezekiah ’ s prayer
NIVUK	Isaiah	37	14	Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it . Then he went up to the temple of the Lord and spread it out before the Lord .
NIVUK	Isaiah	37	15	And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord :
NIVUK	Isaiah	37	16	‘ Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , enthroned between the cherubim , you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth . You have made heaven and earth .
NIVUK	Isaiah	37	17	Give ear , Lord , and hear ; open your eyes , Lord , and see ; listen to all the words Sennacherib has sent to ridicule the living God .

NIVUK	Isaiah	37	23	Who is it you have ridiculed and blasphemed ? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride ? Against the Holy One of Israel !
NIVUK	Isaiah	37	24	By your messengers you have ridiculed the Lord . And you have said , “ With my many chariots I have ascended the heights of the mountains , the utmost heights of Lebanon .

NIVUK	Isaiah	38	38	In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death . The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said , ‘ This is what the Lord says : put your house in order , because you are going to die ; you will not recover. ’
NIVUK	Isaiah	38	2	Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord ,
NIVUK	Isaiah	38	3	‘ Remember , Lord , how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes. ’ And Hezekiah wept bitterly .
NIVUK	Isaiah	38	4	Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah :
NIVUK	Isaiah	38	5	‘ Go and tell Hezekiah , “ This is what the Lord , the God of your father David , says : I have heard your prayer and seen your tears ; I will add fifteen years to your life .

NIVUK	Isaiah	38	11	I said , ‘ I will not again see the Lord himself in the land of the living ; no longer will I look on my fellow man , or be with those who now dwell in this world .
NIVUK	Isaiah	38	12	Like a shepherd ’ s tent my house has been pulled down and taken from me . Like a weaver I have rolled up my life , and he has cut me off from the loom ; day and night you made an end of me .

NIVUK	Isaiah	38	14	I cried like a swift or thrush , I moaned like a mourning dove . My eyes grew weak as I looked to the heavens . I am being threatened ; Lord , come to my aid ! ’
NIVUK	Isaiah	38	15	But what can I say ? He has spoken to me , and he himself has done this . I will walk humbly all my years because of this anguish of my soul .
NIVUK	Isaiah	38	16	Lord , by such things people live ; and my spirit finds life in them too . You restored me to health and let me live .
NIVUK	Isaiah	38	17	Surely it was for my benefit that I suffered such anguish . In your love you kept me from the pit of destruction ; you have put all my sins behind your back .
NIVUK	Isaiah	38	18	For the grave can not praise you , death can not sing your praise ; those who go down to the pit can not hope for your faithfulness .

NIVUK	Isaiah	39	2	Hezekiah received the envoys gladly and showed them what was in his storehouses – the silver , the gold , the spices , the fine olive oil – his entire armoury and everything found among his treasures .

NIVUK	Isaiah	53	53	Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ?
NIVUK	Isaiah	53	2	He grew up before him like a tender shoot , and like a root out of dry ground . He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him , nothing in his appearance that we should desire him .
NIVUK	Isaiah	53	3	He was despised and rejected by mankind , a man of suffering , and familiar with pain . Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised , and we held him in low esteem .
NIVUK	Isaiah	53	4	Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering , yet we considered him punished by God , stricken by him , and afflicted .
NIVUK	Isaiah	53	5	But he was pierced for our transgressions , he was crushed for our iniquities ; the punishment that brought us peace was on him , and by his wounds we are healed .
NIVUK	Isaiah	53	6	We all , like sheep , have gone astray , each of us has turned to our own way ; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all .
NIVUK	Isaiah	53	7	He was oppressed and afflicted , yet he did not open his mouth ; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter , and as a sheep before its shearers is silent , so he did not open his mouth .
NIVUK	Isaiah	53	8	By oppression [ a ] and judgment he was taken away . Yet who of his generation protested ? For he was cut off from the land of the living ; for the transgression of my people he was punished . [ b ]
NIVUK	Isaiah	53	9	He was assigned a grave with the wicked , and with the rich in his death , though he had done no violence , nor was any deceit in his mouth .
NIVUK	Isaiah	53	10	Yet it was the Lord ’ s will to crush him and cause him to suffer , and though the Lord makes [ c ] his life an offering for sin , he will see his offspring and prolong his days , and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand .

NIVUK	Isaiah	57	3	‘ But you – come here , you children of a sorceress , you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes !
NIVUK	Isaiah	57	4	Who are you mocking ? At whom do you sneer and stick out your tongue ? Are you not a brood of rebels , the offspring of liars ?
NIVUK	Isaiah	57	5	You burn with lust among the oaks and under every spreading tree ; you sacrifice your children in the ravines and under the overhanging crags .
NIVUK	Isaiah	57	6	The idols among the smooth stones of the ravines are your portion ; indeed , they are your lot . Yes , to them you have poured out drink offerings and offered grain offerings . In view of all this , should I relent ?
NIVUK	Isaiah	57	7	You have made your bed on a high and lofty hill ; there you went up to offer your sacrifices .
NIVUK	Isaiah	57	8	Behind your doors and your doorposts you have put your pagan symbols . Forsaking me , you uncovered your bed , you climbed into it and opened it wide ; you made a pact with those whose beds you love , and you looked with lust on their naked bodies .
NIVUK	Isaiah	57	9	You went to Molek [ a ] with olive oil and increased your perfumes . You sent your ambassadors [ b ] far away ; you descended to the very realm of the dead !
NIVUK	Isaiah	57	10	You wearied yourself by such going about , but you would not say , “ It is hopeless. ” You found renewal of your strength , and so you did not faint .
NIVUK	Isaiah	57	11	‘ Whom have you so dreaded and feared that you have not been true to me , and have neither remembered me nor taken this to heart ? Is it not because I have long been silent that you do not fear me ?
NIVUK	Isaiah	57	12	I will expose your righteousness and your works , and they will not benefit you .

NIVUK	Isaiah	57	16	I will not accuse them for ever , nor will I always be angry , for then they would faint away because of me – the very people I have created .

NIVUK	Isaiah	58	3	“ Why have we fasted , ” they say , “ and you have not seen it ? Why have we humbled ourselves , and you have not noticed ? ” ‘ Yet on the day of your fasting , you do as you please and exploit all your workers .
NIVUK	Isaiah	58	4	Your fasting ends in quarrelling and strife , and in striking each other with wicked fists . You can not fast as you do today and expect your voice to be heard on high .
NIVUK	Isaiah	58	5	Is this the kind of fast I have chosen , only a day for people to humble themselves ? Is it only for bowing one ’ s head like a reed and for lying in sackcloth and ashes ? Is that what you call a fast , a day acceptable to the Lord ?

NIVUK	Isaiah	59	59	Surely the arm of the Lord is not too short to save , nor his ear too dull to hear .
NIVUK	Isaiah	59	2	But your iniquities have separated you from your God ; your sins have hidden his face from you , so that he will not hear .
NIVUK	Isaiah	59	3	For your hands are stained with blood , your fingers with guilt . Your lips have spoken falsely , and your tongue mutters wicked things .
NIVUK	Isaiah	59	4	No one calls for justice ; no one pleads a case with integrity . They rely on empty arguments , they utter lies ; they conceive trouble and give birth to evil .
NIVUK	Isaiah	59	5	They hatch the eggs of vipers and spin a spider ’ s web . Whoever eats their eggs will die , and when one is broken , an adder is hatched .
NIVUK	Isaiah	59	6	Their cobwebs are useless for clothing ; they can not cover themselves with what they make . Their deeds are evil deeds , and acts of violence are in their hands .
NIVUK	Isaiah	59	7	Their feet rush into sin ; they are swift to shed innocent blood . They pursue evil schemes ; acts of violence mark their ways .
NIVUK	Isaiah	59	8	The way of peace they do not know ; there is no justice in their paths . They have turned them into crooked roads ; no one who walks along them will know peace .
NIVUK	Isaiah	59	9	So justice is far from us , and righteousness does not reach us . We look for light , but all is darkness ; for brightness , but we walk in deep shadows .
NIVUK	Isaiah	59	10	Like the blind we grope along the wall , feeling our way like people without eyes . At midday we stumble as if it were twilight ; among the strong , we are like the dead .
NIVUK	Isaiah	59	11	We all growl like bears ; we moan mournfully like doves . We look for justice , but find none ; for deliverance , but it is far away .
NIVUK	Isaiah	59	12	For our offences are many in your sight , and our sins testify against us . Our offences are ever with us , and we acknowledge our iniquities :
NIVUK	Isaiah	59	13	rebellion and treachery against the Lord , turning our backs on our God , inciting revolt and oppression , uttering lies our hearts have conceived .
NIVUK	Isaiah	59	14	So justice is driven back , and righteousness stands at a distance ; truth has stumbled in the streets , honesty can not enter .
NIVUK	Isaiah	59	15	Truth is nowhere to be found , and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey . The Lord looked and was displeased that there was no justice .
NIVUK	Isaiah	59	16	He saw that there was no one , he was appalled that there was no one to intervene ; so his own arm achieved salvation for him , and his own righteousness sustained him .
NIVUK	Isaiah	59	17	He put on righteousness as his breastplate , and the helmet of salvation on his head ; he put on the garments of vengeance and wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak .
NIVUK	Isaiah	59	18	According to what they have done , so will he repay wrath to his enemies and retribution to his foes ; he will repay the islands their due .
NIVUK	Isaiah	59	19	From the west , people will fear the name of the Lord , and from the rising of the sun , they will revere his glory . For he will come like a pent-up flood that the breath of the Lord drives along . [ a ]

NIVUK	Isaiah	63	2	Why are your garments red , like those of one treading the winepress ?
NIVUK	Isaiah	63	3	‘ I have trodden the winepress alone ; from the nations no one was with me . I trampled them in my anger and trod them down in my wrath ; their blood spattered my garments , and I stained all my clothing .

NIVUK	Isaiah	65	65	‘ I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me ; I was found by those who did not seek me . To a nation that did not call on my name , I said , “ Here am I , here am I. ”
NIVUK	Isaiah	65	2	All day long I have held out my hands to an obstinate people , who walk in ways not good , pursuing their own imaginations –
NIVUK	Isaiah	65	3	a people who continually provoke me to my very face , offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on altars of brick ;
NIVUK	Isaiah	65	4	who sit among the graves and spend their nights keeping secret vigil ; who eat the flesh of pigs , and whose pots hold broth of impure meat ;
NIVUK	Isaiah	65	5	who say , “ Keep away ; don ’ t come near me , for I am too sacred for you ! ” Such people are smoke in my nostrils , a fire that keeps burning all day .
NIVUK	Isaiah	65	6	‘ See , it stands written before me ; I will not keep silent but will pay back in full ; I will pay it back into their laps –
NIVUK	Isaiah	65	7	both your sins and the sins of your ancestors , ’ says the Lord . ‘ Because they burned sacrifices on the mountains and defied me on the hills , I will measure into their laps the full payment for their former deeds. ’
NIVUK	Isaiah	65	8	This is what the Lord says : ‘ As when juice is still found in a cluster of grapes and people say , “ Don ’ t destroy it , there is still a blessing in it , ” so will I do on behalf of my servants ; I will not destroy them all .
NIVUK	Isaiah	65	9	I will bring forth descendants from Jacob , and from Judah those who will possess my mountains ; my chosen people will inherit them , and there will my servants live .
NIVUK	Isaiah	65	10	Sharon will become a pasture for flocks , and the Valley of Achor a resting-place for herds , for my people who seek me .

NIVUK	Isaiah	65	13	Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says : ‘ My servants will eat , but you will go hungry ; my servants will drink , but you will go thirsty ; my servants will rejoice , but you will be put to shame .
NIVUK	Isaiah	65	14	My servants will sing out of the joy of their hearts , but you will cry out from anguish of heart and wail in brokenness of spirit .
NIVUK	Isaiah	65	15	You will leave your name for my chosen ones to use in their curses ; the Sovereign Lord will put you to death , but to his servants he will give another name .

NIVUK	Isaiah	65	19	I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people ; the sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more .
NIVUK	Isaiah	65	20	‘ Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days , or an old man who does not live out his years ; the one who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere child ; the one who fails to reach [ a ] a hundred will be considered accursed .
NIVUK	Isaiah	65	21	They will build houses and dwell in them ; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit .
NIVUK	Isaiah	65	22	No longer will they build houses and others live in them , or plant and others eat . For as the days of a tree , so will be the days of my people ; my chosen ones will long enjoy the work of their hands .

They have chosen their own ways , and they delight in their abominations ;

NIVUK	Isaiah	66	13	As a mother comforts her child , so will I comfort you ; and you will be comforted over Jerusalem. ’

NIVUK	Jeremiah	2	32	Does a young woman forget her jewellery , a bride her wedding ornaments ? Yet my people have forgotten me , days without number .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	2	33	How skilled you are at pursuing love ! Even the worst of women can learn from your ways .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	2	34	On your clothes is found the lifeblood of the innocent poor , though you did not catch them breaking in . Yet in spite of all this
NIVUK	Jeremiah	2	35	you say , “ I am innocent ; he is not angry with me. ” But I will pass judgment on you because you say , “ I have not sinned. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	2	36	Why do you go about so much , changing your ways ? You will be disappointed by Egypt as you were by Assyria .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	2	37	You will also leave that place with your hands on your head , for the Lord has rejected those you trust ; you will not be helped by them .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	3	Therefore the showers have been withheld , and no spring rains have fallen . Yet you have the brazen look of a prostitute ; you refuse to blush with shame .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	2	‘ Look up to the barren heights and see . Is there any place where you have not been ravished ? By the roadside you sat waiting for lovers , sat like a nomad in the desert . You have defiled the land with your prostitution and wickedness .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	4	Have you not just called to me : “ My Father , my friend from my youth ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	5	will you always be angry ? Will your wrath continue for ever ? ” This is how you talk , but you do all the evil you can. ’ Unfaithful Israel
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	6	During the reign of King Josiah , the Lord said to me , ‘ Have you seen what faithless Israel has done ? She has gone up on every high hill and under every spreading tree and has committed adultery there .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	7	I thought that after she had done all this she would return to me but she did not , and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	8	I gave faithless Israel her certificate of divorce and sent her away because of all her adulteries . Yet I saw that her unfaithful sister Judah had no fear ; she also went out and committed adultery .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	9	Because Israel ’ s immorality mattered so little to her , she defiled the land and committed adultery with stone and wood .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	10	In spite of all this , her unfaithful sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart , but only in pretence , ’ declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	11	The Lord said to me , ‘ Faithless Israel is more righteous than unfaithful Judah .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	12	Go , proclaim this message towards the north : ‘ “ Return , faithless Israel , ” declares the Lord , “ I will frown on you no longer , for I am faithful , ” declares the Lord , “ I will not be angry for ever .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	13	Only acknowledge your guilt – you have rebelled against the Lord your God , you have scattered your favours to foreign gods under every spreading tree , and have not obeyed me , ” ’ declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	14	‘ Return , faithless people , ’ declares the Lord , ‘ for I am your husband . I will choose you – one from a town and two from a clan – and bring you to Zion .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	15	Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart , who will lead you with knowledge and understanding .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	16	In those days , when your numbers have increased greatly in the land , ’ declares the Lord , ‘ people will no longer say , “ The ark of the covenant of the Lord. ” It will never enter their minds or be remembered ; it will not be missed , nor will another one be made .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	17	At that time they will call Jerusalem The Throne of the Lord , and all nations will gather in Jerusalem to honour the name of the Lord . No longer will they follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	18	In those days the people of Judah will join the people of Israel , and together they will come from a northern land to the land I gave your ancestors as an inheritance .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	19	‘ I myself said , ‘ “ How gladly would I treat you like my children and give you a pleasant land , the most beautiful inheritance of any nation. ” I thought you would call me “ Father ” and not turn away from following me .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	20	But like a woman unfaithful to her husband , so you , Israel , have been unfaithful to me , ’ declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	21	A cry is heard on the barren heights , the weeping and pleading of the people of Israel , because they have perverted their ways and have forgotten the Lord their God .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	22	‘ Return , faithless people ; I will cure you of backsliding. ’ ‘ Yes , we will come to you , for you are the Lord our God .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	23	Surely the idolatrous commotion on the hills and mountains is a deception ; surely in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	24	From our youth shameful gods have consumed the fruits of our ancestors ’ labour – their flocks and herds , their sons and daughters .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	3	25	Let us lie down in our shame , and let our disgrace cover us . We have sinned against the Lord our God , both we and our ancestors ; from our youth till this day we have not obeyed the Lord our God. ’ Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	4	Circumcise yourselves to the Lord , circumcise your hearts , you people of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem , or my wrath will flare up and burn like fire because of the evil you have done – burn with no one to quench it . Disaster from the North
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	2	and if in a truthful , just and righteous way you swear , “ As surely as the Lord lives , ” then the nations will invoke blessings by him and in him they will boast. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	3	This is what the Lord says to the people of Judah and to Jerusalem : ‘ Break up your unploughed ground and do not sow among thorns .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	5	‘ Announce in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem and say : “ Sound the trumpet throughout the land ! ” Cry aloud and say : “ Gather together ! Let us flee to the fortified cities ! ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	6	Raise the signal to go to Zion ! Flee for safety without delay ! For I am bringing disaster from the north , even terrible destruction. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	7	A lion has come out of his lair ; a destroyer of nations has set out . He has left his place to lay waste your land . Your towns will lie in ruins without inhabitant .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	8	So put on sackcloth , lament and wail , for the fierce anger of the Lord has not turned away from us .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	9	‘ In that day , ’ declares the Lord , ‘ the king and the officials will lose heart , the priests will be horrified , and the prophets will be appalled. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	10	Then I said , ‘ Alas , Sovereign Lord ! How completely you have deceived this people and Jerusalem by saying , “ You will have peace , ” when the sword is at our throats ! ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	11	At that time this people and Jerusalem will be told , ‘ A scorching wind from the barren heights in the desert blows towards my people , but not to winnow or cleanse ;
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	12	a wind too strong for that comes from me . Now I pronounce my judgments against them. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	13	Look ! He advances like the clouds , his chariots come like a whirlwind , his horses are swifter than eagles . Woe to us ! We are ruined !
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	14	Jerusalem , wash the evil from your heart and be saved . How long will you harbour wicked thoughts ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	15	A voice is announcing from Dan , proclaiming disaster from the hills of Ephraim .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	16	‘ Tell this to the nations , proclaim concerning Jerusalem : “ A besieging army is coming from a distant land , raising a war cry against the cities of Judah .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	17	They surround her like men guarding a field , because she has rebelled against me , ” ’ declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	18	‘ Your own conduct and actions have brought this on you . This is your punishment . How bitter it is ! How it pierces to the heart ! ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	19	Oh , my anguish , my anguish ! I writhe in pain . Oh , the agony of my heart ! My heart pounds within me , I can not keep silent . For I have heard the sound of the trumpet ; I have heard the battle cry .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	20	Disaster follows disaster ; the whole land lies in ruins . In an instant my tents are destroyed , my shelter in a moment .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	21	How long must I see the battle standard and hear the sound of the trumpet ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	22	‘ My people are fools ; they do not know me . They are senseless children ; they have no understanding . They are skilled in doing evil ; they know not how to do good. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	23	I looked at the earth , and it was formless and empty ; and at the heavens , and their light was gone .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	24	I looked at the mountains , and they were quaking ; all the hills were swaying .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	25	I looked , and there were no people ; every bird in the sky had flown away .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	26	I looked , and the fruitful land was a desert ; all its towns lay in ruins before the Lord , before his fierce anger .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	27	This is what the Lord says : ‘ The whole land will be ruined , though I will not destroy it completely .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	28	Therefore the earth will mourn and the heavens above grow dark , because I have spoken and will not relent , I have decided and will not turn back. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	29	At the sound of horsemen and archers every town takes to flight . Some go into the thickets ; some climb up among the rocks . All the towns are deserted ; no one lives in them .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	30	What are you doing , you devastated one ? Why dress yourself in scarlet and put on jewels of gold ? Why highlight your eyes with makeup ? You adorn yourself in vain . Your lovers despise you ; they want to kill you .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	4	31	I hear a cry as of a woman in labour , a groan as of one bearing her first child – the cry of Daughter Zion gasping for breath , stretching out her hands and saying , ‘ Alas ! I am fainting ; my life is given over to murderers. ’ Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	5	So I will go to the leaders and speak to them ; surely they know the way of the Lord , the requirements of their God. ’ But with one accord they too had broken off the yoke and torn off the bonds .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	2	Although they say , “ As surely as the Lord lives , ” still they are swearing falsely. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	3	Lord , do not your eyes look for truth ? You struck them , but they felt no pain ; you crushed them but they refused correction . They made their faces harder than stone and refused to repent .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	4	I thought , ‘ These are only the poor ; they are foolish , for they do not know the way of the Lord , the requirements of their God .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	6	Therefore a lion from the forest will attack them , a wolf from the desert will ravage them , a leopard will lie in wait near their towns to tear to pieces any who venture out , for their rebellion is great and their backslidings many .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	7	‘ Why should I forgive you ? Your children have forsaken me and sworn by gods that are not gods . I supplied all their needs , yet they committed adultery and thronged to the houses of prostitutes .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	8	They are well-fed , lusty stallions , each neighing for another man ’ s wife .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	9	Should I not punish them for this ? ’ declares the Lord . ‘ Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	10	‘ Go through her vineyards and ravage them , but do not destroy them completely . Strip off her branches , for these people do not belong to the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	11	The people of Israel and the people of Judah have been utterly unfaithful to me , ’ declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	12	They have lied about the Lord ; they said , ‘ He will do nothing ! No harm will come to us ; we will never see sword or famine .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	13	The prophets are but wind and the word is not in them ; so let what they say be done to them. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	14	Therefore this is what the Lord God Almighty says : ‘ Because the people have spoken these words , I will make my words in your mouth a fire and these people the wood it consumes .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	15	People of Israel , ’ declares the Lord , ‘ I am bringing a distant nation against you – an ancient and enduring nation , a people whose language you do not know , whose speech you do not understand .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	16	Their quivers are like an open grave ; all of them are mighty warriors .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	17	They will devour your harvests and food , devour your sons and daughters ; they will devour your flocks and herds , devour your vines and fig trees . With the sword they will destroy the fortified cities in which you trust .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	18	‘ Yet even in those days , ’ declares the Lord , ‘ I will not destroy you completely .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	19	And when the people ask , “ Why has the Lord our God done all this to us ? ” you will tell them , “ As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your own land , so now you will serve foreigners in a land not your own. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	20	‘ Announce this to the descendants of Jacob and proclaim it in Judah :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	21	Hear this , you foolish and senseless people , who have eyes but do not see , who have ears but do not hear :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	22	Should you not fear me ? ’ declares the Lord . ‘ Should you not tremble in my presence ? I made the sand a boundary for the sea , an everlasting barrier it can not cross . The waves may roll , but they can not prevail ; they may roar , but they can not cross it .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	23	But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts ; they have turned aside and gone away .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	24	They do not say to themselves , “ Let us fear the Lord our God , who gives autumn and spring rains in season , who assures us of the regular weeks of harvest. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	25	Your wrongdoings have kept these away ; your sins have deprived you of good .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	26	‘ Among my people are the wicked who lie in wait like men who snare birds and like those who set traps to catch people .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	27	Like cages full of birds , their houses are full of deceit ; they have become rich and powerful
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	28	and have grown fat and sleek . Their evil deeds have no limit ; they do not seek justice . They do not promote the case of the fatherless ; they do not defend the just cause of the poor .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	29	Should I not punish them for this ? ’ declares the Lord . ‘ Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	5	30	‘ A horrible and shocking thing has happened in the land :

NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	6	This is what the Lord Almighty says : ‘ Cut down the trees and build siege ramps against Jerusalem . This city must be punished ; it is filled with oppression .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	2	I will destroy Daughter Zion , so beautiful and delicate .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	3	Shepherds with their flocks will come against her ; they will pitch their tents round her , each tending his own portion. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	4	‘ Prepare for battle against her ! Arise , let us attack at noon ! But , alas , the daylight is fading , and the shadows of evening grow long .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	5	So arise , let us attack at night and destroy her fortresses ! ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	7	As a well pours out its water , so she pours out her wickedness . Violence and destruction resound in her ; her sickness and wounds are ever before me .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	8	Take warning , Jerusalem , or I will turn away from you and make your land desolate so that no one can live in it. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	9	This is what the Lord Almighty says : ‘ Let them glean the remnant of Israel as thoroughly as a vine ; pass your hand over the branches again , like one gathering grapes. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	10	To whom can I speak and give warning ? Who will listen to me ? Their ears are closed [ a ] so that they can not hear . The word of the Lord is offensive to them ; they find no pleasure in it .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	11	But I am full of the wrath of the Lord , and I can not hold it in . ‘ Pour it out on the children in the street and on the young men gathered together ; both husband and wife will be caught in it , and the old , those weighed down with years .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	12	Their houses will be turned over to others , together with their fields and their wives , when I stretch out my hand against those who live in the land , ’ declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	13	‘ From the least to the greatest , all are greedy for gain ; prophets and priests alike , all practise deceit .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	14	They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious . “ Peace , peace , ” they say , when there is no peace .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	15	Are they ashamed of their detestable conduct ? No , they have no shame at all ; they do not even know how to blush . So they will fall among the fallen ; they will be brought down when I punish them , ’ says the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	16	This is what the Lord says : ‘ Stand at the crossroads and look ; ask for the ancient paths , ask where the good way is , and walk in it , and you will find rest for your souls . But you said , “ We will not walk in it. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	17	I appointed watchmen over you and said , “ Listen to the sound of the trumpet ! ” But you said , “ We will not listen. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	18	Therefore hear , you nations ; you who are witnesses , observe what will happen to them .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	19	Hear , you earth : I am bringing disaster on this people , the fruit of their schemes , because they have not listened to my words and have rejected my law .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	20	What do I care about incense from Sheba or sweet calamus from a distant land ? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable ; your sacrifices do not please me. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	21	Therefore this is what the Lord says : ‘ I will put obstacles before this people . Parents and children alike will stumble over them ; neighbours and friends will perish. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	22	This is what the Lord says : ‘ Look , an army is coming from the land of the north ; a great nation is being stirred up from the ends of the earth .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	23	They are armed with bow and spear ; they are cruel and show no mercy . They sound like the roaring sea as they ride on their horses ; they come like men in battle formation to attack you , Daughter Zion. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	24	We have heard reports about them , and our hands hang limp . Anguish has gripped us , pain like that of a woman in labour .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	25	Do not go out to the fields or walk on the roads , for the enemy has a sword , and there is terror on every side .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	26	Put on sackcloth , my people , and roll in ashes ; mourn with bitter wailing as for an only son , for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	6	27	‘ I have made you a tester of metals and my people the ore , that you may observe and test their ways .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	7	21	‘ “ This is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : go ahead , add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat the meat yourselves !
NIVUK	Jeremiah	7	22	For when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them , I did not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	7	23	but I gave them this command : obey me , and I will be your God and you will be my people . Walk in obedience to all I command you , that it may go well with you .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	7	24	But they did not listen or pay attention ; instead , they followed the stubborn inclinations of their evil hearts . They went backwards and not forwards .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	7	25	From the time your ancestors left Egypt until now , day after day , again and again I sent you my servants the prophets .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	7	26	But they did not listen to me or pay attention . They were stiff-necked and did more evil than their ancestors. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	7	27	‘ When you tell them all this , they will not listen to you ; when you call to them , they will not answer .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	9	Should I not punish them for this ? ’ declares the Lord . ‘ Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this ? ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	2	Oh , that I had in the desert a lodging place for travellers , so that I might leave my people and go away from them ; for they are all adulterers , a crowd of unfaithful people .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	3	‘ They make ready their tongue like a bow , to shoot lies ; it is not by truth that they triumph [ b ] in the land . They go from one sin to another ; they do not acknowledge me , ’ declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	4	‘ Beware of your friends ; do not trust anyone in your clan . For every one of them is a deceiver , [ c ] and every friend a slanderer .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	5	Friend deceives friend , and no one speaks the truth . They have taught their tongues to lie ; they weary themselves with sinning .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	6	You [ d ] live in the midst of deception ; in their deceit they refuse to acknowledge me , ’ declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	7	Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty says : ‘ See , I will refine and test them , for what else can I do because of the sin of my people ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	8	Their tongue is a deadly arrow ; it speaks deceitfully . With their mouths they all speak cordially to their neighbours , but in their hearts they set traps for them .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	10	I will weep and wail for the mountains and take up a lament concerning the wilderness grasslands . They are desolate and untravelled , and the lowing of cattle is not heard . The birds have all fled and the animals are gone .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	11	‘ I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins , a haunt of jackals ; and I will lay waste the towns of Judah so that no one can live there. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	12	Who is wise enough to understand this ? Who has been instructed by the Lord and can explain it ? Why has the land been ruined and laid waste like a desert that no one can cross ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	13	The Lord said , ‘ It is because they have forsaken my law , which I set before them ; they have not obeyed me or followed my law .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	14	Instead , they have followed the stubbornness of their hearts ; they have followed the Baals , as their ancestors taught them. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	15	Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : ‘ See , I will make this people eat bitter food and drink poisoned water .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	16	I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have known , and I will pursue them with the sword until I have made an end of them. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	17	This is what the Lord Almighty says : ‘ Consider now ! Call for the wailing women to come ; send for the most skilful of them .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	18	Let them come quickly and wail over us till our eyes overflow with tears and water streams from our eyelids .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	19	The sound of wailing is heard from Zion : “ How ruined we are ! How great is our shame ! We must leave our land because our houses are in ruins. ” ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	20	Now , you women , hear the word of the Lord ; open your ears to the words of his mouth . Teach your daughters how to wail ; teach one another a lament .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	21	Death has climbed in through our windows and has entered our fortresses ; it has removed the children from the streets and the young men from the public squares .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	22	Say , ‘ This is what the Lord declares : ‘ “ Dead bodies will lie like dung on the open field , like cut corn behind the reaper , with no one to gather them. ” ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	23	This is what the Lord says : ‘ Let not the wise boast of their wisdom or the strong boast of their strength or the rich boast of their riches ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	24	but let the one who boasts boast about this : that they have the understanding to know me , that I am the Lord , who exercises kindness , justice and righteousness on earth , for in these I delight , ’ declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	25	‘ The days are coming , ’ declares the Lord , ‘ when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh –
NIVUK	Jeremiah	9	26	Egypt , Judah , Edom , Ammon , Moab and all who live in the wilderness in distant places . [ e ] For all these nations are really uncircumcised , and even the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart. ’ Footnotes - Jeremiah 9:1 In Hebrew texts 9:1 is numbered 8:23 , and 9:2-26 is numbered 9:1-25 . - Jeremiah 9:3 Or lies ; / they are not valiant for truth - Jeremiah 9:4 Or a deceiving Jacob - Jeremiah 9:6 That is , Jeremiah ( the Hebrew is singular ) - Jeremiah 9:26 Or wilderness and who clip the hair by their foreheads Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	10	But the Lord is the true God ; he is the living God , the eternal King . When he is angry , the earth trembles ; the nations can not endure his wrath .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	2	This is what the Lord says : ‘ Do not learn the ways of the nations or be terrified by signs in the heavens , though the nations are terrified by them .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	3	For the practices of the peoples are worthless ; they cut a tree out of the forest , and a craftsman shapes it with his chisel .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	4	They adorn it with silver and gold ; they fasten it with hammer and nails so that it will not totter .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	5	Like a scarecrow in a cucumber field , their idols can not speak ; they must be carried because they can not walk . Do not fear them ; they can do no harm nor can they do any good. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	6	No one is like you , Lord ; you are great , and your name is mighty in power .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	7	Who should not fear you , King of the nations ? This is your due . Among all the wise leaders of the nations and in all their kingdoms , there is no one like you .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	8	They are all senseless and foolish ; they are taught by worthless wooden idols .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	9	Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz . What the craftsman and goldsmith have made is then dressed in blue and purple – all made by skilled workers .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	11	‘ Tell them this : “ These gods , who did not make the heavens and the earth , will perish from the earth and from under the heavens. ” ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	12	But God made the earth by his power ; he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	13	When he thunders , the waters in the heavens roar ; he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth . He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	14	Everyone is senseless and without knowledge ; every goldsmith is shamed by his idols . The images he makes are a fraud ; they have no breath in them .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	15	They are worthless , the objects of mockery ; when their judgment comes , they will perish .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	16	He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these , for he is the Maker of all things , including Israel , the people of his inheritance – the Lord Almighty is his name . Coming destruction
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	17	Gather up your belongings to leave the land , you who live under siege .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	18	For this is what the Lord says : ‘ At this time I will hurl out those who live in this land ; I will bring distress on them so that they may be captured. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	19	Woe to me because of my injury ! My wound is incurable ! Yet I said to myself , ‘ This is my sickness , and I must endure it. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	20	My tent is destroyed ; all its ropes are snapped . My children are gone from me and are no more ; no one is left now to pitch my tent or to set up my shelter .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	21	The shepherds are senseless and do not enquire of the Lord ; so they do not prosper and all their flock is scattered .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	22	Listen ! The report is coming – a great commotion from the land of the north ! It will make the towns of Judah desolate , a haunt of jackals . Jeremiah ’ s prayer
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	23	Lord , I know that people ’ s lives are not their own ; it is not for them to direct their steps .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	24	Discipline me , Lord , but only in due measure – not in your anger , or you will reduce me to nothing .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	10	25	Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you , on the peoples who do not call on your name . For they have devoured Jacob ; they have devoured him completely and destroyed his homeland . Footnotes - Jeremiah 10:11 The text of this verse is in Aramaic .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	11	Therefore this is what the Lord says : “ I will bring on them a disaster they can not escape . Although they cry out to me , I will not listen to them .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	2	‘ Listen to the terms of this covenant and tell them to the people of Judah and to those who live in Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	3	Tell them that this is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : “ Cursed is the one who does not obey the terms of this covenant –
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	4	the terms I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt , out of the iron-smelting furnace. ” I said , “ Obey me and do everything I command you , and you will be my people , and I will be your God .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	5	Then I will fulfil the oath I swore to your ancestors , to give them a land flowing with milk and honey ” – the land you possess today. ’ I answered , ‘ Amen , Lord. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	6	The Lord said to me , ‘ Proclaim all these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem : “ Listen to the terms of this covenant and follow them .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	7	From the time I brought your ancestors up from Egypt until today , I warned them again and again , saying , ‘ Obey me. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	8	But they did not listen or pay attention ; instead , they followed the stubbornness of their evil hearts . So I brought on them all the curses of the covenant I had commanded them to follow but that they did not keep. ” ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	9	Then the Lord said to me , ‘ There is a conspiracy among the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	10	They have returned to the sins of their ancestors , who refused to listen to my words . They have followed other gods to serve them . Both Israel and Judah have broken the covenant I made with their ancestors .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	12	The towns of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense , but they will not help them at all when disaster strikes .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	13	You , Judah , have as many gods as you have towns ; and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	14	‘ Do not pray for this people or offer any plea or petition for them , because I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their distress .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	15	‘ What is my beloved doing in my temple as she , with many others , works out her evil schemes ? Can consecrated meat avert your punishment ? When you engage in your wickedness , then you rejoice. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	16	The Lord called you a thriving olive tree with fruit beautiful in form . But with the roar of a mighty storm he will set it on fire , and its branches will be broken .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	17	The Lord Almighty , who planted you , has decreed disaster for you , because the people of both Israel and Judah have done evil and aroused my anger by burning incense to Baal . Plot against Jeremiah
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	18	Because the Lord revealed their plot to me , I knew it , for at that time he showed me what they were doing .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	19	I had been like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter ; I did not realise that they had plotted against me , saying , ‘ Let us destroy the tree and its fruit ; let us cut him off from the land of the living , that his name be remembered no more. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	20	But you , Lord Almighty , who judge righteously and test the heart and mind , let me see your vengeance on them , for to you I have committed my cause .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	21	Therefore this is what the Lord says about the people of Anathoth who are threatening to kill you , saying , ‘ Do not prophesy in the name of the Lord or you will die by our hands ’ –
NIVUK	Jeremiah	11	22	therefore this is what the Lord Almighty says : ‘ I will punish them . Their young men will die by the sword , their sons and daughters by famine .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	12	12	Over all the barren heights in the desert destroyers will swarm , for the sword of the Lord will devour from one end of the land to the other ; no one will be safe .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	12	2	You have planted them , and they have taken root ; they grow and bear fruit . You are always on their lips but far from their hearts .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	12	3	Yet you know me , Lord ; you see me and test my thoughts about you . Drag them off like sheep to be butchered ! Set them apart for the day of slaughter !
NIVUK	Jeremiah	12	4	How long will the land lie parched and the grass in every field be withered ? Because those who live in it are wicked , the animals and birds have perished . Moreover , the people are saying , ‘ He will not see what happens to us. ’ God ’ s answer
NIVUK	Jeremiah	12	5	‘ If you have raced with men on foot and they have worn you out , how can you compete with horses ? If you stumble [ a ] in safe country , how will you manage in the thickets by [ b ] the Jordan ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	12	6	Your relatives , members of your own family – even they have betrayed you ; they have raised a loud cry against you . Do not trust them , though they speak well of you .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	12	7	‘ I will forsake my house , abandon my inheritance ; I will give the one I love into the hands of her enemies .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	12	8	My inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest . She roars at me ; therefore I hate her .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	12	9	Has not my inheritance become to me like a speckled bird of prey that other birds of prey surround and attack ? Go and gather all the wild beasts ; bring them to devour .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	12	10	Many shepherds will ruin my vineyard and trample down my field ; they will turn my pleasant field into a desolate wasteland .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	12	11	It will be made a wasteland , parched and desolate before me ; the whole land will be laid waste because there is no one who cares .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	12	13	They will sow wheat but reap thorns ; they will wear themselves out but gain nothing . They will bear the shame of their harvest because of the Lord ’ s fierce anger. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	12	14	This is what the Lord says : ‘ As for all my wicked neighbours who seize the inheritance I gave to my people Israel , I will uproot them from their lands and I will uproot the people of Judah from among them .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	12	15	But after I uproot them , I will again have compassion and will bring each of them back to their own inheritance and their own country .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	12	16	And if they learn well the ways of my people and swear by my name , saying , “ As surely as the Lord lives ” – even as they once taught my people to swear by Baal – then they will be established among my people .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	13	then tell them , “ This is what the Lord says : I am going to fill with drunkenness all who live in this land , including the kings who sit on David ’ s throne , the priests , the prophets and all those living in Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	2	So I bought a belt , as the Lord directed , and put it round my waist .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	3	Then the word of the Lord came to me a second time :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	4	‘ Take the belt you bought and are wearing round your waist , and go now to Perath [ a ] and hide it there in a crevice in the rocks. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	5	So I went and hid it at Perath , as the Lord told me .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	6	Many days later the Lord said to me , ‘ Go now to Perath and get the belt I told you to hide there. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	7	So I went to Perath and dug up the belt and took it from the place where I had hidden it , but now it was ruined and completely useless .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	8	Then the word of the Lord came to me :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	9	‘ This is what the Lord says : “ In the same way I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	10	These wicked people , who refuse to listen to my words , who follow the stubbornness of their hearts and go after other gods to serve and worship them , will be like this belt – completely useless !
NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	11	For as a belt is bound round the waist , so I bound all the people of Israel and all the people of Judah to me , ” declares the Lord , “ to be my people for my renown and praise and honour . But they have not listened. ” Wineskins
NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	12	‘ Say to them : “ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : every wineskin should be filled with wine. ” And if they say to you , “ Don ’ t we know that every wineskin should be filled with wine ? ”

NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	15	Hear and pay attention , do not be arrogant , for the Lord has spoken .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	16	Give glory to the Lord your God before he brings the darkness , before your feet stumble on the darkening hills . You hope for light , but he will turn it to utter darkness and change it to deep gloom .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	17	If you do not listen , I will weep in secret because of your pride ; my eyes will weep bitterly , overflowing with tears , because the Lord ’ s flock will be taken captive .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	18	Say to the king and to the queen mother , ‘ Come down from your thrones , for your glorious crowns will fall from your heads. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	19	The cities in the Negev will be shut up , and there will be no one to open them . All Judah will be carried into exile , carried completely away .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	20	Look up and see those who are coming from the north . Where is the flock that was entrusted to you , the sheep of which you boasted ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	13	21	What will you say when the Lord sets over you those you cultivated as your special allies ? Will not pain grip you like that of a woman in labour ?

NIVUK	Jeremiah	14	14	Then the Lord said to me , ‘ The prophets are prophesying lies in my name . I have not sent them or appointed them or spoken to them . They are prophesying to you false visions , divinations , idolatries [ a ] and the delusions of their own minds .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	14	2	‘ Judah mourns , her cities languish ; they wail for the land , and a cry goes up from Jerusalem .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	14	7	Although our sins testify against us , do something , Lord , for the sake of your name . For we have often rebelled ; we have sinned against you .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	14	8	You who are the hope of Israel , its Saviour in times of distress , why are you like a stranger in the land , like a traveller who stays only a night ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	14	9	Why are you like a man taken by surprise , like a warrior powerless to save ? You are among us , Lord , and we bear your name ; do not forsake us !
NIVUK	Jeremiah	14	10	This is what the Lord says about this people : ‘ They greatly love to wander ; they do not restrain their feet . So the Lord does not accept them ; he will now remember their wickedness and punish them for their sins. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	14	11	Then the Lord said to me , ‘ Do not pray for the well-being of this people .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	14	12	Although they fast , I will not listen to their cry ; though they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings , I will not accept them . Instead , I will destroy them with the sword , famine and plague. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	14	13	But I said , ‘ Alas , Sovereign Lord ! The prophets keep telling them , “ You will not see the sword or suffer famine . Indeed , I will give you lasting peace in this place. ” ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	14	15	Therefore this is what the Lord says about the prophets who are prophesying in my name : I did not send them , yet they are saying , “ No sword or famine will touch this land. ” Those same prophets will perish by sword and famine .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	14	16	And the people they are prophesying to will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and sword . There will be no one to bury them , their wives , their sons and their daughters . I will pour out on them the calamity they deserve .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	14	17	‘ Speak this word to them : ‘ “ Let my eyes overflow with tears night and day without ceasing ; for the Virgin Daughter , my people , has suffered a grievous wound , a crushing blow .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	14	18	If I go into the country , I see those slain by the sword ; if I go into the city , I see the ravages of famine . Both prophet and priest have gone to a land they know not. ” ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	14	19	Have you rejected Judah completely ? Do you despise Zion ? Why have you afflicted us so that we can not be healed ? We hoped for peace but no good has come , for a time of healing but there is only terror .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	14	20	We acknowledge our wickedness , Lord , and the guilt of our ancestors ; we have indeed sinned against you .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	14	21	For the sake of your name do not despise us ; do not dishonour your glorious throne . Remember your covenant with us and do not break it .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	14	22	Do any of the worthless idols of the nations bring rain ? Do the skies themselves send down showers ? No , it is you , Lord our God .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	16	‘ But now I will send for many fishermen , ’ declares the Lord , ‘ and they will catch them . After that I will send for many hunters , and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill and from the crevices of the rocks .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	2	‘ You must not marry and have sons or daughters in this place. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	3	For this is what the Lord says about the sons and daughters born in this land and about the women who are their mothers and the men who are their fathers :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	4	‘ They will die of deadly diseases . They will not be mourned or buried but will be like dung lying on the ground . They will perish by sword and famine , and their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	5	For this is what the Lord says : ‘ Do not enter a house where there is a funeral meal ; do not go to mourn or show sympathy , because I have withdrawn my blessing , my love and my pity from this people , ’ declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	6	‘ Both high and low will die in this land . They will not be buried or mourned , and no one will cut themselves or shave their head for the dead .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	7	No one will offer food to comfort those who mourn for the dead – not even for a father or a mother – nor will anyone give them a drink to console them .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	8	‘ And do not enter a house where there is feasting and sit down to eat and drink .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	9	For this is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : Before your eyes and in your days I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in this place .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	10	‘ When you tell these people all this and they ask you , “ Why has the Lord decreed such a great disaster against us ? What wrong have we done ? What sin have we committed against the Lord our God ? ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	11	then say to them , “ It is because your ancestors forsook me , ” declares the Lord , “ and followed other gods and served and worshipped them . They forsook me and did not keep my law .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	12	But you have behaved more wickedly than your ancestors . See how all of you are following the stubbornness of your evil hearts instead of obeying me .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	13	So I will throw you out of this land into a land neither you nor your ancestors have known , and there you will serve other gods day and night , for I will show you no favour. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	14	‘ However , the days are coming , ’ declares the Lord , ‘ when it will no longer be said , “ As surely as the Lord lives , who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt , ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	15	but it will be said , “ As surely as the Lord lives , who brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them. ” For I will restore them to the land I gave to their ancestors .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	17	My eyes are on all their ways ; they are not hidden from me , nor is their sin concealed from my eyes .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	18	I will repay them double for their wickedness and their sin , because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and have filled my inheritance with their detestable idols. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	19	Lord , my strength and my fortress , my refuge in time of distress , to you the nations will come from the ends of the earth and say , ‘ Our ancestors possessed nothing but false gods , worthless idols that did them no good .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	20	Do people make their own gods ? Yes , but they are not gods ! ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	16	21	‘ Therefore I will teach them – this time I will teach them my power and might . Then they will know that my name is the Lord . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	4	Through your own fault you will lose the inheritance I gave you . I will enslave you to your enemies in a land you do not know , for you have kindled my anger , and it will burn for ever. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	5	This is what the Lord says : ‘ Cursed is the one who trusts in man , who draws strength from mere flesh and whose heart turns away from the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	6	That person will be like a bush in the wastelands ; they will not see prosperity when it comes . They will dwell in the parched places of the desert , in a salt land where no one lives .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	7	‘ But blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord , whose confidence is in him .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	9	The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure . Who can understand it ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	10	‘ I the Lord search the heart and examine the mind , to reward each person according to their conduct , according to what their deeds deserve. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	11	Like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay are those who gain riches by unjust means . When their lives are half gone , their riches will desert them , and in the end they will prove to be fools .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	12	A glorious throne , exalted from the beginning , is the place of our sanctuary .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	13	Lord , you are the hope of Israel ; all who forsake you will be put to shame . Those who turn away from you will be written in the dust because they have forsaken the Lord , the spring of living water .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	14	Heal me , Lord , and I shall be healed ; save me and I shall be saved , for you are the one I praise .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	15	They keep saying to me , ‘ Where is the word of the Lord ? Let it now be fulfilled ! ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	16	I have not run away from being your shepherd ; you know I have not desired the day of despair . What passes my lips is open before you .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	18	Let my persecutors be put to shame , but keep me from shame ; let them be terrified , but keep me from terror . Bring on them the day of disaster ; destroy them with double destruction . Keeping the Sabbath holy
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	19	This is what the Lord said to me : ‘ Go and stand at the Gate of the People , [ c ] through which the kings of Judah go in and out ; stand also at all the other gates of Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	20	Say to them , “ Hear the word of the Lord , you kings of Judah and all people of Judah and everyone living in Jerusalem who come through these gates .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	21	This is what the Lord says : be careful not to carry a load on the Sabbath day or bring it through the gates of Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	22	Do not bring a load out of your houses or do any work on the Sabbath , but keep the Sabbath day holy , as I commanded your ancestors .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	23	Yet they did not listen or pay attention ; they were stiff-necked and would not listen or respond to discipline .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	24	But if you are careful to obey me , declares the Lord , and bring no load through the gates of this city on the Sabbath , but keep the Sabbath day holy by not doing any work on it ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	25	then kings who sit on David ’ s throne will come through the gates of this city with their officials . They and their officials will come riding in chariots and on horses , accompanied by the men of Judah and those living in Jerusalem , and this city will be inhabited for ever .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	26	People will come from the towns of Judah and the villages around Jerusalem , from the territory of Benjamin and the western foothills , from the hill country and the Negev , bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices , grain offerings and incense , and bringing thank-offerings to the house of the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	17	27	But if you do not obey me to keep the Sabbath day holy by not carrying any load as you come through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day , then I will kindle an unquenchable fire in the gates of Jerusalem that will consume her fortresses. ” ’ Footnotes - Jeremiah 17:2 That is , wooden symbols of the goddess Asherah - Jeremiah 17:3 Or hills /

NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	18	They said , ‘ Come , let ’ s make plans against Jeremiah ; for the teaching of the law by the priest will not cease , nor will counsel from the wise , nor the word from the prophets . So come , let ’ s attack him with our tongues and pay no attention to anything he says. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	2	‘ Go down to the potter ’ s house , and there I will give you my message. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	3	So I went down to the potter ’ s house , and I saw him working at the wheel .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	4	But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands ; so the potter formed it into another pot , shaping it as seemed best to him .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	5	Then the word of the Lord came to me .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	6	He said , ‘ Can I not do with you , Israel , as this potter does ? ’ declares the Lord . ‘ Like clay in the hand of the potter , so are you in my hand , Israel .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	7	If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted , torn down and destroyed ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	8	and if that nation I warned repents of its evil , then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	9	And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	10	and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me , then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	11	‘ Now therefore say to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem , “ This is what the Lord says : look ! I am preparing a disaster for you and devising a plan against you . So turn from your evil ways , each one of you , and reform your ways and your actions. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	12	But they will reply , “ It ’ s no use . We will continue with our own plans ; we will all follow the stubbornness of our evil hearts. ” ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	13	Therefore this is what the Lord says : ‘ Enquire among the nations : who has ever heard anything like this ? A most horrible thing has been done by Virgin Israel .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	14	Does the snow of Lebanon ever vanish from its rocky slopes ? Do its cool waters from distant sources ever stop flowing ? [ a ]
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	15	Yet my people have forgotten me ; they burn incense to worthless idols , which made them stumble in their ways , in the ancient paths . They made them walk in byways , on roads not built up .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	16	Their land will be an object of horror and of lasting scorn ; all who pass by will be appalled and will shake their heads .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	17	Like a wind from the east , I will scatter them before their enemies ; I will show them my back and not my face in the day of their disaster. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	19	Listen to me , Lord ; hear what my accusers are saying !
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	20	Should good be repaid with evil ? Yet they have dug a pit for me . Remember that I stood before you and spoke on their behalf to turn your wrath away from them .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	21	So give their children over to famine ; hand them over to the power of the sword . Let their wives be made childless and widows ; let their men be put to death , their young men slain by the sword in battle .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	22	Let a cry be heard from their houses when you suddenly bring invaders against them , for they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden snares for my feet .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	18	23	But you , Lord , know all their plots to kill me . Do not forgive their crimes or blot out their sins from your sight . Let them be overthrown before you ; deal with them in the time of your anger . Footnotes - Jeremiah 18:14 The meaning of the Hebrew for this sentence is uncertain .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	19	19	This is what the Lord says : ‘ Go and buy a clay jar from a potter . Take along some of the elders of the people and of the priests
NIVUK	Jeremiah	19	2	and go out to the Valley of Ben Hinnom , near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate . There proclaim the words I tell you ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	19	3	and say , “ Hear the word of the Lord , you kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem . This is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : listen ! I am going to bring a disaster on this place that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	19	4	For they have forsaken me and made this a place of foreign gods ; they have burned incense in it to gods that neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah ever knew , and they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	19	5	They have built the high places of Baal to burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal – something I did not command or mention , nor did it enter my mind .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	19	6	So beware , the days are coming , declares the Lord , when people will no longer call this place Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom , but the Valley of Slaughter .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	19	7	‘ “ In this place I will ruin [ a ] the plans of Judah and Jerusalem . I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies , at the hands of those who want to kill them , and I will give their carcasses as food to the birds and the wild animals .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	19	8	I will devastate this city and make it an object of horror and scorn ; all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff because of all its wounds .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	19	9	I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters , and they will eat one another ’ s flesh because their enemies will press the siege so hard against them to destroy them. ”

NIVUK	Jeremiah	19	11	and say to them , “ This is what the Lord Almighty says : I will smash this nation and this city just as this potter ’ s jar is smashed and can not be repaired . They will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	19	12	This is what I will do to this place and to those who live here , declares the Lord . I will make this city like Topheth .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	19	13	The houses in Jerusalem and those of the kings of Judah will be defiled like this place , Topheth – all the houses where they burned incense on the roofs to all the starry hosts and poured out drink offerings to other gods. ” ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	19	14	Jeremiah then returned from Topheth , where the Lord had sent him to prophesy , and stood in the court of the Lord ’ s temple and said to all the people ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	19	15	‘ This is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : “ Listen !

NIVUK	Jeremiah	20	20	When the priest Pashhur son of Immer , the official in charge of the temple of the Lord , heard Jeremiah prophesying these things ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	20	2	he had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put in the stocks at the Upper Gate of Benjamin at the Lord ’ s temple .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	20	3	The next day , when Pashhur released him from the stocks , Jeremiah said to him , ‘ The Lord ’ s name for you is not Pashhur , but Terror on Every Side .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	20	4	For this is what the Lord says : “ I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends ; with your own eyes you will see them fall by the sword of their enemies . I will give all Judah into the hands of the king of Babylon , who will carry them away to Babylon or put them to the sword .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	20	5	I will deliver all the wealth of this city into the hands of their enemies – all its products , all its valuables and all the treasures of the kings of Judah . They will take it away as plunder and carry it off to Babylon .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	20	6	And you , Pashhur , and all who live in your house will go into exile to Babylon . There you will die and be buried , you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies. ” ’ Jeremiah ’ s complaint
NIVUK	Jeremiah	20	7	You deceived [ a ] me , Lord , and I was deceived ; [ b ] you overpowered me and prevailed . I am ridiculed all day long ; everyone mocks me .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	20	8	Whenever I speak , I cry out proclaiming violence and destruction . So the word of the Lord has brought me insult and reproach all day long .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	20	9	But if I say , ‘ I will not mention his word or speak any more in his name , ’ his word is in my heart like a fire , a fire shut up in my bones . I am weary of holding it in ; indeed , I can not .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	20	10	I hear many whispering , ‘ Terror on every side ! Denounce him ! Let ’ s denounce him ! ’ All my friends are waiting for me to slip , saying , ‘ Perhaps he will be deceived ; then we will prevail over him and take our revenge on him. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	20	11	But the Lord is with me like a mighty warrior ; so my persecutors will stumble and not prevail . They will fail and be thoroughly disgraced ; their dishonour will never be forgotten .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	20	12	Lord Almighty , you who examine the righteous and probe the heart and mind , let me see your vengeance on them , for to you I have committed my cause .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	20	13	Sing to the Lord ! Give praise to the Lord ! He rescues the life of the needy from the hands of the wicked .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	20	14	Cursed be the day I was born ! May the day my mother bore me not be blessed !
NIVUK	Jeremiah	20	15	Cursed be the man who brought my father the news , who made him very glad , saying , ‘ A child is born to you – a son ! ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	20	16	May that man be like the towns the Lord overthrew without pity . May he hear wailing in the morning , a battle cry at noon .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	20	17	For he did not kill me in the womb , with my mother as my grave , her womb enlarged for ever .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	21	21	The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malkijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah . They said :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	21	2	‘ Enquire now of the Lord for us because Nebuchadnezzar [ a ] king of Babylon is attacking us . Perhaps the Lord will perform wonders for us as in times past so that he will withdraw from us. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	21	3	But Jeremiah answered them , ‘ Tell Zedekiah ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	21	4	“ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : I am about to turn against you the weapons of war that are in your hands , which you are using to fight the king of Babylon and the Babylonians [ b ] who are outside the wall besieging you .

He will put them to the sword ; he will show them no mercy or pity or compassion. ”

NIVUK	Jeremiah	22	4	For if you are careful to carry out these commands , then kings who sit on David ’ s throne will come through the gates of this palace , riding in chariots and on horses , accompanied by their officials and their people .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	22	5	But if you do not obey these commands , declares the Lord , I swear by myself that this palace will become a ruin. ” ’

NIVUK	Jeremiah	22	9	And the answer will be : “ Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God and have worshipped and served other gods. ” ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	22	10	Do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss ; rather , weep bitterly for him who is exiled , because he will never return nor see his native land again .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	22	11	For this is what the Lord says about Shallum [ a ] son of Josiah , who succeeded his father as king of Judah but has gone from this place : ‘ He will never return .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	22	15	‘ Does it make you a king to have more and more cedar ? Did not your father have food and drink ? He did what was right and just , so all went well with him .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	10	The land is full of adulterers ; because of the curse [ b ] the land lies parched and the pastures in the wilderness are withered . The prophets follow an evil course and use their power unjustly .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	11	‘ Both prophet and priest are godless ; even in my temple I find their wickedness , ’ declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	12	‘ Therefore their path will become slippery ; they will be banished to darkness and there they will fall . I will bring disaster on them in the year they are punished , ’ declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	13	‘ Among the prophets of Samaria I saw this repulsive thing : they prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	14	And among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen something horrible : they commit adultery and live a lie . They strengthen the hands of evildoers , so that not one of them turns from their wickedness . They are all like Sodom to me ; the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	15	Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty says concerning the prophets : ‘ I will make them eat bitter food and drink poisoned water , because from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has spread throughout the land. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	16	This is what the Lord Almighty says : ‘ Do not listen to what the prophets are prophesying to you ; they fill you with false hopes . They speak visions from their own minds , not from the mouth of the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	17	They keep saying to those who despise me , “ The Lord says : you will have peace. ” And to all who follow the stubbornness of their hearts they say , “ No harm will come to you. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	18	But which of them has stood in the council of the Lord to see or to hear his word ? Who has listened and heard his word ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	19	See , the storm of the Lord will burst out in wrath , a whirlwind swirling down on the heads of the wicked .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	20	The anger of the Lord will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart . In days to come you will understand it clearly .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	21	I did not send these prophets , yet they have run with their message ; I did not speak to them , yet they have prophesied .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	22	But if they had stood in my council , they would have proclaimed my words to my people and would have turned them from their evil ways and from their evil deeds .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	24	Who can hide in secret places so that I can not see them ? ’ declares the Lord . ‘ Do not I fill heaven and earth ? ’ declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	25	‘ I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name . They say , “ I had a dream ! I had a dream ! ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	26	How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets , who prophesy the delusions of their own minds ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	27	They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name , just as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	28	Let the prophet who has a dream recount the dream , but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully . For what has straw to do with grain ? ’ declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	29	‘ Is not my word like fire , ’ declares the Lord , ‘ and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	30	‘ Therefore , ’ declares the Lord , ‘ I am against the prophets who steal from one another words supposedly from me .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	31	Yes , ’ declares the Lord , ‘ I am against the prophets who wag their own tongues and yet declare , “ The Lord declares. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	32	Indeed , I am against those who prophesy false dreams , ’ declares the Lord . ‘ They tell them and lead my people astray with their reckless lies , yet I did not send or appoint them . They do not benefit these people in the least , ’ declares the Lord . False prophecy
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	33	‘ When these people , or a prophet or a priest , ask you , “ What is the message from the Lord ? ” say to them , “ What message ? I will forsake you , declares the Lord. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	34	If a prophet or a priest or anyone else claims , “ This is a message from the Lord , ” I will punish them and their household .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	35	This is what each of you keeps saying to your friends and other Israelites : “ What is the Lord ’ s answer ? ” or “ What has the Lord spoken ? ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	36	But you must not mention “ a message from the Lord ” again , because each one ’ s word becomes their own message . So you distort the words of the living God , the Lord Almighty , our God .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	37	This is what you keep saying to a prophet : “ What is the Lord ’ s answer to you ? ” or “ What has the Lord spoken ? ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	38	Although you claim , “ This is a message from the Lord , ” this is what the Lord says : you used the words , “ This is a message from the Lord , ” even though I told you that you must not claim , “ This is a message from the Lord. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	39	Therefore , I will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence along with the city I gave to you and your ancestors .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	23	40	I will bring on you everlasting disgrace – everlasting shame that will not be forgotten. ’ Footnotes - Jeremiah 23:5 Or up from David ’ s line - Jeremiah 23:10 Or because of these things Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Jeremiah	24	24	After Jehoiachin [ a ] son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and the officials , the skilled workers and the craftsmen of Judah were carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , the Lord showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple of the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	24	2	One basket had very good figs , like those that ripen early ; the other basket had very bad figs , so bad that they could not be eaten .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	24	3	Then the Lord asked me , ‘ What do you see , Jeremiah ? ’ ‘ Figs , ’ I answered . ‘ The good ones are very good , but the bad ones are so bad that they can not be eaten. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	24	4	Then the word of the Lord came to me :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	24	5	‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : “ Like these good figs , I regard as good the exiles from Judah , whom I sent away from this place to the land of the Babylonians . [ b ]
NIVUK	Jeremiah	24	6	My eyes will watch over them for their good , and I will bring them back to this land . I will build them up and not tear them down ; I will plant them and not uproot them .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	24	7	I will give them a heart to know me , that I am the Lord . They will be my people , and I will be their God , for they will return to me with all their heart .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	24	8	‘ “ But like the bad figs , which are so bad that they can not be eaten , ” says the Lord , “ so will I deal with Zedekiah king of Judah , his officials and the survivors from Jerusalem , whether they remain in this land or live in Egypt .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	24	9	I will make them abhorrent and an offence to all the kingdoms of the earth , a reproach and a byword , a curse [ c ] and an object of ridicule , wherever I banish them .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	25	all the kings of Zimri , Elam and Media ;
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	2	So Jeremiah the prophet said to all the people of Judah and to all those living in Jerusalem :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	3	For twenty-three years – from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah until this very day – the word of the Lord has come to me and I have spoken to you again and again , but you have not listened .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	4	And though the Lord has sent all his servants the prophets to you again and again , you have not listened or paid any attention .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	5	They said , ‘ Turn now , each of you , from your evil ways and your evil practices , and you can stay in the land the Lord gave to you and your ancestors for ever and ever .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	6	Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them ; do not arouse my anger with what your hands have made . Then I will not harm you. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	7	‘ But you did not listen to me , ’ declares the Lord , ‘ and you have aroused my anger with what your hands have made , and you have brought harm to yourselves. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	8	Therefore the Lord Almighty says this : ‘ Because you have not listened to my words ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	9	I will summon all the peoples of the north and my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , ’ declares the Lord , ‘ and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants and against all the surrounding nations . I will completely destroy [ a ] them and make them an object of horror and scorn , and an everlasting ruin .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	10	I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness , the voices of bride and bridegroom , the sound of millstones and the light of the lamp .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	11	This whole country will become a desolate wasteland , and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	12	‘ But when the seventy years are fulfilled , I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation , the land of the Babylonians , [ b ] for their guilt , ’ declares the Lord , ‘ and will make it desolate for ever .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	13	I will bring on that land all the things I have spoken against it , all that are written in this book and prophesied by Jeremiah against all the nations .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	14	They themselves will be enslaved by many nations and great kings ; I will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands. ’ The cup of God ’ s wrath
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	15	This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , said to me : ‘ Take from my hand this cup filled with the wine of my wrath and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	16	When they drink it , they will stagger and go mad because of the sword I will send among them. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	17	So I took the cup from the Lord ’ s hand and made all the nations to whom he sent me drink it :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	18	Jerusalem and the towns of Judah , its kings and officials , to make them a ruin and an object of horror and scorn , a curse [ c ] – as they are today ;
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	19	Pharaoh king of Egypt , his attendants , his officials and all his people ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	20	and all the foreign people there ; all the kings of Uz ; all the kings of the Philistines ( those of Ashkelon , Gaza , Ekron , and the people left at Ashdod ) ;
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	21	Edom , Moab and Ammon ;

NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	26	and all the kings of the north , near and far , one after the other – all the kingdoms on the face of the earth . And after all of them , the king of Sheshak [ e ] will drink it too .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	27	‘ Then tell them , “ This is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : drink , get drunk and vomit , and fall to rise no more because of the sword I will send among you. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	28	But if they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink , tell them , “ This is what the Lord Almighty says : You must drink it !
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	29	See , I am beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears my Name , and will you indeed go unpunished ? You will not go unpunished , for I am calling down a sword on all who live on the earth , declares the Lord Almighty. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	30	‘ Now prophesy all these words against them and say to them : ‘ “ The Lord will roar from on high ; he will thunder from his holy dwelling and roar mightily against his land . He will shout like those who tread the grapes , shout against all who live on the earth .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	32	This is what the Lord Almighty says : ‘ Look ! Disaster is spreading from nation to nation ; a mighty storm is rising from the ends of the earth. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	25	33	At that time those slain by the Lord will be everywhere – from one end of the earth to the other . They will not be mourned or gathered up or buried , but will be like dung lying on the ground .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	26	Early in the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah , this word came from the Lord :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	2	‘ This is what the Lord says : Stand in the courtyard of the Lord ’ s house and speak to all the people of the towns of Judah who come to worship in the house of the Lord . Tell them everything I command you ; do not omit a word .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	3	Perhaps they will listen and each will turn from their evil ways . Then I will relent and not inflict on them the disaster I was planning because of the evil they have done .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	4	Say to them , “ This is what the Lord says : if you do not listen to me and follow my law , which I have set before you ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	5	and if you do not listen to the words of my servants the prophets , whom I have sent to you again and again ( though you have not listened ) ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	6	then I will make this house like Shiloh and this city a curse [ a ] among all the nations of the earth. ” ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	7	The priests , the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speak these words in the house of the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	8	But as soon as Jeremiah finished telling all the people everything the Lord had commanded him to say , the priests , the prophets and all the people seized him and said , ‘ You must die !
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	9	Why do you prophesy in the Lord ’ s name that this house will be like Shiloh and this city will be desolate and deserted ? ’ And all the people crowded around Jeremiah in the house of the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	10	When the officials of Judah heard about these things , they went up from the royal palace to the house of the Lord and took their places at the entrance of the New Gate of the Lord ’ s house .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	11	Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and all the people , ‘ This man should be sentenced to death because he has prophesied against this city . You have heard it with your own ears ! ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	12	Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and all the people : ‘ The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the things you have heard .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	13	Now reform your ways and your actions and obey the Lord your God . Then the Lord will relent and not bring the disaster he has pronounced against you .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	14	As for me , I am in your hands ; do with me whatever you think is good and right .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	15	Be assured , however , that if you put me to death , you will bring the guilt of innocent blood on yourselves and on this city and on those who live in it , for in truth the Lord has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	16	Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets , ‘ This man should not be sentenced to death ! He has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	17	Some of the elders of the land stepped forward and said to the entire assembly of people ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	18	‘ Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah . He told all the people of Judah , “ This is what the Lord Almighty says : ‘ “ Zion will be ploughed like a field , Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble , the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets. ” [ b ]
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	19	‘ Did Hezekiah king of Judah or anyone else in Judah put him to death ? Did not Hezekiah fear the Lord and seek his favour ? And did not the Lord relent , so that he did not bring the disaster he pronounced against them ? We are about to bring a terrible disaster on ourselves ! ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	20	( Now Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim was another man who prophesied in the name of the Lord ; he prophesied the same things against this city and this land as Jeremiah did .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	21	When King Jehoiakim and all his officers and officials heard his words , the king was determined to put him to death . But Uriah heard of it and fled in fear to Egypt .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	22	King Jehoiakim , however , sent Elnathan son of Akbor to Egypt , along with some other men .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	26	23	They brought Uriah out of Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim , who had him struck down with a sword and his body thrown into the burial place of the common people . )

NIVUK	Jeremiah	27	27	Early in the reign of Zedekiah [ a ] son of Josiah king of Judah , this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord :

NIVUK	Jeremiah	27	13	Why will you and your people die by the sword , famine and plague with which the Lord has threatened any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon ?

NIVUK	Jeremiah	28	28	In the fifth month of that same year , the fourth year , early in the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur , who was from Gibeon , said to me in the house of the Lord in the presence of the priests and all the people :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	28	2	‘ This is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : “ I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	28	7	Nevertheless , listen to what I have to say in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	28	8	from early times the prophets who preceded you and me have prophesied war , disaster and plague against many countries and great kingdoms .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	28	9	But the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognised as one truly sent by the Lord only if his prediction comes true. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	28	10	Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	28	11	and he said before all the people , ‘ This is what the Lord says : “ In the same way I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the neck of all the nations within two years. ” ’ At this , the prophet Jeremiah went on his way .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	28	12	After the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah , the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	28	13	‘ Go and tell Hananiah , “ This is what the Lord says : you have broken a wooden yoke , but in its place you will get a yoke of iron .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	30	30	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	30	2	‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : “ Write in a book all the words I have spoken to you .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	30	3	The days are coming , ” declares the Lord , “ when I will bring my people Israel and Judah back from captivity [ a ] and restore them to the land I gave to their ancestors to possess , ” says the Lord. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	30	4	These are the words the Lord spoke concerning Israel and Judah :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	30	5	‘ This is what the Lord says : ‘ “ Cries of fear are heard – terror , not peace .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	30	6	Ask and see : can a man bear children ? Then why do I see every strong man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labour , every face turned deathly pale ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	30	7	How awful that day will be ! No other will be like it . It will be a time of trouble for Jacob , but he will be saved out of it .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	30	8	‘ “ In that day , ” declares the Lord Almighty , “ I will break the yoke off their necks and will tear off their bonds ; no longer will foreigners enslave them .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	30	12	‘ This is what the Lord says : ‘ “ Your wound is incurable , your injury beyond healing .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	30	13	There is no one to plead your cause , no remedy for your sore , no healing for you .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	30	14	All your allies have forgotten you ; they care nothing for you . I have struck you as an enemy would and punished you as would the cruel , because your guilt is so great and your sins so many .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	30	15	Why do you cry out over your wound , your pain that has no cure ? Because of your great guilt and many sins I have done these things to you .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	30	16	‘ “ But all who devour you will be devoured ; all your enemies will go into exile . Those who plunder you will be plundered ; all who make spoil of you I will despoil .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	31	9	They will come with weeping ; they will pray as I bring them back . I will lead them beside streams of water on a level path where they will not stumble , because I am Israel ’ s father , and Ephraim is my firstborn son .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	31	10	‘ Hear the word of the Lord , you nations ; proclaim it in distant coastlands : “ He who scattered Israel will gather them and will watch over his flock like a shepherd. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	31	11	For the Lord will deliver Jacob and redeem them from the hand of those stronger than they .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	31	12	They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion ; they will rejoice in the bounty of the Lord – the grain , the new wine and the olive oil , the young of the flocks and herds . They will be like a well-watered garden , and they will sorrow no more .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	31	32	It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt , because they broke my covenant , though I was a husband to [ d ] them , ’ [ e ] declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	31	33	‘ This is the covenant that I will make with the people of Israel after that time , ’ declares the Lord . ‘ I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts . I will be their God , and they will be my people .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	32	The people of Israel and Judah have provoked me by all the evil they have done – they , their kings and officials , their priests and prophets , the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	2	The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem , and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace of Judah .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	3	Now Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him there , saying , ‘ Why do you prophesy as you do ? You say , “ This is what the Lord says : I am about to give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon , and he will capture it .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	6	Jeremiah said , ‘ The word of the Lord came to me :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	7	Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is going to come to you and say , “ Buy my field at Anathoth , because as nearest relative it is your right and duty to buy it. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	8	‘ Then , just as the Lord had said , my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard and said , “ Buy my field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin . Since it is your right to redeem it and possess it , buy it for yourself. ” ‘ I knew that this was the word of the Lord ;
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	9	so I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel and weighed out for him seventeen shekels [ b ] of silver .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	10	I signed and sealed the deed , had it witnessed , and weighed out the silver on the scales .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	11	I took the deed of purchase – the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions , as well as the unsealed copy –
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	12	and I gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah , the son of Mahseiah , in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed the deed and of all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	13	‘ In their presence I gave Baruch these instructions :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	14	“ This is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : take these documents , both the sealed and unsealed copies of the deed of purchase , and put them in a clay jar so that they will last a long time .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	15	For this is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : houses , fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	16	‘ After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah , I prayed to the Lord :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	17	‘ Ah , Sovereign Lord , you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm . Nothing is too hard for you .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	18	You show love to thousands but bring the punishment for the parents ’ sins into the laps of their children after them . Great and mighty God , whose name is the Lord Almighty ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	19	great are your purposes and mighty are your deeds . Your eyes are open to the ways of all mankind ; you reward each person according to their conduct and as their deeds deserve .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	20	You performed signs and wonders in Egypt and have continued them to this day , in Israel and among all mankind , and have gained the renown that is still yours .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	21	You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders , by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	22	You gave them this land you had sworn to give to their ancestors , a land flowing with milk and honey .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	23	They came in and took possession of it , but they did not obey you or follow your law ; they did not do what you commanded them to do . So you brought all this disaster on them .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	24	,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	25	,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	26	Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	27	‘ I am the Lord , the God of all mankind . Is anything too hard for me ?

NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	31	From the day it was built until now , this city has so aroused my anger and wrath that I must remove it from my sight .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	33	They turned their backs to me and not their faces ; though I taught them again and again , they would not listen or respond to discipline .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	34	They set up their vile images in the house that bears my Name and defiled it .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	35	They built high places for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molek , though I never commanded – nor did it enter my mind – that they should do such a detestable thing and so make Judah sin .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	32	36	‘ You are saying about this city , “ By the sword , famine and plague it will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon ” ; but this is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says :

NIVUK	Jeremiah	33	3	“ Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	33	4	For this is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says about the houses in this city and the royal palaces of Judah that have been torn down to be used against the siege ramps and the sword
NIVUK	Jeremiah	33	5	in the fight with the Babylonians [ a ] : “ They will be filled with the dead bodies of the people I will slay in my anger and wrath . I will hide my face from this city because of all its wickedness .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	33	6	‘ “ Nevertheless , I will bring health and healing to it ; I will heal my people and will let them enjoy abundant peace and security .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	33	9	Then this city will bring me renown , joy , praise and honour before all nations on earth that hear of all the good things I do for it ; and they will be in awe and will tremble at the abundant prosperity and peace I provide for it. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	33	10	‘ This is what the Lord says : “ You say about this place , ‘ It is a desolate waste , without people or animals. ’ Yet in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are deserted , inhabited by neither people nor animals , there will be heard once more
NIVUK	Jeremiah	33	11	the sounds of joy and gladness , the voices of bride and bridegroom , and the voices of those who bring thank offerings to the house of the Lord , saying , ‘ Give thanks to the Lord Almighty , for the Lord is good ; his love endures for ever. ’ For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were before , ” says the Lord .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	33	16	In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety . This is the name by which it [ c ] will be called : The Lord Our Righteous Saviour. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	33	17	For this is what the Lord says : “ David will never fail to have a man to sit on the throne of Israel ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	33	18	nor will the Levitical priests ever fail to have a man to stand before me continually to offer burnt offerings , to burn grain offerings and to present sacrifices. ” ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	33	19	The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	33	20	‘ This is what the Lord says : “ If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night , so that day and night no longer come at their appointed time ,

NIVUK	Jeremiah	33	22	I will make the descendants of David my servant and the Levites who minister before me as countless as the stars in the sky and as measureless as the sand on the seashore. ” ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	33	23	The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	33	24	‘ Have you not noticed that these people are saying , “ The Lord has rejected the two kingdoms [ d ] he chose ” ? So they despise my people and no longer regard them as a nation .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	33	25	This is what the Lord says : “ If I have not made my covenant with day and night and established the laws of heaven and earth ,

NIVUK	Jeremiah	34	34	While Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms and peoples in the empire he ruled were fighting against Jerusalem and all its surrounding towns , this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	34	2	‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : go to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him , “ This is what the Lord says : I am about to give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon , and he will burn it down .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	34	8	The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	34	9	Everyone was to free their Hebrew slaves , both male and female ; no one was to hold a fellow Hebrew in bondage .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	34	10	So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage . They agreed , and set them free .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	34	11	But afterwards they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	34	12	Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	34	13	‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt , out of the land of slavery . I said ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	34	14	“ Every seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you . After they have served you for six years , you must let them go free. ” [ a ] Your ancestors , however , did not listen to me or pay attention to me .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	34	15	Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight : each of you proclaimed freedom to your own people . You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	34	16	But now you have turned round and profaned my name ; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished . You have forced them to become your slaves again .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	34	17	‘ Therefore this is what the Lord says : you have not obeyed me ; you have not proclaimed freedom to your own people . So I now proclaim “ freedom ” for you , declares the Lord – “ freedom ” to fall by the sword , plague and famine . I will make you abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	34	18	Those who have violated my covenant and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before me , I will treat like the calf they cut in two and then walked between its pieces .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	34	19	The leaders of Judah and Jerusalem , the court officials , the priests and all the people of the land who walked between the pieces of the calf ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	34	20	I will deliver into the hands of their enemies who want to kill them . Their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	34	21	‘ I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials into the hands of their enemies who want to kill them , to the army of the king of Babylon , which has withdrawn from you .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	34	22	I am going to give the order , declares the Lord , and I will bring them back to this city . They will fight against it , take it and burn it down . And I will lay waste the towns of Judah so that no one can live there. ’ Footnotes - Jeremiah 34:14 Deut . 15:12 Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	35	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord during the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	2	‘ Go to the Rekabite family and invite them to come to one of the side rooms of the house of the Lord and give them wine to drink. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	3	So I went to get Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah , the son of Habazziniah , and his brothers and all his sons – the whole family of the Rekabites .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	4	I brought them into the house of the Lord , into the room of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah the man of God . It was next to the room of the officials , which was over that of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	5	Then I set bowls full of wine and some cups before the Rekabites and said to them , ‘ Drink some wine. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	6	But they replied , ‘ We do not drink wine , because our forefather Jehonadab [ a ] son of Rekab gave us this command : “ Neither you nor your descendants must ever drink wine .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	7	Also you must never build houses , sow seed or plant vineyards ; you must never have any of these things , but must always live in tents . Then you will live a long time in the land where you are nomads. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	8	We have obeyed everything our forefather Jehonadab son of Rekab commanded us . Neither we nor our wives nor our sons and daughters have ever drunk wine
NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	9	or built houses to live in or had vineyards , fields or crops .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	10	We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed everything our forefather Jehonadab commanded us .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	11	But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded this land , we said , “ Come , we must go to Jerusalem to escape the Babylonian [ b ] and Aramean armies. ” So we have remained in Jerusalem. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	12	Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah , saying :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	13	‘ This is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : go and tell the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem , “ Will you not learn a lesson and obey my words ? ” declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	14	“ Jehonadab son of Rekab ordered his descendants not to drink wine and this command has been kept . To this day they do not drink wine , because they obey their forefather ’ s command . But I have spoken to you again and again , yet you have not obeyed me .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	15	Again and again I sent all my servants the prophets to you . They said , ‘ Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions ; do not follow other gods to serve them . Then you shall live in the land I have given to you and your ancestors. ’ But you have not paid attention or listened to me .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	16	The descendants of Jehonadab son of Rekab have carried out the command their forefather gave them , but these people have not obeyed me. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	17	‘ Therefore this is what the Lord God Almighty , the God of Israel , says : “ Listen ! I am going to bring on Judah and on everyone living in Jerusalem every disaster I pronounced against them . I spoke to them , but they did not listen ; I called to them , but they did not answer. ” ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	18	Then Jeremiah said to the family of the Rekabites , ‘ This is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : “ You have obeyed the command of your forefather Jehonadab and have followed all his instructions and have done everything he ordered. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	35	19	Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : “ Jehonadab son of Rekab shall never fail to have a descendant to serve me. ” ’ Footnotes - Jeremiah 35:6 Hebrew Jonadab , a variant of Jehonadab ; here and often in this chapter - Jeremiah 35:11 Or Chaldean Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	36	In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah , this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	2	‘ Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel , Judah and all the other nations from the time I began speaking to you in the reign of Josiah till now .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	3	Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about every disaster I plan to inflict on them , they will each turn from their wicked ways ; then I will forgive their wickedness and their sin. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	4	So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah , and while Jeremiah dictated all the words the Lord had spoken to him , Baruch wrote them on the scroll .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	5	Then Jeremiah told Baruch , ‘ I am restricted ; I am not allowed to go to the Lord ’ s temple .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	6	So you go to the house of the Lord on a day of fasting and read to the people from the scroll the words of the Lord that you wrote as I dictated . Read them to all the people of Judah who come in from their towns .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	7	Perhaps they will bring their petition before the Lord and will each turn from their wicked ways , for the anger and wrath pronounced against this people by the Lord are great. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	8	Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do ; at the Lord ’ s temple he read the words of the Lord from the scroll .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	9	In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah , a time of fasting before the Lord was proclaimed for all the people in Jerusalem and those who had come from the towns of Judah .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	10	From the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary , which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple , Baruch read to all the people at the Lord ’ s temple the words of Jeremiah from the scroll .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	11	When Micaiah son of Gemariah , the son of Shaphan , heard all the words of the Lord from the scroll ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	12	he went down to the secretary ’ s room in the royal palace , where all the officials were sitting : Elishama the secretary , Delaiah son of Shemaiah , Elnathan son of Akbor , Gemariah son of Shaphan , Zedekiah son of Hananiah , and all the other officials .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	13	After Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	14	all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah , the son of Shelemiah , the son of Cushi , to say to Baruch , ‘ Bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come. ’ So Baruch son of Neriah went to them with the scroll in his hand .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	15	They said to him , ‘ Sit down , please , and read it to us. ’ So Baruch read it to them .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	16	When they heard all these words , they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch , ‘ We must report all these words to the king. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	17	Then they asked Baruch , ‘ Tell us , how did you come to write all this ? Did Jeremiah dictate it ? ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	18	‘ Yes , ’ Baruch replied , ‘ he dictated all these words to me , and I wrote them in ink on the scroll. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	19	Then the officials said to Baruch , ‘ You and Jeremiah , go and hide . Don ’ t let anyone know where you are. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	20	After they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary , they went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	21	The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll , and Jehudi brought it from the room of Elishama the secretary and read it to the king and all the officials standing beside him .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	22	It was the ninth month and the king was sitting in the winter apartment , with a fire burning in the brazier in front of him .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	23	Whenever Jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll , the king cut them off with a scribe ’ s knife and threw them into the brazier , until the entire scroll was burned in the fire .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	24	The king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no fear , nor did they tear their clothes .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	25	Even though Elnathan , Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll , he would not listen to them .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	26	Instead , the king commanded Jerahmeel , a son of the king , Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet . But the Lord had hidden them .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	27	After the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah ’ s dictation , the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	28	‘ Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll , which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	29	Also tell Jehoiakim king of Judah , “ This is what the Lord says : you burned that scroll and said , ‘ Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon would certainly come and destroy this land and wipe from it both man and beast ? ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	30	Therefore this is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim king of Judah : he will have no one to sit on the throne of David ; his body will be thrown out and exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	31	I will punish him and his children and his attendants for their wickedness ; I will bring on them and those living in Jerusalem and the people of Judah every disaster I pronounced against them , because they have not listened. ” ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	36	32	So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah , and as Jeremiah dictated , Baruch wrote on it all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire . And many similar words were added to them . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Jeremiah	37	37	Zedekiah son of Josiah was made king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ; he reigned in place of Jehoiachin [ a ] son of Jehoiakim .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	37	2	Neither he nor his attendants nor the people of the land paid any attention to the words the Lord had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	37	3	King Zedekiah , however , sent Jehukal son of Shelemiah with the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah the prophet with this message : ‘ Please pray to the Lord our God for us. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	37	4	Now Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people , for he had not yet been put in prison .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	37	5	Pharaoh ’ s army had marched out of Egypt , and when the Babylonians [ b ] who were besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them , they withdrew from Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	37	6	Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	37	7	‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : tell the king of Judah , who sent you to enquire of me , “ Pharaoh ’ s army , which has marched out to support you , will go back to its own land , to Egypt .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	37	13	and
NIVUK	Jeremiah	37	14	- Jeremiah 37:10 Or Chaldean ; also in verse
NIVUK	Jeremiah	37	15	They were angry with Jeremiah and had him beaten and imprisoned in the house of Jonathan the secretary , which they had made into a prison .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	37	16	Jeremiah was put into a vaulted cell in a dungeon , where he remained a long time .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	37	17	Then King Zedekiah sent for him and had him brought to the palace , where he asked him privately , ‘ Is there any word from the Lord ? ’ ‘ Yes , ’ Jeremiah replied , ‘ you will be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	37	18	Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah , ‘ What crime have I committed against you or your attendants or this people , that you have put me in prison ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	37	19	Where are your prophets who prophesied to you , “ The king of Babylon will not attack you or this land ” ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	37	20	But now , my lord the king , please listen . Let me bring my petition before you : do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary , or I shall die there. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	37	21	King Zedekiah then gave orders for Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given a loaf of bread from the street of the bakers each day until all the bread in the city was gone . So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard . Footnotes - Jeremiah 37:1 Hebrew Koniah , a variant of Jehoiachin - Jeremiah 37:5 Or Chaldeans ; also in verses

NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	38	Shephatiah son of Mattan , Gedaliah son of Pashhur , Jehukal [ a ] son of Shelemiah , and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard what Jeremiah was telling all the people when he said ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	2	‘ This is what the Lord says : “ Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword , famine or plague , but whoever goes over to the Babylonians [ b ] will live . They will escape with their lives ; they will live. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	3	And this is what the Lord says : “ This city will certainly be given into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon , who will capture it. ” ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	4	Then the officials said to the king , ‘ This man should be put to death . He is discouraging the soldiers who are left in this city , as well as all the people , by the things he is saying to them . This man is not seeking the good of these people but their ruin. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	5	‘ He is in your hands , ’ King Zedekiah answered . ‘ The king can do nothing to oppose you. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	6	So they took Jeremiah and put him into the cistern of Malkijah , the king ’ s son , which was in the courtyard of the guard . They lowered Jeremiah by ropes into the cistern ; it had no water in it , only mud , and Jeremiah sank down into the mud .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	7	But Ebed-Melek , a Cushite , [ c ] an official [ d ] in the royal palace , heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern . While the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	8	Ebed-Melek went out of the palace and said to him ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	9	‘ My lord the king , these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet . They have thrown him into a cistern , where he will starve to death when there is no longer any bread in the city. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	10	Then the king commanded Ebed-Melek the Cushite , ‘ Take thirty men from here with you and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	11	So Ebed-Melek took the men with him and went to a room under the treasury in the palace . He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from there and let them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	12	Ebed-Melek the Cushite said to Jeremiah , ‘ Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms to pad the ropes. ’ Jeremiah did so ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	13	and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern . And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard . Zedekiah questions Jeremiah again
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	14	Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to the third entrance to the temple of the Lord . ‘ I am going to ask you something , ’ the king said to Jeremiah . ‘ Do not hide anything from me. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	15	Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , ‘ If I give you an answer , will you not kill me ? Even if I did give you counsel , you would not listen to me. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	16	But King Zedekiah swore this oath secretly to Jeremiah : ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , who has given us breath , I will neither kill you nor hand you over to those who want to kill you. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	17	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , ‘ This is what the Lord God Almighty , the God of Israel , says : “ If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon , your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down ; you and your family will live .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	18	,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	19	and
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	20	‘ They will not hand you over , ’ Jeremiah replied . ‘ Obey the Lord by doing what I tell you . Then it will go well with you , and your life will be spared .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	21	But if you refuse to surrender , this is what the Lord has revealed to me :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	38	22	all the women left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon . Those women will say to you : ‘ “ They misled you and overcame you – those trusted friends of yours . Your feet are sunk in the mud ; your friends have deserted you. ”

NIVUK	Jeremiah	39	2	And on the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah ’ s eleventh year , the city wall was broken through .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	39	5	But the Babylonian [ b ] army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho . They captured him and took him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath , where he pronounced sentence on him .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	39	6	There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes and also killed all the nobles of Judah .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	39	7	Then he put out Zedekiah ’ s eyes and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to Babylon .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	39	8	The Babylonians [ c ] set fire to the royal palace and the houses of the people and broke down the walls of Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	39	9	Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard carried into exile to Babylon the people who remained in the city , along with those who had gone over to him , and the rest of the people .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	39	10	But Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard left behind in the land of Judah some of the poor people , who owned nothing ; and at that time he gave them vineyards and fields .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	39	15	While Jeremiah had been confined in the courtyard of the guard , the word of the Lord came to him :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	39	16	‘ Go and tell Ebed-Melek the Cushite , “ This is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : I am about to fulfil my words against this city – words concerning disaster , not prosperity . At that time they will be fulfilled before your eyes .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	39	17	But I will rescue you on that day , declares the Lord ; you will not be given into the hands of those you fear .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	40	40	The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had released him at Ramah . He had found Jeremiah bound in chains among all the captives from Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried into exile to Babylon .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	40	3	And now the Lord has brought it about ; he has done just as he said he would . All this happened because you people sinned against the Lord and did not obey him .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	40	5	However , before Jeremiah turned to go , [ a ] Nebuzaradan added , ‘ Go back to Gedaliah son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the towns of Judah , and live with him among the people , or go anywhere else you please. ’ Then the commander gave him provisions and a present and let him go .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	41	41	In the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , who was of royal blood and had been one of the king ’ s officers , came with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah . While they were eating together there ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	41	2	Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , with the sword , killing the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	41	3	Ishmael also killed all the men of Judah who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah , as well as the Babylonian [ a ] soldiers who were there .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	41	4	The day after Gedaliah ’ s assassination , before anyone knew about it ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	41	5	eighty men who had shaved off their beards , torn their clothes and cut themselves came from Shechem , Shiloh and Samaria , bringing grain offerings and incense with them to the house of the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	41	6	Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them , weeping as he went . When he met them , he said , ‘ Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	41	7	When they went into the city , Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	41	8	But ten of them said to Ishmael , ‘ Don ’ t kill us ! We have wheat and barley , olive oil and honey , hidden in a field. ’ So he let them alone and did not kill them with the others .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	41	9	Now the cistern where he threw all the bodies of the men he had killed along with Gedaliah was the one King Asa had made as part of his defence against Baasha king of Israel . Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the dead .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	41	10	Ishmael made captives of all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah – the king ’ s daughters along with all the others who were left there , over whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam . Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	41	11	When Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the crimes Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	41	12	they took all their men and went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah . They caught up with him near the great pool in Gibeon .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	41	13	When all the people Ishmael had with him saw Johanan son of Kareah and the army officers who were with him , they were glad .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	41	14	All the people Ishmael had taken captive at Mizpah turned and went over to Johanan son of Kareah .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	41	15	But Ishmael son of Nethaniah and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and fled to the Ammonites . Flight to Egypt
NIVUK	Jeremiah	41	16	Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him led away all the people of Mizpah who had survived , whom Johanan had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after Ishmael had assassinated Gedaliah son of Ahikam – the soldiers , women , children and court officials he had recovered from Gibeon .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	41	17	And they went on , stopping at Geruth Kimham near Bethlehem on their way to Egypt
NIVUK	Jeremiah	41	18	to escape the Babylonians . [ b ] They were afraid of them because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam , whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	42	Then all the army officers , including Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah [ a ] son of Hoshaiah , and all the people from the least to the greatest approached
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	2	Jeremiah the prophet and said to him , ‘ Please hear our petition and pray to the Lord your God for this entire remnant . For as you now see , though we were once many , now only a few are left .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	3	Pray that the Lord your God will tell us where we should go and what we should do. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	4	‘ I have heard you , ’ replied Jeremiah the prophet . ‘ I will certainly pray to the Lord your God as you have requested ; I will tell you everything the Lord says and will keep nothing back from you. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	5	Then they said to Jeremiah , ‘ May the Lord be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act in accordance with everything the Lord your God sends you to tell us .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	6	Whether it is favourable or unfavourable , we will obey the Lord our God , to whom we are sending you , so that it will go well with us , for we will obey the Lord our God. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	7	Ten days later the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	8	So he called together Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him and all the people from the least to the greatest .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	9	He said to them , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , to whom you sent me to present your petition , says :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	10	“ If you stay in this land , I will build you up and not tear you down ; I will plant you and not uproot you , for I have relented concerning the disaster I have inflicted on you .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	11	Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon , whom you now fear . Do not be afraid of him , declares the Lord , for I am with you and will save you and deliver you from his hands .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	12	I will show you compassion so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your land. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	13	‘ However , if you say , “ We will not stay in this land , ” and so disobey the Lord your God ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	14	and if you say , “ No , we will go and live in Egypt , where we will not see war or hear the trumpet or be hungry for bread , ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	15	then hear the word of the Lord , you remnant of Judah . This is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : “ If you are determined to go to Egypt and you do go to settle there ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	16	then the sword you fear will overtake you there , and the famine you dread will follow you into Egypt , and there you will die .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	17	Indeed , all who are determined to go to Egypt to settle there will die by the sword , famine and plague ; not one of them will survive or escape the disaster I will bring on them. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	18	This is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : “ As my anger and wrath have been poured out on those who lived in Jerusalem , so will my wrath be poured out on you when you go to Egypt . You will be a curse [ b ] and an object of horror , a curse [ c ] and an object of reproach ; you will never see this place again. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	19	‘ Remnant of Judah , the Lord has told you , “ Do not go to Egypt. ” Be sure of this : I warn you today
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	20	that you made a fatal mistake when you sent me to the Lord your God and said , “ Pray to the Lord our God for us ; tell us everything he says and we will do it. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	21	I have told you today , but you still have not obeyed the Lord your God in all he sent me to tell you .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	42	22	So now , be sure of this : you will die by the sword , famine and plague in the place where you want to go to settle. ’ Footnotes - Jeremiah 42:1 Hebrew ; Septuagint ( see also 43:2 ) Azariah - Jeremiah 42:18 That is , your name will be used in cursing ( see 29:22 ) ; or , others will see that you are cursed . - Jeremiah 42:18 That is , your name will be used in cursing ( see 29:22 ) ; or , others will see that you are cursed .

NIVUK	Jeremiah	43	43	When Jeremiah had finished telling the people all the words of the Lord their God – everything the Lord had sent him to tell them –
NIVUK	Jeremiah	43	2	Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah , ‘ You are lying ! The Lord our God has not sent you to say , “ You must not go to Egypt to settle there. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	43	3	But Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Babylonians , [ a ] so that they may kill us or carry us into exile to Babylon. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	43	4	So Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers and all the people disobeyed the Lord ’ s command to stay in the land of Judah .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	43	5	Instead , Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers led away all the remnant of Judah who had come back to live in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been scattered .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	43	6	They also led away all those whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan – the men , the women , the children and the king ’ s daughters . And they took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah along with them .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	43	7	So they entered Egypt in disobedience to the Lord and went as far as Tahpanhes .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	43	8	In Tahpanhes the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	43	9	‘ While the Jews are watching , take some large stones with you and bury them in clay in the brick pavement at the entrance to Pharaoh ’ s palace in Tahpanhes .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	43	10	Then say to them , “ This is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and I will set his throne over these stones I have buried here ; he will spread his royal canopy above them .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	43	11	He will come and attack Egypt , bringing death to those destined for death , captivity to those destined for captivity , and the sword to those destined for the sword .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	43	12	He will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt ; he will burn their temples and take their gods captive . As a shepherd picks his garment clean of lice , so he will pick Egypt clean and depart .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	43	13	There in the temple of the sun [ b ] in Egypt he will demolish the sacred pillars and will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt. ” ’ Footnotes - Jeremiah 43:3 Or Chaldeans - Jeremiah 43:13 Or in Heliopolis Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	44	This word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Lower Egypt – in Migdol , Tahpanhes and Memphis – and in Upper Egypt :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	2	‘ This is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : you saw the great disaster I brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah . Today they lie deserted and in ruins
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	3	because of the evil they have done . They aroused my anger by burning incense to and worshipping other gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors ever knew .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	4	Again and again I sent my servants the prophets , who said , “ Do not do this detestable thing that I hate ! ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	5	But they did not listen or pay attention ; they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense to other gods .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	6	Therefore , my fierce anger was poured out ; it raged against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem and made them the desolate ruins they are today .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	7	‘ Now this is what the Lord God Almighty , the God of Israel , says : why bring such great disaster on yourselves by cutting off from Judah the men and women , the children and infants , and so leave yourselves without a remnant ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	8	Why arouse my anger with what your hands have made , burning incense to other gods in Egypt , where you have come to live ? You will destroy yourselves and make yourselves a curse [ a ] and an object of reproach among all the nations on earth .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	9	Have you forgotten the wickedness committed by your ancestors and by the kings and queens of Judah and the wickedness committed by you and your wives in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	10	To this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence , nor have they followed my law and the decrees I set before you and your ancestors .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	11	‘ Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : I am determined to bring disaster on you and to destroy all Judah .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	12	; similarly in verse
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	13	I will punish those who live in Egypt with the sword , famine and plague , as I punished Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	14	None of the remnant of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah , to which they long to return and live ; none will return except a few fugitives. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	15	Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods , along with all the women who were present – a large assembly – and all the people living in Lower and Upper Egypt , said to Jeremiah ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	16	‘ We will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord !
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	17	We will certainly do everything we said we would : we will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and our ancestors , our kings and our officials did in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem . At that time we had plenty of food and were well off and suffered no harm .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	18	But ever since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her , we have had nothing and have been perishing by sword and famine. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	19	The women added , ‘ When we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings to her , did not our husbands know that we were making cakes impressed with her image and pouring out drink offerings to her ? ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	20	Then Jeremiah said to all the people , both men and women , who were answering him ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	21	‘ Did not the Lord remember and call to mind the incense burned in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem by you and your ancestors , your kings and your officials and the people of the land ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	22	. Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	23	Because you have burned incense and have sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed him or followed his law or his decrees or his stipulations , this disaster has come upon you , as you now see. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	24	Then Jeremiah said to all the people , including the women , ‘ Hear the word of the Lord , all you people of Judah in Egypt .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	25	This is what the Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : you and your wives have done what you said you would do when you promised , “ We will certainly carry out the vows we made to burn incense and pour out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven. ” ‘ Go ahead then , do what you promised ! Keep your vows !
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	26	But hear the word of the Lord , all you Jews living in Egypt : “ I swear by my great name , ” says the Lord , “ that no one from Judah living anywhere in Egypt shall ever again invoke my name or swear , ‘ As surely as the Sovereign Lord lives. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	27	For I am watching over them for harm , not for good ; the Jews in Egypt will perish by sword and famine until they are all destroyed .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	28	Those who escape the sword and return to the land of Judah from Egypt will be very few . Then the whole remnant of Judah who came to live in Egypt will know whose word will stand – mine or theirs .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	29	‘ “ This will be the sign to you that I will punish you in this place , ” declares the Lord , “ so that you will know that my threats of harm against you will surely stand. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	44	30	This is what the Lord says : “ I am going to deliver Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hands of his enemies who want to kill him , just as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , the enemy who wanted to kill him. ” ’ Footnotes - Jeremiah 44:8 That is , your name will be used in cursing ( see 29:22 ) ; or , others will see that you are cursed ; also in verse

NIVUK	Jeremiah	45	45	When Baruch son of Neriah wrote on a scroll the words Jeremiah the prophet dictated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah , Jeremiah said this to Baruch :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	45	2	‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says to you , Baruch :

NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	46	This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	2	Concerning Egypt : This is the message against the army of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt , which was defeated at Carchemish on the River Euphrates by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	3	‘ Prepare your shields , both large and small , and march out for battle !
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	4	Harness the horses , mount the steeds ! Take your positions with helmets on ! Polish your spears , put on your armour !
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	5	What do I see ? They are terrified , they are retreating , their warriors are defeated . They flee in haste without looking back , and there is terror on every side , ’ declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	6	‘ The swift can not flee nor the strong escape . In the north by the River Euphrates they stumble and fall .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	7	‘ Who is this that rises like the Nile , like rivers of surging waters ?
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	8	Egypt rises like the Nile , like rivers of surging waters . She says , “ I will rise and cover the earth ; I will destroy cities and their people. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	9	Charge , you horses ! Drive furiously , you charioteers ! March on , you warriors – men of Cush [ a ] and Put who carry shields , men of Lydia who draw the bow .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	10	But that day belongs to the Lord , the Lord Almighty – a day of vengeance , for vengeance on his foes . The sword will devour till it is satisfied , till it has quenched its thirst with blood . For the Lord , the Lord Almighty , will offer sacrifice in the land of the north by the River Euphrates .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	11	‘ Go up to Gilead and get balm , Virgin Daughter Egypt . But you try many medicines in vain ; there is no healing for you .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	12	The nations will hear of your shame ; your cries will fill the earth . One warrior will stumble over another ; both will fall down together. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	13	This is the message the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to attack Egypt :
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	14	‘ Announce this in Egypt , and proclaim it in Migdol ; proclaim it also in Memphis and Tahpanhes : “ Take your positions and get ready , for the sword devours those around you. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	15	Why will your warriors be laid low ? They can not stand , for the Lord will push them down .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	16	They will stumble repeatedly ; they will fall over each other . They will say , “ Get up , let us go back to our own people and our native lands , away from the sword of the oppressor. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	17	There they will exclaim , “ Pharaoh king of Egypt is only a loud noise ; he has missed his opportunity. ”
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	18	‘ As surely as I live , ’ declares the King , whose name is the Lord Almighty , ‘ one will come who is like Tabor among the mountains , like Carmel by the sea .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	19	Pack your belongings for exile , you who live in Egypt , for Memphis will be laid waste and lie in ruins without inhabitant .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	20	‘ Egypt is a beautiful heifer , but a gadfly is coming against her from the north .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	21	The mercenaries in her ranks are like fattened calves . They too will turn and flee together , they will not stand their ground , for the day of disaster is coming upon them , the time for them to be punished .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	22	Egypt will hiss like a fleeing serpent as the enemy advances in force ; they will come against her with axes , like men who cut down trees .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	23	They will chop down her forest , ’ declares the Lord , ‘ dense though it be . They are more numerous than locusts , they can not be counted .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	24	Daughter Egypt will be put to shame , given into the hands of the people of the north. ’
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	25	The Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I am about to bring punishment on Amon god of Thebes , on Pharaoh , on Egypt and her gods and her kings , and on those who rely on Pharaoh .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	26	I will give them into the hands of those who want to kill them – Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers . Later , however , Egypt will be inhabited as in times past , ’ declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	27	‘ Do not be afraid , Jacob my servant ; do not be dismayed , Israel . I will surely save you out of a distant place , your descendants from the land of their exile . Jacob will again have peace and security , and no one will make him afraid .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	46	28	Do not be afraid , Jacob my servant , for I am with you , ’ declares the Lord . ‘ Though I completely destroy all the nations among which I scatter you , I will not completely destroy you . I will discipline you but only in due measure ; I will not let you go entirely unpunished. ’ Footnotes - Jeremiah 46:9 That is , the upper Nile region Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	52	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king , and he reigned in Jerusalem for eleven years . His mother ’ s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah ; she was from Libnah .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	2	He did evil in the eyes of the Lord , just as Jehoiakim had done .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	3	It was because of the Lord ’ s anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah , and in the end he thrust them from his presence . Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	4	So in the ninth year of Zedekiah ’ s reign , on the tenth day of the tenth month , Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army . They encamped outside the city and built siege works all around it .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	5	The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	6	By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	7	Then the city wall was broken through , and the whole army fled . They left the city at night through the gate between the two walls near the king ’ s garden , though the Babylonians [ a ] were surrounding the city . They fled towards the Arabah , [ b ]
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	8	but the Babylonian [ c ] army pursued King Zedekiah and overtook him in the plains of Jericho . All his soldiers were separated from him and scattered ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	9	and he was captured . He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath , where he pronounced sentence on him .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	10	There at Riblah the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes ; he also killed all the officials of Judah .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	11	Then he put out Zedekiah ’ s eyes , bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon , where he put him in prison till the day of his death .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	12	On the tenth day of the fifth month , in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard , who served the king of Babylon , came to Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	13	He set fire to the temple of the Lord , the royal palace and all the houses of Jerusalem . Every important building he burned down .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	14	- Jeremiah 52:15 Or the populace - Jeremiah 52:21 That is , about 8.1 metres high and 5.4 metres in circumference - Jeremiah 52:22 That is , about 2.3 metres Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	16	But Nebuzaradan left behind the rest of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	17	- Jeremiah 52:7 Or the Jordan Valley - Jeremiah 52:8 Or Chaldean ; also in verse

NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	19	The commander of the imperial guard took away the basins , censers , sprinkling bowls , pots , lampstands , dishes and bowls used for drink offerings – all that were made of pure gold or silver .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	20	The bronze from the two pillars , the Sea and the twelve bronze bulls under it , and the movable stands , which King Solomon had made for the temple of the Lord , was more than could be weighed .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	21	Each pillar was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference [ e ] ; each was four fingers thick , and hollow .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	22	The bronze capital on the top of one pillar was five cubits [ f ] high and was decorated with a network and pomegranates of bronze all around . The other pillar , with its pomegranates , was similar .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	23	There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides ; the total number of pomegranates above the surrounding network was a hundred .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	24	The commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest , Zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	25	Of those still in the city , he took the officer in charge of the fighting men , and seven royal advisers . He also took the secretary who was chief officer in charge of conscripting the people of the land , sixty of whom were found in the city .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	26	Nebuzaradan the commander took them all and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	27	There at Riblah , in the land of Hamath , the king had them executed . So Judah went into captivity , away from her land .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	28	This is the number of the people Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile : in the seventh year , 3,023 Jews ;
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	29	in Nebuchadnezzar ’ s eighteenth year ,
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	832	people from Jerusalem ;
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	30	in his twenty-third year ,

NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	32	He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honour higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	33	So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes and for the rest of his life ate regularly at the king ’ s table .
NIVUK	Jeremiah	52	34	Day by day the king of Babylon gave Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long as he lived , till the day of his death . Footnotes - Jeremiah 52:7 Or Chaldeans ; also in verse

NIVUK	Lamentations	1	1	[ a ] How deserted lies the city , once so full of people ! How like a widow is she , who once was great among the nations ! She who was queen among the provinces has now become a slave .
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	2	Bitterly she weeps at night , tears are on her cheeks . Among all her lovers there is no one to comfort her . All her friends have betrayed her ; they have become her enemies .
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	3	After affliction and harsh labour , Judah has gone into exile . She dwells among the nations ; she finds no resting place . All who pursue her have overtaken her in the midst of her distress .
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	4	The roads to Zion mourn , for no one comes to her appointed festivals . All her gateways are desolate , her priests groan , her young women grieve , and she is in bitter anguish .
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	5	Her foes have become her masters ; her enemies are at ease . The Lord has brought her grief because of her many sins . Her children have gone into exile , captive before the foe .
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	6	All the splendour has departed from Daughter Zion . Her princes are like deer that find no pasture ; in weakness they have fled before the pursuer .
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	7	In the days of her affliction and wandering Jerusalem remembers all the treasures that were hers in days of old . When her people fell into enemy hands , there was no one to help her . Her enemies looked at her and laughed at her destruction .
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	8	Jerusalem has sinned greatly and so has become unclean . All who honoured her despise her , for they have all seen her naked ; she herself groans and turns away .
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	9	Her filthiness clung to her skirts ; she did not consider her future . Her fall was astounding ; there was none to comfort her . ‘ Look , Lord , on my affliction , for the enemy has triumphed. ’
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	10	The enemy laid hands on all her treasures ; she saw pagan nations enter her sanctuary – those you had forbidden to enter your assembly .
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	11	All her people groan as they search for bread ; they barter their treasures for food to keep themselves alive . ‘ Look , Lord , and consider , for I am despised. ’
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	12	‘ Is it nothing to you , all you who pass by ? Look around and see . Is any suffering like my suffering that was inflicted on me , that the Lord brought on me in the day of his fierce anger ?
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	13	‘ From on high he sent fire , sent it down into my bones . He spread a net for my feet and turned me back . He made me desolate , faint all the day long .
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	14	‘ My sins have been bound into a yoke [ b ] ; by his hands they were woven together . They have been hung on my neck , and the Lord has sapped my strength . He has given me into the hands of those I can not withstand .
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	15	‘ The Lord has rejected all the warriors in my midst ; he has summoned an army against me to [ c ] crush my young men . In his winepress the Lord has trampled Virgin Daughter Judah .
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	16	‘ This is why I weep and my eyes overflow with tears . No one is near to comfort me , no one to restore my spirit . My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed. ’
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	17	Zion stretches out her hands , but there is no one to comfort her . The Lord has decreed for Jacob that his neighbours become his foes ; Jerusalem has become an unclean thing among them .
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	18	‘ The Lord is righteous , yet I rebelled against his command . Listen , all you peoples ; look on my suffering . My young men and young women have gone into exile .
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	19	‘ I called to my allies but they betrayed me . My priests and my elders perished in the city while they searched for food to keep themselves alive .
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	20	‘ See , Lord , how distressed I am ! I am in torment within , and in my heart I am disturbed , for I have been most rebellious . Outside , the sword bereaves ; inside , there is only death .
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	21	‘ People have heard my groaning , but there is no one to comfort me . All my enemies have heard of my distress ; they rejoice at what you have done . May you bring the day you have announced so that they may become like me .
NIVUK	Lamentations	1	22	‘ Let all their wickedness come before you ; deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my sins . My groans are many and my heart is faint. ’ Footnotes - Lamentations 1:1 This chapter is an acrostic poem , the verses of which begin with the successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet . - Lamentations 1:14 Most Hebrew manuscripts ; many Hebrew manuscripts and Septuagint He kept watch over my sins - Lamentations 1:15 Or has set a time for me / when he will Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Lamentations	2	2	Without pity the Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob ; in his wrath he has torn down the strongholds of Daughter Judah . He has brought her kingdom and its princes down to the ground in dishonour .
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	3	In fierce anger he has cut off every horn [ c ] [ d ] of Israel . He has withdrawn his right hand at the approach of the enemy . He has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire that consumes everything around it .
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	4	Like an enemy he has strung his bow ; his right hand is ready . Like a foe he has slain all who were pleasing to the eye ; he has poured out his wrath like fire on the tent of Daughter Zion .
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	5	The Lord is like an enemy ; he has swallowed up Israel . He has swallowed up all her palaces and destroyed her strongholds . He has multiplied mourning and lamentation for Daughter Judah .
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	6	He has laid waste his dwelling like a garden ; he has destroyed his place of meeting . The Lord has made Zion forget her appointed festivals and her Sabbaths ; in his fierce anger he has spurned both king and priest .
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	7	The Lord has rejected his altar and abandoned his sanctuary . He has given the walls of her palaces into the hands of the enemy ; they have raised a shout in the house of the Lord as on the day of an appointed festival .
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	8	The Lord determined to tear down the wall around Daughter Zion . He stretched out a measuring line and did not withhold his hand from destroying . He made ramparts and walls lament ; together they wasted away .
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	9	Her gates have sunk into the ground ; their bars he has broken and destroyed . Her king and her princes are exiled among the nations , the law is no more , and her prophets no longer find visions from the Lord .
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	10	The elders of Daughter Zion sit on the ground in silence ; they have sprinkled dust on their heads and put on sackcloth . The young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground .
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	11	My eyes fail from weeping , I am in torment within ; my heart is poured out on the ground because my people are destroyed , because children and infants faint in the streets of the city .
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	12	They say to their mothers , ‘ Where is bread and wine ? ’ as they faint like the wounded in the streets of the city , as their lives ebb away in their mothers ’ arms .
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	13	What can I say for you ? With what can I compare you , Daughter Jerusalem ? To what can I liken you , that I may comfort you , Virgin Daughter Zion ? Your wound is as deep as the sea . Who can heal you ?
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	14	The visions of your prophets were false and worthless ; they did not expose your sin to ward off your captivity . The prophecies they gave you were false and misleading .
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	15	All who pass your way clap their hands at you ; they scoff and shake their heads at Daughter Jerusalem : ‘ Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty , the joy of the whole earth ? ’
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	16	All your enemies open their mouths wide against you ; they scoff and gnash their teeth and say , ‘ We have swallowed her up . This is the day we have waited for ; we have lived to see it. ’
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	17	The Lord has done what he planned ; he has fulfilled his word , which he decreed long ago . He has overthrown you without pity , he has let the enemy gloat over you , he has exalted the horn [ e ] of your foes .
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	18	The hearts of the people cry out to the Lord . You walls of Daughter Zion , let your tears flow like a river day and night ; give yourself no relief , your eyes no rest .
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	19	Arise , cry out in the night , as the watches of the night begin ; pour out your heart like water in the presence of the Lord . Lift up your hands to him for the lives of your children , who faint from hunger at every street corner .
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	20	‘ Look , Lord , and consider : whom have you ever treated like this ? Should women eat their offspring , the children they have cared for ? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord ?
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	21	‘ Young and old lie together in the dust of the streets ; my young men and young women have fallen by the sword . You have slain them in the day of your anger ; you have slaughtered them without pity .
NIVUK	Lamentations	2	22	‘ As you summon to a feast day , so you summoned against me terrors on every side . In the day of the Lord ’ s anger no one escaped or survived ; those I cared for and reared my enemy has destroyed. ’ Footnotes - Lamentations 2:1 This chapter is an acrostic poem , the verses of which begin with the successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet . - Lamentations 2:1 Or How the Lord in his anger / has treated Daughter Zion with contempt ! - Lamentations 2:3 Or off / all the strength ; or every king - Lamentations 2:3 Horn here symbolises strength . - Lamentations 2:17 Horn here symbolises strength .

NIVUK	Lamentations	3	3	indeed , he has turned his hand against me again and again , all day long .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	2	He has driven me away and made me walk in darkness rather than light ;
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	4	He has made my skin and my flesh grow old and has broken my bones .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	5	He has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	6	He has made me dwell in darkness like those long dead .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	7	He has walled me in so that I can not escape ; he has weighed me down with chains .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	8	Even when I call out or cry for help , he shuts out my prayer .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	9	He has barred my way with blocks of stone ; he has made my paths crooked .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	10	Like a bear lying in wait , like a lion in hiding ,
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	11	he dragged me from the path and mangled me and left me without help .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	12	He drew his bow and made me the target for his arrows .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	13	He pierced my heart with arrows from his quiver .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	14	I became the laughing-stock of all my people ; they mock me in song all day long .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	15	He has filled me with bitter herbs and given me gall to drink .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	16	He has broken my teeth with gravel ; he has trampled me in the dust .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	17	I have been deprived of peace ; I have forgotten what prosperity is .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	18	So I say , ‘ My splendour is gone and all that I had hoped from the Lord. ’
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	19	I remember my affliction and my wandering , the bitterness and the gall .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	20	I well remember them , and my soul is downcast within me .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	21	Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope :
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	22	Because of the Lord ’ s great love we are not consumed , for his compassions never fail .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	23	They are new every morning ; great is your faithfulness .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	24	I say to myself , ‘ The Lord is my portion ; therefore I will wait for him. ’
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	25	The Lord is good to those whose hope is in him , to the one who seeks him ;
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	26	it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	27	It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	28	Let him sit alone in silence , for the Lord has laid it on him .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	29	Let him bury his face in the dust – there may yet be hope .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	30	Let him offer his cheek to one who would strike him , and let him be filled with disgrace .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	31	For no one is cast off by the Lord for ever .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	32	Though he brings grief , he will show compassion , so great is his unfailing love .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	33	For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to anyone .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	34	To crush underfoot all prisoners in the land ,
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	35	to deny people their rights before the Most High ,
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	36	to deprive them of justice – would not the Lord see such things ?
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	37	Who can speak and have it happen if the Lord has not decreed it ?
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	38	Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that both calamities and good things come ?
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	39	Why should the living complain when punished for their sins ?
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	40	Let us examine our ways and test them , and let us return to the Lord .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	41	Let us lift up our hearts and our hands to God in heaven , and say :
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	42	‘ We have sinned and rebelled and you have not forgiven .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	43	‘ You have covered yourself with anger and pursued us ; you have slain without pity .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	44	You have covered yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can get through .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	45	You have made us scum and refuse among the nations .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	46	‘ All our enemies have opened their mouths wide against us .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	47	We have suffered terror and pitfalls , ruin and destruction. ’
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	48	Streams of tears flow from my eyes because my people are destroyed .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	49	My eyes will flow unceasingly , without relief ,
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	50	until the Lord looks down from heaven and sees .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	51	What I see brings grief to my soul because of all the women of my city .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	52	Those who were my enemies without cause hunted me like a bird .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	53	They tried to end my life in a pit and threw stones at me ;
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	54	the waters closed over my head , and I thought I was about to perish .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	55	I called on your name , Lord , from the depths of the pit .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	56	You heard my plea : ‘ Do not close your ears to my cry for relief. ’
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	57	You came near when I called you , and you said , ‘ Do not fear. ’
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	58	You , Lord , took up my case ; you redeemed my life .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	59	Lord , you have seen the wrong done to me . Uphold my cause !
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	60	You have seen the depth of their vengeance , all their plots against me .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	61	Lord , you have heard their insults , all their plots against me –
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	62	what my enemies whisper and mutter against me all day long .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	63	Look at them ! Sitting or standing , they mock me in their songs .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	64	Pay them back what they deserve , Lord , for what their hands have done .
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	65	Put a veil over their hearts , and may your curse be on them !
NIVUK	Lamentations	3	66	Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens of the Lord .

NIVUK	Lamentations	4	4	Because of thirst the infant ’ s tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth ; the children beg for bread , but no one gives it to them .
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	2	How the precious children of Zion , once worth their weight in gold , are now considered as pots of clay , the work of a potter ’ s hands !
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	3	Even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young , but my people have become heartless like ostriches in the desert .
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	5	Those who once ate delicacies are destitute in the streets . Those brought up in royal purple now lie on ash heaps .
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	6	The punishment of my people is greater than that of Sodom , which was overthrown in a moment without a hand turned to help her .
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	7	Their princes were brighter than snow and whiter than milk , their bodies more ruddy than rubies , their appearance like lapis lazuli .
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	8	But now they are blacker than soot ; they are not recognised in the streets . Their skin has shrivelled on their bones ; it has become as dry as a stick .
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	9	Those killed by the sword are better off than those who die of famine ; racked with hunger , they waste away for lack of food from the field .
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	10	With their own hands compassionate women have cooked their own children , who became their food when my people were destroyed .
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	11	The Lord has given full vent to his wrath ; he has poured out his fierce anger . He kindled a fire in Zion that consumed her foundations .
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	12	The kings of the earth did not believe , nor did any of the peoples of the world , that enemies and foes could enter the gates of Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	13	But it happened because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests , who shed within her the blood of the righteous .
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	14	Now they grope through the streets as if they were blind . They are so defiled with blood that no one dares to touch their garments .
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	15	‘ Go away ! You are unclean ! ’ people cry to them . ‘ Away ! Away ! Don ’ t touch us ! ’ When they flee and wander about , people among the nations say , ‘ They can stay here no longer. ’
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	16	The Lord himself has scattered them ; he no longer watches over them . The priests are shown no honour , the elders no favour .
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	17	Moreover , our eyes failed , looking in vain for help ; from our towers we watched for a nation that could not save us .
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	18	People stalked us at every step , so we could not walk in our streets . Our end was near , our days were numbered , for our end had come .
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	19	Our pursuers were swifter than eagles in the sky ; they chased us over the mountains and lay in wait for us in the desert .
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	20	The Lord ’ s anointed , our very life breath , was caught in their traps . We thought that under his shadow we would live among the nations .
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	21	Rejoice and be glad , Daughter Edom , you who live in the land of Uz . But to you also the cup will be passed ; you will be drunk and stripped naked .
NIVUK	Lamentations	4	22	Your punishment will end , Daughter Zion ; he will not prolong your exile . But he will punish your sin , Daughter Edom , and expose your wickedness .

NIVUK	Lamentations	5	14	The elders are gone from the city gate ; the young men have stopped their music .
NIVUK	Lamentations	5	15	Joy is gone from our hearts ; our dancing has turned to mourning .
NIVUK	Lamentations	5	16	The crown has fallen from our head . Woe to us , for we have sinned !
NIVUK	Lamentations	5	17	Because of this our hearts are faint ; because of these things our eyes grow dim
NIVUK	Lamentations	5	18	for Mount Zion , which lies desolate , with jackals prowling over it .
NIVUK	Lamentations	5	19	You , Lord , reign for ever ; your throne endures from generation to generation .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	2	On the fifth of the month – it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin –
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	3	the word of the Lord came to Ezekiel the priest , the son of Buzi , by the River Kebar in the land of the Babylonians . [ a ] There the hand of the Lord was on him .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	4	I looked , and I saw a violent storm coming out of the north – an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light . The centre of the fire looked like glowing metal ,
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	5	and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures . In appearance their form was human ,
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	6	but each of them had four faces and four wings .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	7	Their legs were straight ; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	8	Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands . All four of them had faces and wings ,
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	9	and the wings of one touched the wings of another . Each one went straight ahead ; they did not turn as they moved .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	10	Their faces looked like this : each of the four had the face of a human being , and on the right side each had the face of a lion , and on the left the face of an ox ; each also had the face of an eagle .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	11	Such were their faces . They each had two wings spreading out upwards , each wing touching that of the creature on either side ; and each had two other wings covering its body .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	12	Each one went straight ahead . Wherever the spirit would go , they would go , without turning as they went .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	13	The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches . Fire moved back and forth among the creatures ; it was bright , and lightning flashed out of it .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	14	The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	15	As I looked at the living creatures , I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	16	This was the appearance and structure of the wheels : they sparkled like topaz , and all four looked alike . Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	17	As they moved , they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced ; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	18	Their rims were high and awesome , and all four rims were full of eyes all around .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	19	When the living creatures moved , the wheels beside them moved ; and when the living creatures rose from the ground , the wheels also rose .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	20	Wherever the spirit would go , they would go , and the wheels would rise along with them , because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	21	When the creatures moved , they also moved ; when the creatures stood still , they also stood still ; and when the creatures rose from the ground , the wheels rose along with them , because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	22	Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something like a vault , sparkling like crystal , and awesome .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	23	Under the vault their wings were stretched out one towards the other , and each had two wings covering its body .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	24	When the creatures moved , I heard the sound of their wings , like the roar of rushing waters , like the voice of the Almighty , [ b ] like the tumult of an army . When they stood still , they lowered their wings .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	25	Then there came a voice from above the vault over their heads as they stood with lowered wings .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	26	Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis lazuli , and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	27	I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal , as if full of fire , and that from there down he looked like fire ; and brilliant light surrounded him .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	1	28	Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day , so was the radiance around him . This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord . When I saw it , I fell face down , and I heard the voice of one speaking .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	2	2	As he spoke , the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet , and I heard him speaking to me .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	2	3	He said : ‘ Son of man , I am sending you to the Israelites , to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me ; they and their ancestors have been in revolt against me to this very day .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	2	4	The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn . Say to them , “ This is what the Sovereign Lord says. ”
NIVUK	Ezekiel	2	5	And whether they listen or fail to listen – for they are a rebellious people – they will know that a prophet has been among them .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	2	6	And you , son of man , do not be afraid of them or their words . Do not be afraid , though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions . Do not be afraid of what they say or be terrified by them , though they are a rebellious people .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	2	7	You must speak my words to them , whether they listen or fail to listen , for they are rebellious .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	2	8	But you , son of man , listen to what I say to you . Do not rebel like that rebellious people ; open your mouth and eat what I give you. ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	2	9	Then I looked , and I saw a hand stretched out to me . In it was a scroll ,
NIVUK	Ezekiel	2	10	which he unrolled before me . On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe . Footnotes - Ezekiel 2:1 The Hebrew phrase ben adam means human being . The phrase son of man is retained as a form of address here and throughout Ezekiel because of its possible association with ‘ Son of Man ’ in the New Testament .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	3	Then he said to me , ‘ Son of man , eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it. ’ So I ate it , and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	2	So I opened my mouth , and he gave me the scroll to eat .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	4	He then said to me : ‘ Son of man , go now to the people of Israel and speak my words to them .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	5	You are not being sent to a people of obscure speech and strange language , but to the people of Israel –
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	6	not to many peoples of obscure speech and strange language , whose words you can not understand . Surely if I had sent you to them , they would have listened to you .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	7	But the people of Israel are not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me , for all the Israelites are hardened and obstinate .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	8	But I will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	9	I will make your forehead like the hardest stone , harder than flint . Do not be afraid of them or terrified by them , though they are a rebellious people. ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	10	And he said to me , ‘ Son of man , listen carefully and take to heart all the words I speak to you .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	11	Go now to your people in exile and speak to them . Say to them , “ This is what the Sovereign Lord says , ” whether they listen or fail to listen. ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	12	Then the Spirit lifted me up , and I heard behind me a loud rumbling sound as the glory of the Lord rose from the place where it was standing . [ a ]
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	13	It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them , a loud rumbling sound .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	14	The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away , and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit , with the strong hand of the Lord on me .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	15	I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Aviv near the River Kebar . And there , where they were living , I sat among them for seven days – deeply distressed . Ezekiel ’ s task as watchman
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	16	At the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me :
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	17	‘ Son of man , I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel ; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	18	When I say to a wicked person , “ You will surely die , ” and you do not warn them or speak out to dissuade them from their evil ways in order to save their life , that wicked person will die for [ b ] their sin , and I will hold you accountable for their blood .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	21	But if you do warn the righteous person not to sin and they do not sin , they will surely live because they took warning , and you will have saved yourself. ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	22	The hand of the Lord was on me there , and he said to me , ‘ Get up and go out to the plain , and there I will speak to you. ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	23	So I got up and went out to the plain . And the glory of the Lord was standing there , like the glory I had seen by the River Kebar , and I fell face down .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	24	Then the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet . He spoke to me and said : ‘ Go , shut yourself inside your house .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	25	And you , son of man , they will tie with ropes ; you will be bound so that you can not go out among the people .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	26	I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them , for they are a rebellious people .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	3	27	But when I speak to you , I will open your mouth and you shall say to them , “ This is what the Sovereign Lord says. ” Whoever will listen let them listen , and whoever will refuse let them refuse ; for they are a rebellious people .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	4	4	‘ Then lie on your left side and put the sin of the people of Israel upon yourself . [ a ] You are to bear their sin for the number of days you lie on your side .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	4	2	Then lay siege to it : erect siege works against it , build a ramp up to it , set up camps against it and put battering-rams around it .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	4	3	Then take an iron pan , place it as an iron wall between you and the city and turn your face towards it . It will be under siege , and you shall besiege it . This will be a sign to the people of Israel .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	4	5	I have assigned you the same number of days as the years of their sin . So for
NIVUK	Ezekiel	4	390	days you lie on your side .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	4	6	‘ After you have finished this , lie down again , this time on your right side , and bear the sin of the people of Judah . I have assigned you

NIVUK	Ezekiel	4	8	I will tie you up with ropes so that you can not turn from one side to the other until you have finished the days of your siege .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	4	9	‘ Take wheat and barley , beans and lentils , millet and spelt ; put them in a storage jar and use them to make bread for yourself . You are to eat it during the

NIVUK	Ezekiel	4	11	Also measure out a sixth of a hin [ c ] of water and drink it at set times .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	4	12	Eat the food as you would a loaf of barley bread ; bake it in the sight of the people , using human excrement for fuel. ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	4	13	The Lord said , ‘ In this way the people of Israel will eat defiled food among the nations where I will drive them. ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	4	14	Then I said , ‘ Not so , Sovereign Lord ! I have never defiled myself . From my youth until now I have never eaten anything found dead or torn by wild animals . No impure meat has ever entered my mouth. ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	4	15	‘ Very well , ’ he said , ‘ I will let you bake your bread over cow dung instead of human excrement. ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	4	16	He then said to me : ‘ Son of man , I am about to cut off the food supply in Jerusalem . The people will eat rationed food in anxiety and drink rationed water in despair ,
NIVUK	Ezekiel	4	17	for food and water will be scarce . They will be appalled at the sight of each other and will waste away because of [ d ] their sin . Footnotes - Ezekiel 4:4 Or upon your side - Ezekiel 4:10 That is , about

NIVUK	Ezekiel	5	3	But take a few hairs and tuck them away in the folds of your garment .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	5	4	Again , take a few of these and throw them into the fire and burn them up . A fire will spread from there to all Israel .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	5	6	Yet in her wickedness she has rebelled against my laws and decrees more than the nations and countries around her . She has rejected my laws and has not followed my decrees .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	5	7	‘ Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says : you have been more unruly than the nations around you and have not followed my decrees or kept my laws . You have not even [ a ] conformed to the standards of the nations around you .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	8	8	He said to me , ‘ Son of man , now dig into the wall. ’ So I dug into the wall and saw a doorway there .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	8	2	I looked , and I saw a figure like that of a man . [ a ] From what appeared to be his waist down he was like fire , and from there up his appearance was as bright as glowing metal .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	8	3	He stretched out what looked like a hand and took me by the hair of my head . The Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and in visions of God he took me to Jerusalem , to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court , where the idol that provokes to jealousy stood .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	8	4	And there before me was the glory of the God of Israel , as in the vision I had seen in the plain .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	8	5	Then he said to me , ‘ Son of man , look towards the north. ’ So I looked , and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar I saw this idol of jealousy .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	8	6	And he said to me , ‘ Son of man , do you see what they are doing – the utterly detestable things the Israelites are doing here , things that will drive me far from my sanctuary ? But you will see things that are even more detestable. ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	8	7	Then he brought me to the entrance to the court . I looked , and I saw a hole in the wall .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	8	9	And he said to me , ‘ Go in and see the wicked and detestable things they are doing here. ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	8	10	So I went in and looked , and I saw portrayed all over the walls all kinds of crawling things and unclean animals and all the idols of Israel .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	8	11	In front of them stood seventy elders of Israel , and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan was standing among them . Each had a censer in his hand , and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	8	12	He said to me , ‘ Son of man , have you seen what the elders of Israel are doing in the darkness , each at the shrine of his own idol ? They say , “ The Lord does not see us ; the Lord has forsaken the land. ” ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	8	13	Again , he said , ‘ You will see them doing things that are even more detestable. ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	8	14	Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the Lord , and I saw women sitting there , mourning the god Tammuz .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	8	15	He said to me , ‘ Do you see this , son of man ? You will see things that are even more detestable than this. ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	8	16	He then brought me into the inner court of the house of the Lord , and there at the entrance to the temple , between the portico and the altar , were about twenty-five men . With their backs towards the temple of the Lord and their faces towards the east , they were bowing down to the sun in the east .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	8	17	He said to me , ‘ Have you seen this , son of man ? Is it a trivial matter for the people of Judah to do the detestable things they are doing here ? Must they also fill the land with violence and continually arouse my anger ? Look at them putting the branch to their nose !
NIVUK	Ezekiel	8	18	Therefore I will deal with them in anger ; I will not look on them with pity or spare them . Although they shout in my ears , I will not listen to them. ’ Footnotes - Ezekiel 8:2 Or saw a fiery figure Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Ezekiel	9	2	And I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate , which faces north , each with a deadly weapon in his hand . With them was a man clothed in linen who had a writing kit at his side . They came in and stood beside the bronze altar .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	9	3	Now the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the cherubim , where it had been , and moved to the threshold of the temple . Then the Lord called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side

NIVUK	Ezekiel	9	6	Slaughter the old men , the young men and women , the mothers and children , but do not touch anyone who has the mark . Begin at my sanctuary. ’ So they began with the old men who were in front of the temple .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	9	7	Then he said to them , ‘ Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain . Go ! ’ So they went out and began killing throughout the city .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	9	8	While they were killing and I was left alone , I fell face down , crying out , ‘ Alas , Sovereign Lord ! Are you going to destroy the entire remnant of Israel in this outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem ? ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	9	10	So I will not look on them with pity or spare them , but I will bring down on their own heads what they have done. ’

NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	10	As for their appearance , the four of them looked alike ; each was like a wheel intersecting a wheel .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	2	The Lord said to the man clothed in linen , ‘ Go in among the wheels beneath the cherubim . Fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city. ’ And as I watched , he went in .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	3	Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in , and a cloud filled the inner court .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	4	Then the glory of the Lord rose from above the cherubim and moved to the threshold of the temple . The cloud filled the temple , and the court was full of the radiance of the glory of the Lord .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	5	The sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard as far away as the outer court , like the voice of God Almighty [ a ] when he speaks .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	6	When the Lord commanded the man in linen , ‘ Take fire from among the wheels , from among the cherubim , ’ the man went in and stood beside a wheel .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	7	Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand to the fire that was among them . He took up some of it and put it into the hands of the man in linen , who took it and went out .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	8	( Under the wings of the cherubim could be seen what looked like human hands . )
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	9	I looked , and I saw beside the cherubim four wheels , one beside each of the cherubim ; the wheels sparkled like topaz .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	11	As they moved , they would go in any one of the four directions the cherubim faced ; the wheels did not turn about [ b ] as the cherubim went . The cherubim went in whatever direction the head faced , without turning as they went .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	12	Their entire bodies , including their backs , their hands and their wings , were completely full of eyes , as were their four wheels .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	13	I heard the wheels being called ‘ the whirling wheels ’ .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	14	Each of the cherubim had four faces : one face was that of a cherub , the second the face of a human being , the third the face of a lion , and the fourth the face of an eagle .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	15	Then the cherubim rose upward . These were the living creatures I had seen by the River Kebar .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	16	When the cherubim moved , the wheels beside them moved ; and when the cherubim spread their wings to rise from the ground , the wheels did not leave their side .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	17	When the cherubim stood still , they also stood still ; and when the cherubim rose , they rose with them , because the spirit of the living creatures was in them .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	18	Then the glory of the Lord departed from over the threshold of the temple and stopped above the cherubim .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	19	While I watched , the cherubim spread their wings and rose from the ground , and as they went , the wheels went with them . They stopped at the entrance of the east gate of the Lord ’ s house , and the glory of the God of Israel was above them .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	20	These were the living creatures I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the River Kebar , and I realised that they were cherubim .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	21	Each had four faces and four wings , and under their wings was what looked like human hands .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	10	22	Their faces had the same appearance as those I had seen by the River Kebar . Each one went straight ahead . Footnotes - Ezekiel 10:5 Hebrew El-Shaddai - Ezekiel 10:11 Or aside Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Ezekiel	11	11	This city will not be a pot for you , nor will you be the meat in it ; I will execute judgment on you at the borders of Israel .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	11	2	The Lord said to me , ‘ Son of man , these are the men who are plotting evil and giving wicked advice in this city .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	11	12	And you will know that I am the Lord , for you have not followed my decrees or kept my laws but have conformed to the standards of the nations around you. ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	11	13	Now as I was prophesying , Pelatiah son of Benaiah died . Then I fell face down and cried out in a loud voice , ‘ Alas , Sovereign Lord ! Will you completely destroy the remnant of Israel ? ’ The promise of Israel ’ s return
NIVUK	Ezekiel	11	14	The word of the Lord came to me :
NIVUK	Ezekiel	11	15	‘ Son of man , the people of Jerusalem have said of your fellow exiles and all the other Israelites , “ They are far away from the Lord ; this land was given to us as our possession. ”
NIVUK	Ezekiel	11	16	‘ Therefore say : “ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : although I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries , yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone. ”
NIVUK	Ezekiel	11	17	‘ Therefore say : “ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : I will gather you from the nations and bring you back from the countries where you have been scattered , and I will give you back the land of Israel again. ”
NIVUK	Ezekiel	11	18	‘ They will return to it and remove all its vile images and detestable idols .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	11	19	I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them ; I will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	11	20	Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws . They will be my people , and I will be their God .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	11	21	But as for those whose hearts are devoted to their vile images and detestable idols , I will bring down on their own heads what they have done , declares the Sovereign Lord. ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	11	22	Then the cherubim , with the wheels beside them , spread their wings , and the glory of the God of Israel was above them .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	11	23	The glory of the Lord went up from within the city and stopped above the mountain east of it .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	11	24	The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the exiles in Babylonia [ a ] in the vision given by the Spirit of God . Then the vision I had seen went up from me ,

NIVUK	Ezekiel	12	2	‘ Son of man , you are living among a rebellious people . They have eyes to see but do not see and ears to hear but do not hear , for they are a rebellious people .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	12	3	‘ Therefore , son of man , pack your belongings for exile and in the daytime , as they watch , set out and go from where you are to another place . Perhaps they will understand , though they are a rebellious people .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	12	17	The word of the Lord came to me :
NIVUK	Ezekiel	12	18	‘ Son of man , tremble as you eat your food , and shudder in fear as you drink your water .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	12	19	Say to the people of the land : “ This is what the Sovereign Lord says about those living in Jerusalem and in the land of Israel : they will eat their food in anxiety and drink their water in despair , for their land will be stripped of everything in it because of the violence of all who live there .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	5	No one looked on you with pity or had compassion enough to do any of these things for you . Rather , you were thrown out into the open field , for on the day you were born you were despised .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	36	This is what the Sovereign Lord says : because you poured out your lust and exposed your naked body in your promiscuity with your lovers , and because of all your detestable idols , and because you gave them your children ’ s blood ,
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	37	therefore I am going to gather all your lovers , with whom you found pleasure , those you loved as well as those you hated . I will gather them against you from all around and will strip you in front of them , and they will see you stark naked .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	38	I will sentence you to the punishment of women who commit adultery and who shed blood ; I will bring on you the blood vengeance of my wrath and jealous anger .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	39	Then I will deliver you into the hands of your lovers , and they will tear down your mounds and destroy your lofty shrines . They will strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewellery and leave you stark naked .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	40	They will bring a mob against you , who will stone you and hack you to pieces with their swords .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	41	They will burn down your houses and inflict punishment on you in the sight of many women . I will put a stop to your prostitution , and you will no longer pay your lovers .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	42	Then my wrath against you will subside and my jealous anger will turn away from you ; I will be calm and no longer angry .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	43	‘ “ Because you did not remember the days of your youth but enraged me with all these things , I will surely bring down on your head what you have done , declares the Sovereign Lord . Did you not add lewdness to all your other detestable practices ?
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	44	‘ “ Everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb about you : ‘ Like mother , like daughter. ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	45	You are a true daughter of your mother , who despised her husband and her children ; and you are a true sister of your sisters , who despised their husbands and their children . Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	46	Your elder sister was Samaria , who lived to the north of you with her daughters ; and your younger sister , who lived to the south of you with her daughters , was Sodom .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	47	You not only followed their ways and copied their detestable practices , but in all your ways you soon became more depraved than they .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	48	As surely as I live , declares the Sovereign Lord , your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you and your daughters have done .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	49	‘ “ Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom : she and her daughters were arrogant , overfed and unconcerned ; they did not help the poor and needy .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	50	They were haughty and did detestable things before me . Therefore I did away with them as you have seen .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	51	Samaria did not commit half the sins you did . You have done more detestable things than they , and have made your sisters seem righteous by all these things you have done .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	52	Bear your disgrace , for you have furnished some justification for your sisters . Because your sins were more vile than theirs , they appear more righteous than you . So then , be ashamed and bear your disgrace , for you have made your sisters appear righteous .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	53	‘ “ However , I will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and of Samaria and her daughters , and your fortunes along with them ,
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	54	so that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you have done in giving them comfort .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	55	And your sisters , Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters , will return to what they were before ; and you and your daughters will return to what you were before .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	56	You would not even mention your sister Sodom in the day of your pride ,
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	57	before your wickedness was uncovered . Even so , you are now scorned by the daughters of Edom [ e ] and all her neighbours and the daughters of the Philistines – all those around you who despise you .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	58	You will bear the consequences of your lewdness and your detestable practices , declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	59	‘ “ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : I will deal with you as you deserve , because you have despised my oath by breaking the covenant .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	60	Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth , and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	61	Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters , both those who are older than you and those who are younger . I will give them to you as daughters , but not on the basis of my covenant with you .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	62	So I will establish my covenant with you , and you will know that I am the Lord .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	16	63	Then , when I make atonement for you for all you have done , you will remember and be ashamed and never again open your mouth because of your humiliation , declares the Sovereign Lord. ” ’ Footnotes - Ezekiel 16:6 A few Hebrew manuscripts , Septuagint and Syriac ; most Hebrew manuscripts repeat and as you lay there in your blood I said to you , ‘ Live ! ’ - Ezekiel 16:16 The meaning of the Hebrew for this sentence is uncertain . - Ezekiel 16:29 Or Chaldea - Ezekiel 16:30 Or How feverish is your heart , - Ezekiel 16:57 Many Hebrew manuscripts and Syriac ; most Hebrew manuscripts , Septuagint and Vulgate Aram Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	17	Pharaoh with his mighty army and great horde will be of no help to him in war , when ramps are built and siege works erected to destroy many lives .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	2	‘ Son of man , set forth an allegory and tell it to the Israelites as a parable .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	3	Say to them , “ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : a great eagle with powerful wings , long feathers and full plumage of varied colours came to Lebanon . Taking hold of the top of a cedar ,
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	4	he broke off its topmost shoot and carried it away to a land of merchants , where he planted it in a city of traders .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	5	‘ “ He took one of the seedlings of the land and put it in fertile soil . He planted it like a willow by abundant water ,
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	6	and it sprouted and became a low , spreading vine . Its branches turned towards him , but its roots remained under it . So it became a vine and produced branches and put out leafy boughs .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	7	‘ “ But there was another great eagle with powerful wings and full plumage . The vine now sent out its roots towards him from the plot where it was planted and stretched out its branches to him for water .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	8	It had been planted in good soil by abundant water so that it would produce branches , bear fruit and become a splendid vine. ”
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	9	‘ Say to them , “ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : will it thrive ? Will it not be uprooted and stripped of its fruit so that it withers ? All its new growth will wither . It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it up by the roots .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	10	It has been planted , but will it thrive ? Will it not wither completely when the east wind strikes it – wither away in the plot where it grew ? ” ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	11	Then the word of the Lord came to me :
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	12	‘ Say to this rebellious people , “ Do you not know what these things mean ? ” Say to them : “ The king of Babylon went to Jerusalem and carried off her king and her nobles , bringing them back with him to Babylon .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	13	Then he took a member of the royal family and made a treaty with him , putting him under oath . He also carried away the leading men of the land ,
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	14	so that the kingdom would be brought low , unable to rise again , surviving only by keeping his treaty .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	15	But the king rebelled against him by sending his envoys to Egypt to get horses and a large army . Will he succeed ? Will he who does such things escape ? Will he break the treaty and yet escape ?
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	16	‘ “ As surely as I live , declares the Sovereign Lord , he shall die in Babylon , in the land of the king who put him on the throne , whose oath he despised and whose treaty he broke .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	18	He despised the oath by breaking the covenant . Because he had given his hand in pledge and yet did all these things , he shall not escape .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	19	‘ “ Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says : as surely as I live , I will repay him for despising my oath and breaking my covenant .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	20	I will spread my net for him , and he will be caught in my snare . I will bring him to Babylon and execute judgment on him there because he was unfaithful to me .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	21	All his choice troops will fall by the sword , and the survivors will be scattered to the winds . Then you will know that I the Lord have spoken .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	22	‘ “ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : I myself will take a shoot from the very top of a cedar and plant it ; I will break off a tender sprig from its topmost shoots and plant it on a high and lofty mountain .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	23	On the mountain heights of Israel I will plant it ; it will produce branches and bear fruit and become a splendid cedar . Birds of every kind will nest in it ; they will find shelter in the shade of its branches .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	17	24	All the trees of the forest will know that I the Lord bring down the tall tree and make the low tree grow tall .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	21	13	‘ “ Testing will surely come . And what if even the sceptre , which the sword despises , does not continue ? declares the Sovereign Lord. ”
NIVUK	Ezekiel	21	14	‘ So then , son of man , prophesy and strike your hands together . Let the sword strike twice , even three times . It is a sword for slaughter – a sword for great slaughter , closing in on them from every side .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	21	22	Into his right hand will come the lot for Jerusalem , where he is to set up battering-rams , to give the command to slaughter , to sound the battle cry , to set battering-rams against the gates , to build a ramp and to erect siege works .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	21	23	It will seem like a false omen to those who have sworn allegiance to him , but he will remind them of their guilt and take them captive .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	21	24	‘ Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says : “ Because you people have brought to mind your guilt by your open rebellion , revealing your sins in all that you do – because you have done this , you will be taken captive .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	31	4	The waters nourished it , deep springs made it grow tall ; their streams flowed all around its base and sent their channels to all the trees of the field .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	31	5	So it towered higher than all the trees of the field ; its boughs increased and its branches grew long , spreading because of abundant waters .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	31	6	All the birds of the sky nested in its boughs , all the wild animals gave birth under its branches ; all the great nations lived in its shade .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	31	8	The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it , nor could the junipers equal its boughs , nor could the plane trees compare with its branches – no tree in the garden of God could match its beauty .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	31	12	and the most ruthless of foreign nations cut it down and left it . Its boughs fell on the mountains and in all the valleys ; its branches lay broken in all the ravines of the land . All the nations of the earth came out from under its shade and left it .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	31	14	Therefore no other trees by the waters are ever to tower proudly on high , lifting their tops above the thick foliage . No other trees so well-watered are ever to reach such a height ; they are all destined for death , for the earth below , among mortals who go down to the realm of the dead .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	31	15	‘ “ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : on the day it was brought down to the realm of the dead I covered the deep springs with mourning for it ; I held back its streams , and its abundant waters were restrained . Because of it I clothed Lebanon with gloom , and all the trees of the field withered away .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	2	‘ Son of man , speak to your people and say to them : “ When I bring the sword against a land , and the people of the land choose one of their men and make him their watchman ,
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	3	and he sees the sword coming against the land and blows the trumpet to warn the people ,
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	4	then if anyone hears the trumpet but does not heed the warning and the sword comes and takes their life , their blood will be on their own head .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	5	Since they heard the sound of the trumpet but did not heed the warning , their blood will be on their own head . If they had heeded the warning , they would have saved themselves .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	6	But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people and the sword comes and takes someone ’ s life , that person ’ s life will be taken because of their sin , but I will hold the watchman accountable for their blood. ”
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	7	‘ Son of man , I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel ; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	8	When I say to the wicked , “ You wicked person , you will surely die , ” and you do not speak out to dissuade them from their ways , that wicked person will die for [ a ] their sin , and I will hold you accountable for their blood .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	10	‘ Son of man , say to the Israelites , “ This is what you are saying : ‘ Our offences and sins weigh us down , and we are wasting away because of [ b ] them . How then can we live ? ’ ”
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	11	Say to them , “ As surely as I live , declares the Sovereign Lord , I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked , but rather that they turn from their ways and live . Turn ! Turn from your evil ways ! Why will you die , people of Israel ? ”
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	12	‘ Therefore , son of man , say to your people , “ If someone who is righteous disobeys , that person ’ s former righteousness will count for nothing . And if someone who is wicked repents , that person ’ s former wickedness will not bring condemnation . The righteous person who sins will not be allowed to live even though they were formerly righteous. ”
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	13	If I tell a righteous person that they will surely live , but then they trust in their righteousness and do evil , none of the righteous things that person has done will be remembered ; they will die for the evil they have done .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	14	And if I say to a wicked person , “ You will surely die , ” but they then turn away from their sin and do what is just and right –
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	15	if they give back what they took in pledge for a loan , return what they have stolen , follow the decrees that give life , and do no evil – that person will surely live ; they will not die .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	16	None of the sins that person has committed will be remembered against them . They have done what is just and right ; they will surely live .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	17	‘ Yet your people say , “ The way of the Lord is not just. ” But it is their way that is not just .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	18	If a righteous person turns from their righteousness and does evil , they will die for it .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	19	And if a wicked person turns away from their wickedness and does what is just and right , they will live by doing so .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	20	Yet you Israelites say , “ The way of the Lord is not just. ” But I will judge each of you according to your own ways. ’ Jerusalem ’ s fall explained
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	21	In the twelfth year of our exile , in the tenth month on the fifth day , a man who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said , ‘ The city has fallen ! ’
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	22	Now the evening before the man arrived , the hand of the Lord was on me , and he opened my mouth before the man came to me in the morning . So my mouth was opened and I was no longer silent .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	23	Then the word of the Lord came to me :
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	24	‘ Son of man , the people living in those ruins in the land of Israel are saying , “ Abraham was only one man , yet he possessed the land . But we are many ; surely the land has been given to us as our possession. ”
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	25	Therefore say to them , “ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : since you eat meat with the blood still in it and look to your idols and shed blood , should you then possess the land ?
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	26	You rely on your sword , you do detestable things , and each of you defiles his neighbour ’ s wife . Should you then possess the land ? ”
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	27	‘ Say this to them : “ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : as surely as I live , those who are left in the ruins will fall by the sword , those out in the country I will give to the wild animals to be devoured , and those in strongholds and caves will die of a plague .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	28	I will make the land a desolate waste , and her proud strength will come to an end , and the mountains of Israel will become desolate so that no one will cross them .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	29	Then they will know that I am the Lord , when I have made the land a desolate waste because of all the detestable things they have done. ”
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	30	‘ As for you , son of man , your people are talking together about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses , saying to each other , “ Come and hear the message that has come from the Lord. ”
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	31	My people come to you , as they usually do , and sit before you to hear your words , but they do not put them into practice . Their mouths speak of love , but their hearts are greedy for unjust gain .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	33	32	Indeed , to them you are nothing more than one who sings love songs with a beautiful voice and plays an instrument well , for they hear your words but do not put them into practice .

NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	34	The word of the Lord came to me :
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	2	‘ Son of man , prophesy against the shepherds of Israel ; prophesy and say to them : “ This is what the Sovereign Lord says : woe to you shepherds of Israel who only take care of yourselves ! Should not shepherds take care of the flock ?
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	3	You eat the curds , clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals , but you do not take care of the flock .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	4	You have not strengthened the weak or healed those who are ill or bound up the injured . You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost . You have ruled them harshly and brutally .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	5	So they were scattered because there was no shepherd , and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild animals .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	6	My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill . They were scattered over the whole earth , and no one searched or looked for them .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	7	‘ “ Therefore , you shepherds , hear the word of the Lord :
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	8	as surely as I live , declares the Sovereign Lord , because my flock lacks a shepherd and so has been plundered and has become food for all the wild animals , and because my shepherds did not search for my flock but cared for themselves rather than for my flock ,
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	9	therefore , you shepherds , hear the word of the Lord :
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	10	this is what the Sovereign Lord says : I am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for my flock . I will remove them from tending the flock so that the shepherds can no longer feed themselves . I will rescue my flock from their mouths , and it will no longer be food for them .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	11	‘ “ For this is what the Sovereign Lord says : I myself will search for my sheep and look after them .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	12	As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them , so will I look after my sheep . I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	13	I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries , and I will bring them into their own land . I will pasture them on the mountains of Israel , in the ravines and in all the settlements in the land .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	14	I will tend them in a good pasture , and the mountain heights of Israel will be their grazing land . There they will lie down in good grazing land , and there they will feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	15	I myself will tend my sheep and make them lie down , declares the Sovereign Lord .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	16	I will search for the lost and bring back the strays . I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak , but the sleek and the strong I will destroy . I will shepherd the flock with justice .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	17	‘ “ As for you , my flock , this is what the Sovereign Lord says : I will judge between one sheep and another , and between rams and goats .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	18	Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture ? Must you also trample the rest of your pasture with your feet ? Is it not enough for you to drink clear water ? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet ?
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	19	Must my flock feed on what you have trampled and drink what you have muddied with your feet ?
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	20	‘ “ Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says to them : see , I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	21	Because you shove with flank and shoulder , butting all the weak sheep with your horns until you have driven them away ,
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	22	I will save my flock , and they will no longer be plundered . I will judge between one sheep and another .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	23	I will place over them one shepherd , my servant David , and he will tend them ; he will tend them and be their shepherd .
NIVUK	Ezekiel	34	24	I the Lord will be their God , and my servant David will be prince among them . I the Lord have spoken .

NIVUK	Daniel	1	1	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah , Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it .
NIVUK	Daniel	1	2	And the Lord delivered Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand , along with some of the articles from the temple of God . These he carried off to the temple of his god in Babylonia [ a ] and put in the treasure-house of his god .
NIVUK	Daniel	1	3	Then the king ordered Ashpenaz , chief of his court officials , to bring into the king ’ s service some of the Israelites from the royal family and the nobility –
NIVUK	Daniel	1	4	young men without any physical defect , handsome , showing aptitude for every kind of learning , well informed , quick to understand , and qualified to serve in the king ’ s palace . He was to teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians . [ b ]
NIVUK	Daniel	1	5	The king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from the king ’ s table . They were to be trained for three years , and after that they were to enter the king ’ s service .
NIVUK	Daniel	1	6	Among those who were chosen were some from Judah : Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael and Azariah .
NIVUK	Daniel	1	7	The chief official gave them new names : to Daniel , the name Belteshazzar ; to Hananiah , Shadrach ; to Mishael , Meshach ; and to Azariah , Abednego .
NIVUK	Daniel	1	8	But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine , and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself in this way .
NIVUK	Daniel	1	9	Now God had caused the official to show favour and compassion to Daniel ,
NIVUK	Daniel	1	10	but the official told Daniel , ‘ I am afraid of my lord the king , who has assigned your [ c ] food and drink . Why should he see you looking worse than the other young men of your age ? The king would then have my head because of you. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	1	11	Daniel then said to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael and Azariah ,
NIVUK	Daniel	1	12	‘ Please test your servants for ten days : give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink .
NIVUK	Daniel	1	13	Then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food , and treat your servants in accordance with what you see. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	1	14	So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days .
NIVUK	Daniel	1	15	At the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food .
NIVUK	Daniel	1	16	So the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead .
NIVUK	Daniel	1	17	To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning . And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds .
NIVUK	Daniel	1	18	At the end of the time set by the king to bring them into his service , the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar .

NIVUK	Daniel	2	2	So the king summoned the magicians , enchanters , sorcerers and astrologers [ a ] to tell him what he had dreamed . When they came in and stood before the king ,
NIVUK	Daniel	2	3	he said to them , ‘ I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means. ’ [ b ]

NIVUK	Daniel	2	8	Then the king answered , ‘ I am certain that you are trying to gain time , because you realise that this is what I have firmly decided :
NIVUK	Daniel	2	9	if you do not tell me the dream , there is only one penalty for you . You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things , hoping the situation will change . So then , tell me the dream , and I will know that you can interpret it for me. ’

NIVUK	Daniel	2	11	What the king asks is too difficult . No one can reveal it to the king except the gods , and they do not live among humans. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	2	12	This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	13	So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death , and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	14	When Arioch , the commander of the king ’ s guard , had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon , Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	15	He asked the king ’ s officer , ‘ Why did the king issue such a harsh decree ? ’ Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	16	At this , Daniel went in to the king and asked for time , so that he might interpret the dream for him .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	17	Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah , Mishael and Azariah .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	18	He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery , so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	19	During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision . Then Daniel praised the God of heaven
NIVUK	Daniel	2	20	and said : ‘ Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever ; wisdom and power are his .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	21	He changes times and seasons ; he deposes kings and raises up others . He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	22	He reveals deep and hidden things ; he knows what lies in darkness , and light dwells with him .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	23	I thank and praise you , God of my ancestors : you have given me wisdom and power , you have made known to me what we asked of you , you have made known to us the dream of the king. ’ Daniel interprets the dream
NIVUK	Daniel	2	24	Then Daniel went to Arioch , whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon , and said to him , ‘ Do not execute the wise men of Babylon . Take me to the king , and I will interpret his dream for him. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	2	25	Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said , ‘ I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	2	26	The king asked Daniel ( also called Belteshazzar ) , ‘ Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it ? ’
NIVUK	Daniel	2	27	Daniel replied , ‘ No wise man , enchanter , magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about ,
NIVUK	Daniel	2	28	but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries . He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come . Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you were lying in bed are these :
NIVUK	Daniel	2	29	‘ As Your Majesty was lying there , your mind turned to things to come , and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	30	As for me , this mystery has been revealed to me , not because I have greater wisdom than anyone else alive , but so that Your Majesty may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	31	‘ Your Majesty looked , and there before you stood a large statue – an enormous , dazzling statue , awesome in appearance .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	32	The head of the statue was made of pure gold , its chest and arms of silver , its belly and thighs of bronze ,
NIVUK	Daniel	2	33	its legs of iron , its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	34	While you were watching , a rock was cut out , but not by human hands . It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	35	Then the iron , the clay , the bronze , the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing-floor in the summer . The wind swept them away without leaving a trace . But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	36	‘ This was the dream , and now we will interpret it to the king .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	37	Your Majesty , you are the king of kings . The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory ;
NIVUK	Daniel	2	38	in your hands he has placed all mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds in the sky . Wherever they live , he has made you ruler over them all . You are that head of gold .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	39	‘ After you , another kingdom will arise , inferior to yours . Next , a third kingdom , one of bronze , will rule over the whole earth .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	40	Finally , there will be a fourth kingdom , strong as iron – for iron breaks and smashes everything – and as iron breaks things to pieces , so it will crush and break all the others .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	41	Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron , so this will be a divided kingdom ; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it , even as you saw iron mixed with clay .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	42	As the toes were partly iron and partly clay , so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	43	And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay , so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united , any more than iron mixes with clay .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	44	‘ In the time of those kings , the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed , nor will it be left to another people . It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end , but it will itself endure for ever .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	45	This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain , but not by human hands – a rock that broke the iron , the bronze , the clay , the silver and the gold to pieces . ‘ The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future . The dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	2	46	Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honour and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	47	The king said to Daniel , ‘ Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries , for you were able to reveal this mystery. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	2	48	Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him . He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men .
NIVUK	Daniel	2	49	Moreover , at Daniel ’ s request the king appointed Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego chief ministers over the province of Babylon , while Daniel himself remained at the royal court . Footnotes - Daniel 2:2 Or Chaldeans ; also in verses

NIVUK	Daniel	3	3	So the satraps , prefects , governors , advisors , treasurers , judges , magistrates and all the other provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up , and they stood before it .
NIVUK	Daniel	3	2	He then summoned the satraps , prefects , governors , advisors , treasurers , judges , magistrates and all the other provincial officials to come to the dedication of the image he had set up .
NIVUK	Daniel	3	4	Then the herald loudly proclaimed , ‘ Nations and peoples of every language , this is what you are commanded to do :
NIVUK	Daniel	3	5	as soon as you hear the sound of the horn , flute , zither , lyre , harp , pipe and all kinds of music , you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up .
NIVUK	Daniel	3	6	Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	3	7	Therefore , as soon as they heard the sound of the horn , flute , zither , lyre , harp and all kinds of music , all the nations and peoples of every language fell down and worshipped the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up .
NIVUK	Daniel	3	8	At this time some astrologers [ b ] came forward and denounced the Jews .
NIVUK	Daniel	3	9	They said to King Nebuchadnezzar , ‘ May the king live for ever !
NIVUK	Daniel	3	10	Your Majesty has issued a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn , flute , zither , lyre , harp , pipe and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold ,
NIVUK	Daniel	3	11	and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace .
NIVUK	Daniel	3	12	But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon – Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego – who pay no attention to you , Your Majesty . They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	3	13	Furious with rage , Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego . So these men were brought before the king ,
NIVUK	Daniel	3	14	and Nebuchadnezzar said to them , ‘ Is it true , Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego , that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold I have set up ?
NIVUK	Daniel	3	15	Now when you hear the sound of the horn , flute , zither , lyre , harp , pipe and all kinds of music , if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made , very good . But if you do not worship it , you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace . Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand ? ’
NIVUK	Daniel	3	16	Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego replied to him , ‘ King Nebuchadnezzar , we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter .
NIVUK	Daniel	3	17	If we are thrown into the blazing furnace , the God we serve is able to deliver us from it , and he will deliver us [ c ] from Your Majesty ’ s hand .
NIVUK	Daniel	3	18	But even if he does not , we want you to know , Your Majesty , that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	3	19	Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego , and his attitude towards them changed . He ordered the furnace to be heated seven times hotter than usual
NIVUK	Daniel	3	20	and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace .
NIVUK	Daniel	3	21	So these men , wearing their robes , trousers , turbans and other clothes , were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace .
NIVUK	Daniel	3	22	The king ’ s command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego ,
NIVUK	Daniel	3	23	and these three men , firmly tied , fell into the blazing furnace .
NIVUK	Daniel	3	24	Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisors , ‘ Weren ’ t there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire ? ’ They replied , ‘ Certainly , Your Majesty. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	3	25	He said , ‘ Look ! I see four men walking around in the fire , unbound and unharmed , and the fourth looks like a son of the gods. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	3	26	Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted , ‘ Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego , servants of the Most High God , come out ! Come here ! ’ So Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire ,

NIVUK	Daniel	3	28	Then Nebuchadnezzar said , ‘ Praise be to the God of Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego , who has sent his angel and rescued his servants !

NIVUK	Daniel	3	29	Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble , for no other god can save in this way. ’

NIVUK	Daniel	4	4	I , Nebuchadnezzar , was at home in my palace , contented and prosperous .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	2	It is my pleasure to tell you about the miraculous signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed for me .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	3	How great are his signs , how mighty his wonders ! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom ; his dominion endures from generation to generation .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	5	I had a dream that made me afraid . As I was lying in bed , the images and visions that passed through my mind terrified me .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	6	So I commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be brought before me to interpret the dream for me .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	7	When the magicians , enchanters , astrologers [ b ] and diviners came , I told them the dream , but they could not interpret it for me .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	8	Finally , Daniel came into my presence and I told him the dream . ( He is called Belteshazzar , after the name of my god , and the spirit of the holy gods is in him . )
NIVUK	Daniel	4	9	I said , ‘ Belteshazzar , chief of the magicians , I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you , and no mystery is too difficult for you . Here is my dream ; interpret it for me .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	10	These are the visions I saw while lying in bed : I looked , and there before me stood a tree in the middle of the land . Its height was enormous .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	11	The tree grew large and strong and its top touched the sky ; it was visible to the ends of the earth .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	12	Its leaves were beautiful , its fruit abundant , and on it was food for all . Under it the wild animals found shelter , and the birds lived in its branches ; from it every creature was fed .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	13	‘ In the visions I saw while lying in bed , I looked , and there before me was a holy one , a messenger , [ c ] coming down from heaven .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	14	He called in a loud voice : “ Cut down the tree and trim off its branches ; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit . Let the animals flee from under it and the birds from its branches .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	15	But let the stump and its roots , bound with iron and bronze , remain in the ground , in the grass of the field . ‘ “ Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven , and let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	16	Let his mind be changed from that of a man and let him be given the mind of an animal , till seven times [ d ] pass by for him .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	17	and
NIVUK	Daniel	4	18	‘ This is the dream that I , King Nebuchadnezzar , had . Now , Belteshazzar , tell me what it means , for none of the wise men in my kingdom can interpret it for me . But you can , because the spirit of the holy gods is in you. ’ Daniel interprets the dream
NIVUK	Daniel	4	19	Then Daniel ( also called Belteshazzar ) was greatly perplexed for a time , and his thoughts terrified him . So the king said , ‘ Belteshazzar , do not let the dream or its meaning alarm you. ’ Belteshazzar answered , ‘ My lord , if only the dream applied to your enemies and its meaning to your adversaries !
NIVUK	Daniel	4	20	The tree you saw , which grew large and strong , with its top touching the sky , visible to the whole earth ,
NIVUK	Daniel	4	21	with beautiful leaves and abundant fruit , providing food for all , giving shelter to the wild animals , and having nesting places in its branches for the birds –
NIVUK	Daniel	4	22	Your Majesty , you are that tree ! You have become great and strong ; your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky , and your dominion extends to distant parts of the earth .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	23	,
NIVUK	Daniel	4	24	‘ This is the interpretation , Your Majesty , and this is the decree the Most High has issued against my lord the king :
NIVUK	Daniel	4	25	and
NIVUK	Daniel	4	26	The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that Heaven rules .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	27	Therefore , Your Majesty , be pleased to accept my advice : renounce your sins by doing what is right , and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed . It may be that then your prosperity will continue. ’ The dream is fulfilled
NIVUK	Daniel	4	28	All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	29	Twelve months later , as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon ,
NIVUK	Daniel	4	30	he said , ‘ Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence , by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty ? ’
NIVUK	Daniel	4	31	Even as the words were on his lips , a voice came from heaven , ‘ This is what is decreed for you , King Nebuchadnezzar : your royal authority has been taken from you .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	32	Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	Daniel	4	33	Immediately what had been said about Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled . He was driven away from people and ate grass like the ox . His body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	34	At the end of that time , I , Nebuchadnezzar , raised my eyes towards heaven , and my sanity was restored . Then I praised the Most High ; I honoured and glorified him who lives for ever . His dominion is an eternal dominion ; his kingdom endures from generation to generation .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	35	All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing . He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth . No one can hold back his hand or say to him : ‘ What have you done ? ’
NIVUK	Daniel	4	36	At the same time that my sanity was restored , my honour and splendour were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom . My advisors and nobles sought me out , and I was restored to my throne and became even greater than before .
NIVUK	Daniel	4	37	Now I , Nebuchadnezzar , praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven , because everything he does is right and all his ways are just . And those who walk in pride he is able to humble .

NIVUK	Daniel	5	12	He did this because Daniel , whom the king called Belteshazzar , was found to have a keen mind and knowledge and understanding , and also the ability to interpret dreams , explain riddles and solve difficult problems .

NIVUK	Daniel	5	14	I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have insight , intelligence and outstanding wisdom .
NIVUK	Daniel	5	15	The wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this writing and tell me what it means , but they could not explain it .

NIVUK	Daniel	5	19	Because of the high position he gave him , all the nations and peoples of every language dreaded and feared him . Those the king wanted to put to death , he put to death ; those he wanted to spare , he spared ; those he wanted to promote , he promoted ; and those he wanted to humble , he humbled .
NIVUK	Daniel	5	20	But when his heart became arrogant and hardened with pride , he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory .
NIVUK	Daniel	5	21	He was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal ; he lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like the ox ; and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven , until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and sets over them anyone he wishes .
NIVUK	Daniel	5	22	‘ But you , Belshazzar , his son , [ d ] have not humbled yourself , though you knew all this .
NIVUK	Daniel	5	23	Instead , you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven . You had the goblets from his temple brought to you , and you and your nobles , your wives and your concubines drank wine from them . You praised the gods of silver and gold , of bronze , iron , wood and stone , which can not see or hear or understand . But you did not honour the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways .
NIVUK	Daniel	5	24	Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription .
NIVUK	Daniel	5	25	‘ This is the inscription that was written : mene , mene , tekel , parsin

NIVUK	Daniel	6	2	with three chief ministers over them , one of whom was Daniel . The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss .
NIVUK	Daniel	6	3	Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the chief ministers and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom .
NIVUK	Daniel	6	4	At this , the chief ministers and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs , but they were unable to do so . They could find no corruption in him , because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent .
NIVUK	Daniel	6	5	Finally these men said , ‘ We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	6	7	The royal ministers , prefects , satraps , advisors and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays to any god or human being during the next thirty days , except to you , Your Majesty , shall be thrown into the lions ’ den .

NIVUK	Daniel	6	9	So King Darius put the decree in writing .
NIVUK	Daniel	6	10	Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published , he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened towards Jerusalem . Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed , giving thanks to his God , just as he had done before .
NIVUK	Daniel	6	11	Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help .
NIVUK	Daniel	6	12	So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree : ‘ Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or human being except to you , Your Majesty , would be thrown into the lions ’ den ? ’ The king answered , ‘ The decree stands – in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians , which can not be repealed. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	6	13	Then they said to the king , ‘ Daniel , who is one of the exiles from Judah , pays no attention to you , Your Majesty , or to the decree you put in writing . He still prays three times a day. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	6	14	When the king heard this , he was greatly distressed ; he was determined to rescue Daniel and made every effort until sunset to save him .
NIVUK	Daniel	6	15	Then the men went as a group to King Darius and said to him , ‘ Remember , Your Majesty , that according to the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	6	16	So the king gave the order , and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions ’ den . The king said to Daniel , ‘ May your God , whom you serve continually , rescue you ! ’
NIVUK	Daniel	6	17	A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den , and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles , so that Daniel ’ s situation might not be changed .
NIVUK	Daniel	6	18	Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and without any entertainment being brought to him . And he could not sleep .

NIVUK	Daniel	6	20	When he came near the den , he called to Daniel in an anguished voice , ‘ Daniel , servant of the living God , has your God , whom you serve continually , been able to rescue you from the lions ? ’
NIVUK	Daniel	6	21	Daniel answered , ‘ May the king live for ever !
NIVUK	Daniel	6	22	My God sent his angel , and he shut the mouths of the lions . They have not hurt me , because I was found innocent in his sight . Nor have I ever done any wrong before you , Your Majesty. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	6	23	The king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den . And when Daniel was lifted from the den , no wound was found on him , because he had trusted in his God .
NIVUK	Daniel	6	24	At the king ’ s command , the men who had falsely accused Daniel were brought in and thrown into the lions ’ den , along with their wives and children . And before they reached the floor of the den , the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones .
NIVUK	Daniel	6	25	Then King Darius wrote to all the nations and peoples of every language in all the earth : ‘ May you prosper greatly !
NIVUK	Daniel	6	26	‘ I issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the God of Daniel . ‘ For he is the living God and he endures for ever ; his kingdom will not be destroyed , his dominion will never end .
NIVUK	Daniel	6	27	He rescues and he saves ; he performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth . He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	6	28	So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus [ b ] the Persian .

NIVUK	Daniel	7	7	‘ After that , in my vision at night I looked , and there before me was a fourth beast – terrifying and frightening and very powerful . It had large iron teeth ; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left . It was different from all the former beasts , and it had ten horns .
NIVUK	Daniel	7	2	Daniel said : ‘ In my vision at night I looked , and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea .
NIVUK	Daniel	7	3	Four great beasts , each different from the others , came up out of the sea .
NIVUK	Daniel	7	4	‘ The first was like a lion , and it had the wings of an eagle . I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a human being , and the mind of a human was given to it .
NIVUK	Daniel	7	5	‘ And there before me was a second beast , which looked like a bear . It was raised up on one of its sides , and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth . It was told , “ Get up and eat your fill of flesh ! ”
NIVUK	Daniel	7	6	‘ After that , I looked , and there before me was another beast , one that looked like a leopard . And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird . This beast had four heads , and it was given authority to rule .
NIVUK	Daniel	7	8	‘ While I was thinking about the horns , there before me was another horn , a little one , which came up among them ; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it . This horn had eyes like the eyes of a human being and a mouth that spoke boastfully .
NIVUK	Daniel	7	9	‘ As I looked , ‘ thrones were set in place , and the Ancient of Days took his seat . His clothing was as white as snow ; the hair of his head was white like wool . His throne was flaming with fire , and its wheels were all ablaze .
NIVUK	Daniel	7	10	A river of fire was flowing , coming out from before him . Thousands upon thousands attended him ; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him . The court was seated , and the books were opened .
NIVUK	Daniel	7	11	‘ Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking . I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire .
NIVUK	Daniel	7	12	( The other beasts had been stripped of their authority , but were allowed to live for a period of time . )
NIVUK	Daniel	7	13	‘ In my vision at night I looked , and there before me was one like a son of man , [ a ] coming with the clouds of heaven . He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence .
NIVUK	Daniel	7	14	He was given authority , glory and sovereign power ; all nations and peoples of every language worshipped him . His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away , and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed . The interpretation of the dream
NIVUK	Daniel	7	15	‘ I , Daniel , was troubled in spirit , and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me .
NIVUK	Daniel	7	16	I approached one of those standing there and asked him the meaning of all this . ‘ So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things :
NIVUK	Daniel	7	17	“ The four great beasts are four kings that will rise from the earth .
NIVUK	Daniel	7	18	But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it for ever – yes , for ever and ever. ”
NIVUK	Daniel	7	19	‘ Then I wanted to know the meaning of the fourth beast , which was different from all the others and most terrifying , with its iron teeth and bronze claws – the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left .
NIVUK	Daniel	7	20	I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up , before which three of them fell – the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully .
NIVUK	Daniel	7	21	As I watched , this horn was waging war against the holy people and defeating them ,
NIVUK	Daniel	7	22	until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favour of the holy people of the Most High , and the time came when they possessed the kingdom .
NIVUK	Daniel	7	23	‘ He gave me this explanation : “ The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth . It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth , trampling it down and crushing it .
NIVUK	Daniel	7	24	The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom . After them another king will arise , different from the earlier ones ; he will subdue three kings .
NIVUK	Daniel	7	25	He will speak against the Most High and oppress his holy people and try to change the set times and the laws . The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time , times and half a time . [ b ]
NIVUK	Daniel	7	26	‘ “ But the court will sit , and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed for ever .
NIVUK	Daniel	7	27	Then the sovereignty , power and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be handed over to the holy people of the Most High . His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom , and all rulers will worship and obey him. ”
NIVUK	Daniel	7	28	‘ This is the end of the matter . I , Daniel , was deeply troubled by my thoughts , and my face turned pale , but I kept the matter to myself. ’ Footnotes - Daniel 7:13 The Aramaic phrase bar enash means human being .

NIVUK	Daniel	8	8	The goat became very great , but at the height of its power the large horn was broken off , and in its place four prominent horns grew up towards the four winds of heaven .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	2	In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam ; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	3	I looked up , and there before me was a ram with two horns , standing beside the canal , and the horns were long . One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	4	I watched the ram as it charged towards the west and the north and the south . No animal could stand against it , and none could rescue from its power . It did as it pleased and became great .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	5	As I was thinking about this , suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between its eyes came from the west , crossing the whole earth without touching the ground .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	6	It came towards the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at it in great rage .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	7	I saw it attack the ram furiously , striking the ram and shattering its two horns . The ram was powerless to stand against it ; the goat knocked it to the ground and trampled on it , and none could rescue the ram from its power .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	9	Out of one of them came another horn , which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and towards the Beautiful Land .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	10	It grew until it reached the host of the heavens , and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	11	It set itself up to be as great as the commander of the army of the Lord ; it took away the daily sacrifice from the Lord , and his sanctuary was thrown down .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	12	Because of rebellion , the Lord ’ s people [ a ] and the daily sacrifice were given over to it . It prospered in everything it did , and truth was thrown to the ground .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	13	Then I heard a holy one speaking , and another holy one said to him , ‘ How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled – the vision concerning the daily sacrifice , the rebellion that causes desolation , the surrender of the sanctuary and the trampling underfoot of the Lord ’ s people ? ’
NIVUK	Daniel	8	14	He said to me , ‘ It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings ; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated. ’ The interpretation of the vision
NIVUK	Daniel	8	15	While I , Daniel , was watching the vision and trying to understand it , there before me stood one who looked like a man .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	16	And I heard a man ’ s voice from the Ulai calling , ‘ Gabriel , tell this man the meaning of the vision. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	8	17	As he came near the place where I was standing , I was terrified and fell prostrate . ‘ Son of man , ’ [ b ] he said to me , ‘ understand that the vision concerns the time of the end. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	8	18	While he was speaking to me , I was in a deep sleep , with my face to the ground . Then he touched me and raised me to my feet .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	19	He said : ‘ I am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath , because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end . [ c ]
NIVUK	Daniel	8	20	The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	21	The shaggy goat is the king of Greece , and the large horn between its eyes is the first king .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	22	The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	23	‘ In the latter part of their reign , when rebels have become completely wicked , a fierce-looking king , a master of intrigue , will arise .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	24	He will become very strong , but not by his own power . He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does . He will destroy those who are mighty , the holy people .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	25	He will cause deceit to prosper , and he will consider himself superior . When they feel secure , he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes . Yet he will be destroyed , but not by human power .
NIVUK	Daniel	8	26	‘ The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true , but seal up the vision , for it concerns the distant future. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	8	27	I , Daniel , was worn out . I lay exhausted for several days . Then I got up and went about the king ’ s business . I was appalled by the vision ; it was beyond understanding .

NIVUK	Daniel	9	9	The Lord our God is merciful and forgiving , even though we have rebelled against him ;
NIVUK	Daniel	9	2	in the first year of his reign , I , Daniel , understood from the Scriptures , according to the word of the Lord given to Jeremiah the prophet , that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years .
NIVUK	Daniel	9	3	So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition , in fasting , and in sackcloth and ashes .
NIVUK	Daniel	9	4	I prayed to the Lord my God and confessed : ‘ Lord , the great and awesome God , who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments ,
NIVUK	Daniel	9	5	we have sinned and done wrong . We have been wicked and have rebelled ; we have turned away from your commands and laws .
NIVUK	Daniel	9	6	We have not listened to your servants the prophets , who spoke in your name to our kings , our princes and our ancestors , and to all the people of the land .
NIVUK	Daniel	9	7	‘ Lord , you are righteous , but this day we are covered with shame – the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel , both near and far , in all the countries where you have scattered us because of our unfaithfulness to you .
NIVUK	Daniel	9	8	We and our kings , our princes and our ancestors are covered with shame , Lord , because we have sinned against you .
NIVUK	Daniel	9	10	we have not obeyed the Lord our God or kept the laws he gave us through his servants the prophets .
NIVUK	Daniel	9	11	All Israel has transgressed your law and turned away , refusing to obey you . ‘ Therefore the curses and sworn judgments written in the Law of Moses , the servant of God , have been poured out on us , because we have sinned against you .
NIVUK	Daniel	9	12	You have fulfilled the words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing on us great disaster . Under the whole heaven nothing has ever been done like what has been done to Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Daniel	9	13	Just as it is written in the Law of Moses , all this disaster has come on us , yet we have not sought the favour of the Lord our God by turning from our sins and giving attention to your truth .
NIVUK	Daniel	9	14	The Lord did not hesitate to bring the disaster on us , for the Lord our God is righteous in everything he does ; yet we have not obeyed him .
NIVUK	Daniel	9	15	‘ Now , Lord our God , who brought your people out of Egypt with a mighty hand and who made for yourself a name that endures to this day , we have sinned , we have done wrong .
NIVUK	Daniel	9	16	Lord , in keeping with all your righteous acts , turn away your anger and your wrath from Jerusalem , your city , your holy hill . Our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors have made Jerusalem and your people an object of scorn to all those around us .
NIVUK	Daniel	9	17	‘ Now , our God , hear the prayers and petitions of your servant . For your sake , Lord , look with favour on your desolate sanctuary .
NIVUK	Daniel	9	18	Give ear , our God , and hear ; open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your Name . We do not make requests of you because we are righteous , but because of your great mercy .

NIVUK	Daniel	9	20	While I was speaking and praying , confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and making my request to the Lord my God for his holy hill –
NIVUK	Daniel	9	21	while I was still in prayer , Gabriel , the man I had seen in the earlier vision , came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice .
NIVUK	Daniel	9	22	He instructed me and said to me , ‘ Daniel , I have now come to give you insight and understanding .
NIVUK	Daniel	9	23	As soon as you began to pray , a word went out , which I have come to tell you , for you are highly esteemed . Therefore , consider the word and understand the vision :

NIVUK	Daniel	10	10	A hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees .
NIVUK	Daniel	10	2	At that time I , Daniel , mourned for three weeks .
NIVUK	Daniel	10	3	I ate no choice food ; no meat or wine touched my lips ; and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over .
NIVUK	Daniel	10	4	On the twenty-fourth day of the first month , as I was standing on the bank of the great river , the Tigris ,
NIVUK	Daniel	10	5	I looked up and there before me was a man dressed in linen , with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz round his waist .
NIVUK	Daniel	10	6	His body was like topaz , his face like lightning , his eyes like flaming torches , his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze , and his voice like the sound of a multitude .
NIVUK	Daniel	10	7	I , Daniel , was the only one who saw the vision ; those who were with me did not see it , but such terror overwhelmed them that they fled and hid themselves .
NIVUK	Daniel	10	8	So I was left alone , gazing at this great vision ; I had no strength left , my face turned deathly pale and I was helpless .
NIVUK	Daniel	10	9	Then I heard him speaking , and as I listened to him , I fell into a deep sleep , my face to the ground .
NIVUK	Daniel	10	11	He said , ‘ Daniel , you who are highly esteemed , consider carefully the words I am about to speak to you , and stand up , for I have now been sent to you. ’ And when he said this to me , I stood up trembling .
NIVUK	Daniel	10	12	Then he continued , ‘ Do not be afraid , Daniel . Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God , your words were heard , and I have come in response to them .
NIVUK	Daniel	10	13	But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days . Then Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me , because I was detained there with the king of Persia .
NIVUK	Daniel	10	14	Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future , for the vision concerns a time yet to come. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	10	15	While he was saying this to me , I bowed with my face towards the ground and was speechless .
NIVUK	Daniel	10	16	Then one who looked like a man [ b ] touched my lips , and I opened my mouth and began to speak . I said to the one standing before me , ‘ I am overcome with anguish because of the vision , my lord , and I feel very weak .
NIVUK	Daniel	10	17	How can I , your servant , talk with you , my lord ? My strength is gone and I can hardly breathe. ’
NIVUK	Daniel	10	18	Again the one who looked like a man touched me and gave me strength .
NIVUK	Daniel	10	19	‘ Do not be afraid , you who are highly esteemed , ’ he said . ‘ Peace ! Be strong now ; be strong. ’ When he spoke to me , I was strengthened and said , ‘ Speak , my lord , since you have given me strength. ’

NIVUK	Daniel	11	4	After he has arisen , his empire will be broken up and parcelled out towards the four winds of heaven . It will not go to his descendants , nor will it have the power he exercised , because his empire will be uprooted and given to others .

NIVUK	Daniel	11	9	Then the king of the North will invade the realm of the king of the South but will retreat to his own country .
NIVUK	Daniel	11	10	His sons will prepare for war and assemble a great army , which will sweep on like an irresistible flood and carry the battle as far as his fortress .
NIVUK	Daniel	11	12	When the army is carried off , the king of the South will be filled with pride and will slaughter many thousands , yet he will not remain triumphant .

NIVUK	Daniel	11	23	After coming to an agreement with him , he will act deceitfully , and with only a few people he will rise to power .
NIVUK	Daniel	11	24	When the richest provinces feel secure , he will invade them and will achieve what neither his fathers nor his forefathers did . He will distribute plunder , loot and wealth among his followers . He will plot the overthrow of fortresses – but only for a time .
NIVUK	Daniel	11	25	‘ With a large army he will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South . The king of the South will wage war with a large and very powerful army , but he will not be able to stand because of the plots devised against him .

NIVUK	Daniel	11	37	He will show no regard for the gods of his ancestors or for the one desired by women , nor will he regard any god , but will exalt himself above them all .
NIVUK	Daniel	11	38	Instead of them , he will honour a god of fortresses ; a god unknown to his ancestors he will honour with gold and silver , with precious stones and costly gifts .

NIVUK	Hosea	1	1	The word of the Lord that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , and during the reign of Jeroboam son of Joash king of Israel : Hosea ’ s wife and children
NIVUK	Hosea	1	2	When the Lord began to speak through Hosea , the Lord said to him , ‘ Go , marry a promiscuous woman and have children with her , for like an adulterous wife this land is guilty of unfaithfulness to the Lord. ’
NIVUK	Hosea	1	3	So he married Gomer daughter of Diblaim , and she conceived and bore him a son .
NIVUK	Hosea	1	4	Then the Lord said to Hosea , ‘ Call him Jezreel , because I will soon punish the house of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel , and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel .
NIVUK	Hosea	1	5	In that day I will break Israel ’ s bow in the Valley of Jezreel. ’
NIVUK	Hosea	1	6	Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter . Then the Lord said to Hosea , ‘ Call her Lo-Ruhamah ( which means “ not loved ” ) , for I will no longer show love to Israel , that I should at all forgive them .
NIVUK	Hosea	1	7	Yet I will show love to Judah ; and I will save them – not by bow , sword or battle , or by horses and horsemen , but I , the Lord their God , will save them. ’
NIVUK	Hosea	1	8	After she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah , Gomer had another son .
NIVUK	Hosea	1	9	Then the Lord said , ‘ Call him Lo-Ammi ( which means “ not my people ” ) , for you are not my people , and I am not your God . [ a ]

NIVUK	Hosea	4	13	They sacrifice on the mountaintops and burn offerings on the hills , under oak , poplar and terebinth , where the shade is pleasant . Therefore your daughters turn to prostitution and your daughters-in-law to adultery .
NIVUK	Hosea	4	14	‘ I will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution , nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery , because the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine-prostitutes – a people without understanding will come to ruin !

NIVUK	Joel	2	21	Do not be afraid , land of Judah ; be glad and rejoice . Surely the Lord has done great things !

NIVUK	Amos	5	2	‘ Fallen is Virgin Israel , never to rise again , deserted in her own land , with no one to lift her up. ’
NIVUK	Amos	5	3	This is what the Sovereign Lord says to Israel : ‘ Your city that marches out a thousand strong will have only a hundred left ; your town that marches out a hundred strong will have only ten left. ’
NIVUK	Amos	5	4	This is what the Lord says to Israel : ‘ Seek me and live ;
NIVUK	Amos	5	6	Seek the Lord and live , or he will sweep through the tribes of Joseph like a fire ; it will devour them , and Bethel will have no one to quench it .

NIVUK	Amos	5	8	He who made the Pleiades and Orion , who turns midnight into dawn and darkens day into night , who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land – the Lord is his name .
NIVUK	Amos	5	9	With a blinding flash he destroys the stronghold and brings the fortified city to ruin .
NIVUK	Amos	5	10	There are those who hate the one who upholds justice in court and detest the one who tells the truth .

NIVUK	Amos	5	15	Hate evil , love good ; maintain justice in the courts . Perhaps the Lord God Almighty will have mercy on the remnant of Joseph .

NIVUK	Amos	7	3	So the Lord relented . ‘ This will not happen , ’ the Lord said .

NIVUK	Micah	1	6	‘ Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble , a place for planting vineyards . I will pour her stones into the valley and lay bare her foundations .
NIVUK	Micah	1	7	All her idols will be broken to pieces ; all her temple gifts will be burned with fire ; I will destroy all her images . Since she gathered her gifts from the wages of prostitutes , as the wages of prostitutes they will again be used. ’ Weeping and mourning
NIVUK	Micah	1	8	Because of this I will weep and wail ; I will go about barefoot and naked . I will howl like a jackal and moan like an owl .
NIVUK	Micah	1	9	For Samaria ’ s plague is incurable ; it has spread to Judah . It has reached the very gate of my people , even to Jerusalem itself .
NIVUK	Micah	1	10	Tell it not in Gath ; [ a ] weep not at all . In Beth Ophrah [ b ] roll in the dust .
NIVUK	Micah	1	11	Pass by naked and in shame , you who live in Shaphir . [ c ] Those who live in Zaanan [ d ] will not come out . Beth Ezel is in mourning ; it no longer protects you .
NIVUK	Micah	1	12	Those who live in Maroth [ e ] writhe in pain , waiting for relief , because disaster has come from the Lord , even to the gate of Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Micah	1	13	You who live in Lachish , harness fast horses to the chariot . You are where the sin of Daughter Zion began , for the transgressions of Israel were found in you .
NIVUK	Micah	1	14	Therefore you will give parting gifts to Moresheth Gath . The town of Akzib [ f ] will prove deceptive to the kings of Israel .
NIVUK	Micah	1	15	I will bring a conqueror against you who live in Mareshah . [ g ] The nobles of Israel will flee to Adullam .
NIVUK	Micah	1	16	Shave your head in mourning for the children in whom you delight ; make yourself as bald as the vulture , for they will go from you into exile . Footnotes - Micah 1:10 Gath sounds like the Hebrew for tell . - Micah 1:10 Beth Ophrah means house of dust . - Micah 1:11 Shaphir means pleasant . - Micah 1:11 Zaanan sounds like the Hebrew for come out . - Micah 1:12 Maroth sounds like the Hebrew for bitter . - Micah 1:14 Akzib means deception . - Micah 1:15 Mareshah sounds like the Hebrew for conqueror .

NIVUK	Micah	2	2	They covet fields and seize them , and houses , and take them . They defraud people of their homes , they rob them of their inheritance .
NIVUK	Micah	2	3	Therefore , the Lord says : ‘ I am planning disaster against this people , from which you can not save yourselves . You will no longer walk proudly , for it will be a time of calamity .
NIVUK	Micah	2	4	In that day people will ridicule you ; they will taunt you with this mournful song : “ We are utterly ruined ; my people ’ s possession is divided up . He takes it from me ! He assigns our fields to traitors. ” ’
NIVUK	Micah	2	5	Therefore you will have no one in the assembly of the Lord to divide the land by lot . False prophets
NIVUK	Micah	2	6	‘ Do not prophesy , ’ their prophets say . ‘ Do not prophesy about these things ; disgrace will not overtake us. ’
NIVUK	Micah	2	7	You descendants of Jacob , should it be said , ‘ Does the Lord become [ a ] impatient ? Does he do such things ? ’ ‘ Do not my words do good to the one whose ways are upright ?
NIVUK	Micah	2	8	Lately my people have risen up like an enemy . You strip off the rich robe from those who pass by without a care , like men returning from battle .
NIVUK	Micah	2	9	You drive the women of my people from their pleasant homes . You take away my blessing from their children for ever .
NIVUK	Micah	2	10	Get up , go away ! For this is not your resting place , because it is defiled , it is ruined , beyond all remedy .
NIVUK	Micah	2	11	If a liar and deceiver comes and says , “ I will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer , ” that would be just the prophet for this people ! Deliverance promised

NIVUK	Micah	3	3	who eat my people ’ s flesh , strip off their skin and break their bones in pieces ; who chop them up like meat for the pan , like flesh for the pot. ’
NIVUK	Micah	3	2	you who hate good and love evil ; who tear the skin from my people and the flesh from their bones ;
NIVUK	Micah	3	4	Then they will cry out to the Lord , but he will not answer them . At that time he will hide his face from them because of the evil they have done .
NIVUK	Micah	3	5	This is what the Lord says : ‘ As for the prophets who lead my people astray , they proclaim “ peace ” if they have something to eat , but prepare to wage war against anyone who refuses to feed them .
NIVUK	Micah	3	6	Therefore night will come over you , without visions , and darkness , without divination . The sun will set for the prophets , and the day will go dark for them .
NIVUK	Micah	3	7	The seers will be ashamed and the diviners disgraced . They will all cover their faces because there is no answer from God. ’
NIVUK	Micah	3	8	But as for me , I am filled with power , with the Spirit of the Lord , and with justice and might , to declare to Jacob his transgression , to Israel his sin .
NIVUK	Micah	3	9	Hear this , you leaders of Jacob , you rulers of Israel , who despise justice and distort all that is right ;
NIVUK	Micah	3	10	who build Zion with bloodshed , and Jerusalem with wickedness .
NIVUK	Micah	3	11	Her leaders judge for a bribe , her priests teach for a price , and her prophets tell fortunes for money . Yet they look for the Lord ’ s support and say , ‘ Is not the Lord among us ? No disaster will come upon us. ’

NIVUK	Micah	4	3	He will judge between many peoples and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide . They will beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks . Nation will not take up sword against nation , nor will they train for war any more .

NIVUK	Micah	4	9	Why do you now cry aloud – have you no king ? [ b ] Has your ruler [ c ] perished , that pain seizes you like that of a woman in labour ?
NIVUK	Micah	4	10	Writhe in agony , Daughter Zion , like a woman in labour , for now you must leave the city to camp in the open field . You will go to Babylon ; there you will be rescued . There the Lord will redeem you out of the hand of your enemies .
NIVUK	Micah	4	11	But now many nations are gathered against you . They say , ‘ Let her be defiled , let our eyes gloat over Zion ! ’
NIVUK	Micah	4	12	But they do not know the thoughts of the Lord ; they do not understand his plan , that he has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing-floor .
NIVUK	Micah	4	13	‘ Rise and thresh , Daughter Zion , for I will give you horns of iron ; I will give you hooves of bronze , and you will break to pieces many nations. ’ You will devote their ill-gotten gains to the Lord , their wealth to the Lord of all the earth .

NIVUK	Micah	7	7	But as for me , I watch in hope for the Lord , I wait for God my Saviour ; my God will hear me . Israel will rise
NIVUK	Micah	7	2	The faithful have been swept from the land ; not one upright person remains . Everyone lies in wait to shed blood ; they hunt each other with nets .
NIVUK	Micah	7	3	Both hands are skilled in doing evil ; the ruler demands gifts , the judge accepts bribes , the powerful dictate what they desire – they all conspire together .
NIVUK	Micah	7	4	The best of them is like a brier , the most upright worse than a thorn hedge . The day God visits you has come , the day your watchmen sound the alarm . Now is the time of your confusion .
NIVUK	Micah	7	5	Do not trust a neighbour ; put no confidence in a friend . Even with the woman who lies in your embrace guard the words of your lips .
NIVUK	Micah	7	6	For a son dishonours his father , a daughter rises up against her mother , a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law – a man ’ s enemies are the members of his own household .
NIVUK	Micah	7	8	Do not gloat over me , my enemy ! Though I have fallen , I will rise . Though I sit in darkness , the Lord will be my light .
NIVUK	Micah	7	9	Because I have sinned against him , I will bear the Lord ’ s wrath , until he pleads my case and upholds my cause . He will bring me out into the light ; I will see his righteousness .

NIVUK	Nahum	1	1	A prophecy concerning Nineveh . The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite . The Lord ’ s anger against Nineveh
NIVUK	Nahum	1	2	The Lord is a jealous and avenging God ; the Lord takes vengeance and is filled with wrath . The Lord takes vengeance on his foes and vents his wrath against his enemies .
NIVUK	Nahum	1	3	The Lord is slow to anger but great in power ; the Lord will not leave the guilty unpunished . His way is in the whirlwind and the storm , and clouds are the dust of his feet .
NIVUK	Nahum	1	4	He rebukes the sea and dries it up ; he makes all the rivers run dry . Bashan and Carmel wither and the blossoms of Lebanon fade .
NIVUK	Nahum	1	5	The mountains quake before him and the hills melt away . The earth trembles at his presence , the world and all who live in it .
NIVUK	Nahum	1	6	Who can withstand his indignation ? Who can endure his fierce anger ? His wrath is poured out like fire ; the rocks are shattered before him .
NIVUK	Nahum	1	7	The Lord is good , a refuge in times of trouble . He cares for those who trust in him ,
NIVUK	Nahum	1	8	but with an overwhelming flood he will make an end of Nineveh ; he will pursue his foes into the realm of darkness .
NIVUK	Nahum	1	9	Whatever they plot against the Lord he will bring [ a ] to an end ; trouble will not come a second time .
NIVUK	Nahum	1	10	They will be entangled among thorns and drunk from their wine ; they will be consumed like dry stubble . [ b ]
NIVUK	Nahum	1	11	From you , Nineveh , has one come forth who plots evil against the Lord and devises wicked plans .
NIVUK	Nahum	1	12	This is what the Lord says : ‘ Although they have allies and are numerous , they will be destroyed and pass away . Although I have afflicted you , Judah , I will afflict you no more .
NIVUK	Nahum	1	13	Now I will break their yoke from your neck and tear your shackles away. ’
NIVUK	Nahum	1	14	The Lord has given a command concerning you , Nineveh : ‘ You will have no descendants to bear your name . I will destroy the images and idols that are in the temple of your gods . I will prepare your grave , for you are vile. ’
NIVUK	Nahum	1	15	Look , there on the mountains , the feet of one who brings good news , who proclaims peace ! Celebrate your festivals , Judah , and fulfil your vows . No more will the wicked invade you ; they will be completely destroyed .

NIVUK	Nahum	2	3	The shields of the soldiers are red ; the warriors are clad in scarlet . The metal on the chariots flashes on the day they are made ready ; the spears of juniper are brandished . [ b ]
NIVUK	Nahum	2	4	The chariots storm through the streets , rushing back and forth through the squares . They look like flaming torches ; they dart about like lightning .
NIVUK	Nahum	2	5	Nineveh summons her picked troops , yet they stumble on their way . They dash to the city wall ; the protective shield is put in place .
NIVUK	Nahum	2	6	The river gates are thrown open and the palace collapses .
NIVUK	Nahum	2	7	It is decreed [ c ] that Nineveh be exiled and carried away . Her female slaves moan like doves and beat on their breasts .
NIVUK	Nahum	2	8	Nineveh is like a pool whose water is draining away . ‘ Stop ! Stop ! ’ they cry , but no one turns back .
NIVUK	Nahum	2	9	Plunder the silver ! Plunder the gold ! The supply is endless , the wealth from all its treasures !
NIVUK	Nahum	2	10	She is pillaged , plundered , stripped ! Hearts melt , knees give way , bodies tremble , every face grows pale .
NIVUK	Nahum	2	11	Where now is the lions ’ den , the place where they fed their young , where the lion and lioness went , and the cubs , with nothing to fear ?
NIVUK	Nahum	2	12	The lion killed enough for his cubs and strangled the prey for his mate , filling his lairs with the kill and his dens with the prey .
NIVUK	Nahum	2	13	‘ I am against you , ’ declares the Lord Almighty . ‘ I will burn up your chariots in smoke , and the sword will devour your young lions . I will leave you no prey on the earth .

NIVUK	Nahum	3	9	Cush [ a ] and Egypt were her boundless strength ; Put and Libya were among her allies .
NIVUK	Nahum	3	10	Yet she was taken captive and went into exile . Her infants were dashed to pieces at every street corner . Lots were cast for her nobles , and all her great men were put in chains .
NIVUK	Nahum	3	11	You too will become drunk ; you will go into hiding and seek refuge from the enemy .
NIVUK	Nahum	3	12	All your fortresses are like fig-trees with their first ripe fruit ; when they are shaken , the figs fall into the mouth of the eater .
NIVUK	Nahum	3	13	Look at your troops – they are all weaklings . The gates of your land are wide open to your enemies ; fire has consumed the bars of your gates .
NIVUK	Nahum	3	14	Draw water for the siege , strengthen your defences ! Work the clay , tread the mortar , repair the brickwork !
NIVUK	Nahum	3	15	There the fire will consume you ; the sword will cut you down – and it will devour you like a swarm of locusts . Multiply like grasshoppers , multiply like locusts !
NIVUK	Nahum	3	16	You have increased the number of your merchants till they are more numerous than the stars in the sky , but like locusts they strip the land and then fly away .
NIVUK	Nahum	3	17	Your guards are like locusts , your officials like swarms of locusts that settle in the walls on a cold day – but when the sun appears they fly away , and no one knows where .
NIVUK	Nahum	3	18	King of Assyria , your shepherds [ b ] slumber ; your nobles lie down to rest . Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them .
NIVUK	Nahum	3	19	Nothing can heal you ; your wound is fatal . All who hear the news about you clap their hands at your fall , for who has not felt your endless cruelty ?

NIVUK	Habakkuk	1	1	The prophecy that Habakkuk the prophet received . Habakkuk ’ s complaint
NIVUK	Habakkuk	1	2	How long , Lord , must I call for help , but you do not listen ? Or cry out to you , ‘ Violence ! ’ but you do not save ?
NIVUK	Habakkuk	1	3	Why do you make me look at injustice ? Why do you tolerate wrongdoing ? Destruction and violence are before me ; there is strife , and conflict abounds .
NIVUK	Habakkuk	1	4	Therefore the law is paralysed , and justice never prevails . The wicked hem in the righteous , so that justice is perverted . The Lord ’ s answer
NIVUK	Habakkuk	1	5	‘ Look at the nations and watch – and be utterly amazed . For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe , even if you were told .
NIVUK	Habakkuk	1	6	I am raising up the Babylonians , [ a ] that ruthless and impetuous people , who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwellings not their own .
NIVUK	Habakkuk	1	7	They are a feared and dreaded people ; they are a law to themselves and promote their own honour .
NIVUK	Habakkuk	1	8	Their horses are swifter than leopards , fiercer than wolves at dusk . Their cavalry gallops headlong ; their horsemen come from afar . They fly like an eagle swooping to devour ;
NIVUK	Habakkuk	1	9	they all come intent on violence . Their hordes [ b ] advance like a desert wind and gather prisoners like sand .
NIVUK	Habakkuk	1	10	They mock kings and scoff at rulers . They laugh at all fortified cities ; by building earthen ramps they capture them .
NIVUK	Habakkuk	1	11	Then they sweep past like the wind and go on – guilty people , whose own strength is their god. ’ Habakkuk ’ s second complaint
NIVUK	Habakkuk	1	12	Lord , are you not from everlasting ? My God , my Holy One , you [ c ] will never die . You , Lord , have appointed them to execute judgment ; you , my Rock , have ordained them to punish .
NIVUK	Habakkuk	1	13	Your eyes are too pure to look on evil ; you can not tolerate wrongdoing . Why then do you tolerate the treacherous ? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves ?
NIVUK	Habakkuk	1	14	You have made people like the fish in the sea , like the sea creatures that have no ruler .
NIVUK	Habakkuk	1	15	The wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks , he catches them in his net , he gathers them up in his drag-net ; and so he rejoices and is glad .
