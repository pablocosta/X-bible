MOUNCE	John	11	2	It was eimi · de this Mary Mariam who ho anointed aleiphō the ho Lord kyrios with ointment myron and kai wiped ekmassō · ho his autos feet pous with ho her autos hair thrix , whose hos · ho brother adelphos Lazarus Lazaros was ill astheneō .
MOUNCE	John	11	3	So oun the ho sisters adelphē sent apostellō word to pros him autos , saying legō , “ Lord kyrios , the one hos you love phileō is ill astheneō. ”
MOUNCE	John	11	4	But de when Jesus Iēsous heard akouō · ho this , he said legō , “ This houtos · ho illness astheneia will not ou lead eimi to pros death thanatos , but alla is for hyper the ho glory doxa of ho God theos , that hina the ho Son hyios of ho God theos may be glorified doxazō through dia it autos. ”
MOUNCE	John	11	5	Now de Jesus Iēsous loved agapaō · ho · ho Martha Martha and kai · ho her autos sister adelphē and kai · ho Lazarus Lazaros .
MOUNCE	John	11	6	So oun when hōs he heard akouō that hoti Lazarus was ill astheneō , he stayed menō in topos the place topos where en hos he was eimi for two dyo more days hēmera .
MOUNCE	John	11	7	Then epeita after meta this houtos he said legō to the ho disciples mathētēs , “ Let us go agō to eis · ho Judea Ioudaia again palin. ”
MOUNCE	John	11	8	The ho disciples mathētēs said legō to him autos , “ Rabbi rhabbi , just nyn recently the ho Jews Ioudaios were trying zēteō to stone lithazō you sy , and kai are you going back hypagō there ekei again palin ? ”
MOUNCE	John	11	9	Jesus Iēsous answered apokrinomai , “ Are there eimi not ouchi twelve dōdeka hours hōra in ho a day hēmera ? If ean a person tis walks peripateō during en the ho day hēmera , he will not ou stumble proskoptō , because hoti he sees blepō the ho light phōs of ho this houtos world kosmos .
MOUNCE	John	11	10	But de if ean someone tis walks peripateō during en the ho night nyx , he will stumble proskoptō , because hoti the ho light phōs is eimi not ou in en him autos. ”
MOUNCE	John	11	12	The ho disciples mathētēs therefore oun said legō to him autos , “ Lord kyrios , if ei he has fallen asleep koimaō , he will recover sōzō. ”
MOUNCE	John	11	13	Jesus Iēsous , however de , had been speaking legō · ho of peri · ho his autos death thanatos , but de they ekeinos thought dokeō that hoti he was speaking legō about peri · ho sleep koimēsis in the sense of ho slumber hypnos .
MOUNCE	John	11	14	Then tote oun Jesus Iēsous told legō them autos · ho plainly parrēsia , “ Lazarus Lazaros has died apothnēskō ,
MOUNCE	John	11	15	and kai for dia your hymeis sake dia that hina you might believe pisteuō , I am glad chairō that hoti I was eimi not ou there ekei . But alla let us go agō to pros him autos. ”
MOUNCE	John	11	16	So oun Thomas Thōmas ( called legō the Twin Didymos ) , said legō · ho to his ho fellow symmathētēs disciples , “ Let us also kai go agō , that hina we hēmeis may die apothnēskō with meta him autos. ”
MOUNCE	John	11	17	Now oun when Jesus Iēsous arrived erchomai , · ho he found heuriskō that Lazarus autos had echō already ēdē been echō in en the ho tomb mnēmeion for four tessares days hēmera .
MOUNCE	John	11	18	Bethany Bēthania was eimi · de · ho near engys · ho Jerusalem Hierosolyma , about hōs two miles stadion away apo ,
MOUNCE	John	11	19	and de many polys of ek the ho Jews Ioudaios had come erchomai to pros · ho Martha Martha and kai Mary Mariam to hina console paramytheomai them autos in regard peri to their ho brother adelphos .
MOUNCE	John	11	20	· ho So oun when hōs Martha Martha heard akouō that hoti Jesus Iēsous was coming erchomai , she went hypantaō out to meet him autos , but de Mary Mariam remained kathezomai in en the ho house oikos .
MOUNCE	John	11	21	Martha Martha then oun said legō · ho to pros · ho Jesus Iēsous , “ Lord kyrios , if ei you had been eimi here hōde , my egō brother adelphos would an not ou have died apothnēskō . · ho
MOUNCE	John	11	22	But alla even kai now nyn I know oida that hoti God theos will give didōmi you sy whatever hosos an you ask aiteō of · ho him theos. ” · ho
MOUNCE	John	11	23	Jesus Iēsous said legō to her autos , · ho “ Your sy brother adelphos will rise anistēmi again . ” · ho
MOUNCE	John	11	24	Martha Martha said legō to him autos , · ho “ I know oida that hoti he will rise anistēmi again in en the ho resurrection anastasis at en the ho last eschatos day hēmera. ”
MOUNCE	John	11	25	Jesus Iēsous said legō to her autos , · ho “ I egō am eimi the ho resurrection anastasis and kai the ho life zōē . The ho one who believes pisteuō in eis me egō , even kan though he die apothnēskō , yet will he live zaō ,
MOUNCE	John	11	26	and kai everyone pas who ho lives zaō and kai believes pisteuō in eis me egō will never ou mē die apothnēskō . Do you believe pisteuō this houtos ? ”
MOUNCE	John	11	27	She said legō to him autos , “ Yes nai , Lord kyrios ; I egō firmly believe pisteuō that hoti you sy are eimi the ho Christ Christos , the ho Son hyios of ho God theos , the ho one who was to come erchomai into eis the ho world kosmos. ”
MOUNCE	John	11	28	And kai when she had said legō this houtos , she went aperchomai back and kai spoke phōneō privately lathrai to her autos sister adelphē Mary Mariam , · ho saying legō , “ The ho Teacher didaskalos is here pareimi and kai is asking phōneō for you sy. ”
MOUNCE	John	11	29	So de when hōs Mary heard akouō this ekeinos , she got egeirō up quickly tachus and kai went erchomai to pros him autos .
MOUNCE	John	11	30	Now de Jesus Iēsous had not oupō yet entered erchomai · ho the ho village kōmē , but alla was eimi still eti in en the ho place topos where hopou Martha Martha had met hypantaō him autos . · ho
MOUNCE	John	11	31	When the ho Jews Ioudaios , who ho were eimi with meta Mary autos in en the ho house oikia · kai consoling paramytheomai her autos saw · ho that hoti she had gotten up anistēmi quickly tacheōs and kai gone exerchomai out , they followed akoloutheō her autos , assuming dokeō that hoti she was going hypagō to eis the ho tomb mnēmeion to hina weep klaiō there ekei .
MOUNCE	John	11	32	· ho When hōs Mary Mariam came erchomai to where hopou Jesus Iēsous was eimi and saw him autos , she fell piptō at pros his autos · ho feet pous , saying legō to him autos , “ Lord kyrios , if ei you had been eimi here hōde , my egō brother adelphos would an not ou have died apothnēskō. ” · ho
MOUNCE	John	11	33	When hōs Jesus Iēsous saw her autos weeping klaiō , and kai the ho Jews Ioudaios who had come synerchomai with her autos weeping klaiō , he was deeply moved embrimaomai in his heautou · ho spirit pneuma and kai greatly distressed tarassō .
MOUNCE	John	11	34	· kai He asked legō , “ Where pou have you laid tithēmi him autos ? ” They replied legō , “ Lord kyrios , come erchomai and kai see ide. ”
MOUNCE	John	11	35	Jesus Iēsous burst into tears dakryō . · ho
MOUNCE	John	11	36	So oun the ho Jews Ioudaios kept saying legō , “ See ide how pōs he loved phileō him autos ! ”
MOUNCE	John	11	37	But de some tis of ek them autos said legō , “ Was not ou this man houtos , who ho could open anoigō the ho eyes ophthalmos of the ho blind man typhlos , able dynamai to do poieō something so hina that · kai Lazarus houtos would not mē have died apothnēskō ? ”
MOUNCE	John	11	38	Then oun Jesus Iēsous , once more palin deeply moved embrimaomai , came erchomai to eis the ho tomb mnēmeion . It was eimi · de a cave spēlaion , and kai a stone lithos was lying epikeimai across epi it autos .
MOUNCE	John	11	39	Jesus Iēsous said legō , · ho “ Take airō away the ho stone lithos. ” Martha Martha , the ho sister adelphē of the ho dead man teleutaō , said legō to him autos , “ Lord kyrios , by ēdē now the body will smell ozō because gar it has been eimi buried for four tetartaios days . ”
MOUNCE	John	11	40	Jesus Iēsous said legō to her autos , · ho “ Did I not ou say legō to you sy that hoti if ean you would believe pisteuō you would see horaō the ho glory doxa of ho God theos ? ”
MOUNCE	John	11	41	So oun they took airō away the ho stone lithos . · ho Then de Jesus Iēsous lifted airō up anō his ho eyes ophthalmos and kai said legō , “ Father patēr , I thank eucharisteō you sy that hoti you have heard akouō me egō .
MOUNCE	John	11	42	I egō · de know oida that hoti you akouō always pantote hear akouō me egō , but alla I said legō this for dia the sake of the ho crowd ochlos · ho standing periistēmi here , that hina they may believe pisteuō that hoti you sy sent apostellō me egō. ”
MOUNCE	John	11	43	· kai When he had said legō this houtos , he called out kraugazō in a loud megas voice phōnē , “ Lazarus Lazaros , come deuro out exō !
MOUNCE	John	11	44	The ho dead man thnēskō came exerchomai out , his ho feet pous and kai his ho hands cheir bound deō with strips keiria of cloth , and kai · ho his autos face opsis wrapped perideō in a cloth soudarion . Jesus Iēsous said legō to them autos , · ho “ Unwrap lyō him autos , and kai let aphiēmi him autos go hypagō. ”
MOUNCE	John	11	45	Therefore oun many polys of ek the ho Jews Ioudaios who ho had come erchomai with pros · ho Mary Mariam and kai seen theaomai what hos he had done poieō , believed pisteuō in eis him autos .
MOUNCE	John	11	46	Some tis of ek them autos , however de , went aperchomai to pros the ho Pharisees Pharisaios and kai told legō them autos what hos Jesus Iēsous had done poieō .
MOUNCE	John	11	47	So oun the ho chief archiereus priests and kai the ho Pharisees Pharisaios gathered synagō the Council synedrion together synagō and kai said legō , “ What tis are we going to do poieō ? For hoti this houtos · ho man anthrōpos is performing poieō many polys signs sēmeion .
MOUNCE	John	11	48	If ean we let aphiēmi him autos go on like houtōs this , everyone pas will believe pisteuō in eis him autos , and kai the ho Romans Rhōmaios will come erchomai and kai destroy airō both kai our hēmeis · ho holy place topos and kai · ho our nation ethnos. ”
MOUNCE	John	11	49	But de one heis of ek them autos , Caiaphas Kaiaphas , who was eimi high archiereus priest · ho that ekeinos year eniautos , said legō to them autos , “ You hymeis know oida nothing ou at all oudeis .
MOUNCE	John	11	50	Or oude do you not realize logizomai that hoti it is to your hymeis advantage sympherō that hina one heis man anthrōpos should die apothnēskō for hyper the ho people laos and kai that the ho whole holos nation ethnos should not mē perish apollymi ? ”
MOUNCE	John	11	51	He did legō not ou say legō this houtos · de on apo his heautou own , but alla being eimi high archiereus priest · ho that ekeinos year eniautos he was prophesying prophēteuō that hoti Jesus Iēsous was about mellō to die apothnēskō for hyper the ho nation ethnos ,
MOUNCE	John	11	52	and kai not ou only monon for hyper the ho nation ethnos , but alla that hina · kai he should gather synagō into eis one heis the ho children teknon of ho God theos who ho were scattered diaskorpizō abroad .
MOUNCE	John	11	53	So oun from apo that ekeinos · ho day hēmera on they planned bouleuō to hina put him autos to death apokteinō .
MOUNCE	John	11	54	· ho Jesus Iēsous therefore oun no ouketi longer walked about peripateō openly parrēsia among en the ho Jews Ioudaios , but alla went aperchomai from there ekeithen to eis the ho region chōra near engys the ho wilderness erēmos , to eis a town polis called legō Ephraim Ephraim , and he stayed menō there kakei with meta his ho disciples mathētēs .
MOUNCE	John	11	55	Now de the ho Passover pascha of the ho Jews Ioudaios was eimi near engys , and kai many polys went up anabainō to eis Jerusalem Hierosolyma from ek the ho country chōra prior pro to the ho Passover pascha to hina purify hagnizō themselves heautou .
MOUNCE	John	11	56	They were looking zēteō for · ho Jesus Iēsous and kai were talking legō with meta one allēlōn another as they were standing histēmi in en the ho temple hieron , “ What tis do you hymeis think dokeō ? Surely he will not ou come erchomai to eis the ho festival heortē , will he ? ”
MOUNCE	John	11	57	Now de the ho chief archiereus priests and kai the ho Pharisees Pharisaios had given didōmi orders entolē that hina if ean anyone tis knew ginōskō where pou Jesus was eimi he should let them know mēnyō , so hopōs they might arrest piazō him autos .

MOUNCE	John	12	12	The ho next epaurion day the ho large polys crowd ochlos that ho had come erchomai to eis the ho festival heortē , on hearing akouō that hoti Jesus Iēsous was coming erchomai · ho to eis Jerusalem Hierosolyma ,
MOUNCE	John	12	2	So oun they made poieō a dinner deipnon for him autos there ekei . · kai · ho Martha Martha was serving diakoneō , · ho and de Lazarus Lazaros was eimi one heis of ek those ho reclining anakeimai at the table with syn him autos .
MOUNCE	John	12	3	· ho Mary Mariam took lambanō more than a pint litra of expensive polytimos perfume myron made of pure pistikos nard nardos and anointed aleiphō the ho feet pous of ho Jesus Iēsous and kai dried ekmassō them with ho her autos hair thrix . The ho · de house oikia was filled plēroō with ek the ho fragrance osmē of the ho perfume myron .
MOUNCE	John	12	4	But de Judas Ioudas · ho Iscariot Iskariōtēs , one heis of ek · ho his autos disciples mathētēs ( the ho one who would mellō betray paradidōmi him autos ) said legō ,
MOUNCE	John	12	5	“ Why dia tis was not ou this houtos · ho perfume myron sold pipraskō for three triakosioi hundred denarii dēnarion and kai the money given didōmi to the poor ptōchos ? ”
MOUNCE	John	12	6	He said legō · de this houtos , not ou because hoti he autos was concerned melei about peri the ho poor ptōchos , but alla because hoti he was eimi a thief kleptēs , and kai as keeper of echō the ho money glōssokomon box , he used to help himself to bastazō what ho was put ballō into it .
MOUNCE	John	12	7	Jesus Iēsous therefore oun said legō , · ho “ Leave aphiēmi her autos alone . She had to keep tēreō this perfume autos for eis the ho day hēmera of ho my egō burial entaphiasmos .
MOUNCE	John	12	8	For gar you will echō always pantote have echō the ho poor ptōchos with meta you heautou , but de you will echō not ou always pantote have echō me egō. ”
MOUNCE	John	12	9	When a large polys crowd ochlos of ek the ho Jews Ioudaios learned ginōskō that hoti Jesus was eimi there ekei , · kai they came erchomai , not ou only monon on account dia of · ho Jesus Iēsous but alla also kai that hina they might see · ho Lazarus Lazaros whom hos he had raised egeirō from ek the dead nekros .
MOUNCE	John	12	10	So de the ho chief priests archiereus made plans bouleuō to hina put apokteinō Lazarus Lazaros to death apokteinō as kai well , · ho
MOUNCE	John	12	11	because hoti on account of dia him autos many polys of the ho Jews Ioudaios were going hypagō over to eis Jesus Iēsous and kai putting pisteuō their faith in him . · ho
MOUNCE	John	12	13	took lambanō · ho branches baion of ho palm phoinix trees and kai went exerchomai out to eis meet hypantēsis him autos . · kai They began to cry kraugazō out , “ Hosanna hōsanna ! Blessed eulogeō in en the name onoma of the Lord kyrios is the ho coming erchomai one , even kai the ho king basileus of ho Israel Israēl ! ”
MOUNCE	John	12	14	And de Jesus Iēsous found heuriskō · ho a young onarion donkey and sat kathizō on epi it autos ; as kathōs it is eimi written graphō ,
MOUNCE	John	12	15	“ Do not mē be afraid phobeomai , daughter thugatēr of Zion Siōn ; behold idou , · ho your sy king basileus is coming erchomai , seated kathēmai on epi a donkey ’ s onos colt pōlos ! ”
MOUNCE	John	12	16	His autos disciples mathētēs did ginōskō not ou understand ginōskō these houtos things · ho · ho at first prōton , but alla when hote Jesus Iēsous was glorified doxazō , then tote they remembered mimnēskomai that hoti these houtos things had been eimi written graphō about epi him autos , and kai that they had done poieō these houtos things to him autos .
MOUNCE	John	12	17	The ho crowd ochlos that ho had been eimi with meta him autos when hote he called phōneō · ho Lazarus Lazaros out ek of the ho tomb mnēmeion and kai raised egeirō him autos from ek the dead nekros continued to bear witness martyreō .
MOUNCE	John	12	18	For dia this houtos reason the ho crowd ochlos went to meet hypantaō him autos , that is , because hoti they heard akouō he autos had performed poieō this houtos · ho sign sēmeion .
MOUNCE	John	12	19	The ho Pharisees Pharisaios therefore oun said legō to pros one heautou another , “ You see theōreō , you are accomplishing ōpheleō nothing oudeis . Look ide , the ho world kosmos has gone aperchomai after opisō him autos ! ”
MOUNCE	John	12	20	Now de there were eimi some tis Greeks Hellēn among ek those ho who went anabainō up to hina worship proskyneō at en the ho festival heortē .
MOUNCE	John	12	21	So oun these houtos came proserchomai to Philip Philippos , who ho was from apo Bethsaida Bēthsaida in ho Galilee Galilaia , and kai asked erōtaō him autos , saying legō , “ Sir kyrios , we would like thelō to see · ho Jesus Iēsous. ”
MOUNCE	John	12	22	Philip Philippos went erchomai · ho and kai told legō · ho Andrew Andreas ; Andrew Andreas and kai Philip Philippos went erchomai and kai told legō · ho Jesus Iēsous .
MOUNCE	John	12	23	· ho And de Jesus Iēsous answered apokrinomai them autos , saying legō , “ The ho hour hōra has come erchomai for hina the ho Son hyios of ho Man anthrōpos to be glorified doxazō .
MOUNCE	John	12	24	I tell legō you hymeis the solemn truth amēn , unless ean mē a ho kernel kokkos of ho wheat sitos falls piptō into eis the ho ground gē and dies apothnēskō , it autos remains menō a single monos kernel ; but de if ean it dies apothnēskō it produces pherō a great polys harvest karpos .
MOUNCE	John	12	25	The ho one who loves phileō · ho his autos life psychē loses apollymi it autos , and kai the ho one who hates miseō · ho his autos life psychē in en · ho this houtos world kosmos preserves phylassō it autos for eis eternal aiōnios life zōē .
MOUNCE	John	12	26	If ean anyone tis would serve diakoneō me egō , he must follow akoloutheō me egō ; and kai where hopou I egō am eimi , my emos servant diakonos will be eimi there ekei also kai . · ho · ho If ean anyone tis would serve diakoneō me egō , the ho Father patēr will honor timaō him autos .
MOUNCE	John	12	27	“ Now nyn is · ho my egō heart psychē deeply troubled tarassō . And kai what tis am I to say legō ? ‘ Father patēr , deliver sōzō me egō from ek · ho this houtos hour hōra ’ ? But alla for dia this houtos very purpose I have come erchomai to eis · ho this houtos hour hōra !
MOUNCE	John	12	28	Father patēr , glorify doxazō your sy · ho name onoma. ” Then oun a voice phōnē came erchomai from ek · ho heaven ouranos : · kai “ I have glorified doxazō it , and kai I will glorify doxazō it again palin. ”
MOUNCE	John	12	29	The ho crowd ochlos that ho was standing histēmi there and kai had heard akouō the voice said legō that it was ginomai thunder brontē ; others allos said legō , “ An angel angelos has spoken laleō to him autos. ”
MOUNCE	John	12	30	Jesus Iēsous answered apokrinomai , · kai saying legō , “ This houtos voice phōnē was ginomai not ou for dia my egō benefit , · ho but alla for dia yours hymeis .
MOUNCE	John	12	31	“ Now nyn is eimi the judgment krisis of ho this houtos world kosmos ; now nyn will the ho ruler archōn of ho this houtos world kosmos be driven ekballō out exō .
MOUNCE	John	12	32	And kagō I , when ean I am lifted hypsoō up from ek the ho earth gē , will draw all pas people to pros myself emautou. ”
MOUNCE	John	12	33	He said legō this houtos · de to signify sēmainō the kind poios of death thanatos he was going mellō to die apothnēskō .
MOUNCE	John	12	34	The ho crowd ochlos responded apokrinomai , “ We hēmeis have heard akouō from ek the ho law nomos that hoti the ho Christ Christos is to remain menō for eis all ho time aiōn ; so kai how pōs is it that you sy are saying legō that hoti the ho Son hyios of ho Man anthrōpos must dei be lifted hypsoō up ? Who tis is eimi this houtos · ho Son hyios of ho Man anthrōpos ? ”
MOUNCE	John	12	35	Then oun Jesus Iēsous said legō to them autos , · ho “ The ho light phōs will be eimi with en you hymeis for yet eti a little mikros while chronos . Keep walking peripateō while hōs you have echō the ho light phōs , so hina that the darkness skotia will katalambanō not mē overtake katalambanō you hymeis . · kai The ho one who walks peripateō in en the ho darkness skotia does not ou know oida where pou he is going hypagō .
MOUNCE	John	12	36	While hōs you have echō the ho light phōs , believe pisteuō in eis the ho light phōs , so hina that you may become ginomai sons hyios of light phōs. ” When Jesus Iēsous said laleō these houtos things , · kai he went aperchomai away and hid kryptō himself from apo them autos .
MOUNCE	John	12	37	Though poieō he autos had done poieō such tosoutos great · de signs sēmeion in their autos presence emprosthen , they continued in their unbelief ou toward eis him autos ,
MOUNCE	John	12	38	that hina the ho word logos spoken legō by the ho prophet prophētēs Isaiah ēsaias might be fulfilled plēroō : “ Lord kyrios , who tis has believed pisteuō what ho they heard akoē from us hēmeis , and kai to whom tis has the ho arm brachiōn of the Lord kyrios been revealed apokalyptō ? ”
MOUNCE	John	12	39	The reason why dia they could dynamai not ou believe pisteuō was that hoti in another palin place Isaiah ēsaias said legō ,
MOUNCE	John	12	40	“ He has blinded typhloō their autos · ho eyes ophthalmos and kai hardened pōroō their autos · ho heart kardia , lest hina mē they should see with their ho eyes ophthalmos , and kai perceive noeō with their ho heart kardia , and kai turn strephō , and kai I would heal iaomai them autos. ”
MOUNCE	John	12	41	Isaiah ēsaias said legō these houtos things because hoti he saw · ho Christ ’ s autos glory doxa and kai spoke laleō of peri him autos .
MOUNCE	John	12	42	Nevertheless homōs mentoi , many polys even kai of ek the ho authorities archōn believed pisteuō in eis him autos , but alla for fear dia of the ho Pharisees Pharisaios they would not ou confess homologeō it openly , lest hina mē they be ginomai expelled from the synagogue aposynagōgos .
MOUNCE	John	12	43	For gar they loved agapaō the ho praise doxa of ho men anthrōpos more mallon than ēper the ho praise doxa of ho God theos .
MOUNCE	John	12	44	Then de Jesus Iēsous cried krazō out , · kai saying legō , “ The ho one who believes pisteuō in eis me egō believes pisteuō not ou only in eis me egō but alla in eis the ho one who sent pempō me egō .
MOUNCE	John	12	45	And kai the ho one who sees theōreō me egō sees theōreō the ho one who sent pempō me egō .

MOUNCE	John	12	47	· kai If ean anyone tis hears akouō my egō · ho words rhēma and kai does not mē keep phylassō them , I egō am not ou the one who will judge krinō him autos ; for gar I did not ou come erchomai to hina judge krinō the ho world kosmos but alla to hina save sōzō the ho world kosmos .
MOUNCE	John	12	48	The ho one who rejects atheteō me egō and kai does not mē receive lambanō · ho my egō sayings rhēma has echō a ho judge krinō ; the ho word logos that hos I have spoken laleō will judge krinō him autos at en the ho last eschatos day hēmera .

MOUNCE	Romans	3	19	Now de we know oida that hoti whatever hosos the ho law nomos says legō , it speaks laleō to those ho who are under en the ho law nomos , so hina that every pas mouth stoma may be silenced phrassō and kai the ho whole pas world kosmos may be ginomai held accountable hypodikos to ho God theos .
MOUNCE	Romans	3	20	So dioti by ek the works ergon of the law nomos no ou flesh sarx at all pas will be justified dikaioō before enōpion him autos , because gar through dia the law nomos comes the knowledge epignōsis of sin hamartia .
MOUNCE	Romans	3	21	But de now nyni , apart chōris from the law nomos ( although attested martyreō by hypo the ho law nomos and kai the ho prophets prophētēs ) the righteousness dikaiosynē of God theos has been disclosed phaneroō .
MOUNCE	Romans	3	22	It is the righteousness dikaiosynē · de of God theos available through dia faith pistis in Jesus Iēsous Christ Christos for eis all pas who ho believe pisteuō . ( For gar there is eimi no ou distinction diastolē ,

MOUNCE	Romans	3	24	They are justified dikaioō freely dōrean by ho his autos grace charis through dia the ho redemption apolytrōsis that ho is in en Christ Christos Jesus Iēsous ,

MOUNCE	Romans	3	28	For gar we hold logizomai that a person anthrōpos is justified dikaioō by faith pistis apart chōris from the works ergon of the law nomos .

MOUNCE	Romans	4	4	Now de to the ho one who works ergazomai , his ho wages misthos are not ou credited logizomai as kata a gift charis , but alla as kata an obligation opheilēma .
MOUNCE	Romans	4	2	For gar if ei Abraham Abraam was justified dikaioō by ek works ergon , he has echō something to boast kauchēma about ( but alla not ou before pros God theos ) .
MOUNCE	Romans	4	3	For gar what tis does the ho scripture graphē say legō ? “ And de Abraham Abraam believed pisteuō · ho God theos , and kai it was credited logizomai to him autos as eis righteousness dikaiosynē. ”
MOUNCE	Romans	4	5	But de to the ho one who does not mē work ergazomai , but de entrusts pisteuō himself to epi the ho one who justifies dikaioō the ho ungodly asebēs , his autos faith pistis is credited logizomai · ho as eis righteousness dikaiosynē .
MOUNCE	Romans	4	6	So kathaper also kai David Dauid speaks legō of the ho blessedness makarismos of the ho one anthrōpos to whom hos · ho God theos credits logizomai righteousness dikaiosynē apart chōris from works ergon :
MOUNCE	Romans	4	7	“ Blessed makarios are those whose hos lawless deeds anomia are forgiven aphiēmi , · ho and kai whose hos sins hamartia are covered epikalyptō . · ho
MOUNCE	Romans	4	8	Blessed makarios is the man anēr whose hos sin hamartia the Lord kyrios will not ou mē take logizomai into account . ”
MOUNCE	Romans	4	9	· ho Therefore oun , is this houtos blessedness makarismos for epi the ho circumcised peritomē alone , or ē is it also kai for epi the ho uncircumcised akrobystia ? For gar we say legō , “ It was to ho Abraham Abraam that ho faith pistis was credited logizomai as eis righteousness dikaiosynē. ”
MOUNCE	Romans	4	10	How pōs then oun was it credited logizomai to him ? Was it after en he was eimi circumcised peritomē or ē before en akrobystia ? It was not ou after en his circumcision peritomē but alla before en akrobystia .
MOUNCE	Romans	4	11	· kai He received lambanō the sign sēmeion of circumcision peritomē as a seal sphragis of the ho righteousness dikaiosynē that he had by ho faith pistis · ho while he was still en · ho uncircumcised akrobystia , so eis that he autos would be eimi the father patēr of all pas who ho believe pisteuō but have never been circumcised dia , that eis they too kai might have righteousness dikaiosynē credited logizomai to them autos . · ho

MOUNCE	Romans	4	13	For gar the ho promise epangelia that he autos would be eimi heir klēronomos of kosmos the world kosmos did not ou come to ho Abraham Abraam or ē to ho his autos descendants sperma through dia the law nomos , · ho but alla through dia the righteousness dikaiosynē of faith pistis .
MOUNCE	Romans	4	14	For gar if ei the ho heirs klēronomos are those who follow ek the law nomos , then faith pistis is meaningless kenoō · ho and kai the ho promise epangelia is void katargeō .
MOUNCE	Romans	4	15	For gar the ho Law nomos brings about katergazomai wrath orgē , but de where hou there is eimi no ou law nomos , there can be no oude violation parabasis .
MOUNCE	Romans	4	16	For dia this houtos reason the ho promise epangelia is based ek on faith pistis , that hina it may depend kata on grace charis and so eis that it may be eimi made certain bebaios to all pas his ho descendants sperma , not ou only monon to those ho who are under ek the ho law nomos , but alla also kai to those ho who share ek the faith pistis of Abraham Abraam , who hos is eimi the father patēr of us hēmeis all pas .

MOUNCE	Romans	4	19	· kai Not mē being weak astheneō in ho faith pistis , he considered katanoeō · ho his heautou own body sōma as dead nekroō ( since he was hyparchō about pou a hundred hekatontaetēs years old ) , and kai the ho barrenness nekrōsis of ho Sarah ’ s Sarra womb mētra .

MOUNCE	Romans	5	7	For gar rarely molis will apothnēskō one tis die apothnēskō for hyper an upright dikaios person — though gar perhaps tacha for hyper · ho a genuinely good agathos person one tis · kai might actually dare tolmaō to die apothnēskō .
MOUNCE	Romans	5	8	But de God theos demonstrates synistēmi · ho his heautou love agapē for eis us hēmeis · ho in that hoti while eimi we hēmeis were eimi still eti sinners hamartōlos Christ Christos died apothnēskō for hyper us hēmeis .
MOUNCE	Romans	5	9	Since oun we have now nyn been justified dikaioō by en · ho his autos blood haima , much polys more mallon will we be saved sōzō from apo the ho wrath orgē of God through dia him autos .

MOUNCE	Romans	5	12	Therefore dia houtos , just hōsper as sin hamartia came eiserchomai into eis the ho world kosmos through dia one heis man anthrōpos , · ho and kai death thanatos through dia · ho sin hamartia , · ho and kai so houtōs death thanatos spread dierchomai to eis all pas men anthrōpos , · ho because epi hos all pas have sinned hamartanō— .
MOUNCE	Romans	5	13	For gar sin hamartia was eimi in en the world kosmos before achri the law nomos was given , but de sin hamartia is not ou charged ellogeō when there is eimi no mē law nomos .
MOUNCE	Romans	5	14	Nevertheless alla death thanatos reigned basileuō · ho from apo Adam Adam until mechri Moses Mōysēs , even kai over epi those ho whose sinning hamartanō was not mē like epi ho · ho the ho transgression parabasis of Adam Adam , who hos was eimi a type typos of the ho coming mellō one .

MOUNCE	Romans	6	7	for gar the ho one who has died apothnēskō has been set dikaioō free from apo · ho sin hamartia .

MOUNCE	Romans	6	10	For gar the death hos he died apothnēskō , he died apothnēskō to ho sin hamartia once ephapax for all ; but de the life hos he lives zaō , he lives zaō to ho God theos .
MOUNCE	Romans	6	11	So houtōs you hymeis too kai consider logizomai yourselves heautou to be eimi dead nekros to ho sin hamartia but de alive zaō to ho God theos in en Christ Christos Jesus Iēsous .

MOUNCE	Romans	7	7	What tis then oun shall we say legō ? Is the ho law nomos sin hamartia ? By no means mē ! On the contrary alla , I would ginōskō not ou have known ginōskō · ho sin hamartia except ei mē through dia the law nomos ; · ho that gar is , I would oida not ou have known oida what it means to covet epithumia had not ei mē the ho law nomos said legō , “ You shall not ou covet epithumeō. ”
MOUNCE	Romans	7	2	Thus gar a ho married hypandros woman gynē is bound deō by law nomos to ho her husband anēr while he is living zaō ; but de if ean her ho husband anēr dies apothnēskō , she is released katargeō from apo the ho law nomos of ho marriage anēr .

MOUNCE	Romans	7	4	So then hōste , my egō brothers adelphos , you hymeis also kai have died thanatoō to the ho law nomos through dia the ho body sōma of ho Christ Christos that eis you hymeis might belong ginomai to another heteros , to the ho one who was raised egeirō from ek the dead nekros , so hina that we might bear karpophoreō fruit for ho God theos .
MOUNCE	Romans	7	5	For gar while hote we were eimi living in en the ho flesh sarx , our ho sinful hamartia passions pathēma , · ho · ho aroused energeō by dia the ho law nomos , were at work in en · ho our hēmeis bodies melos to eis bear karpophoreō fruit for ho death thanatos .

MOUNCE	Romans	7	14	For gar we know oida that hoti the ho law nomos is eimi spiritual pneumatikos ; but de I egō am eimi unspiritual sarkinos , sold pipraskō as a slave to hypo · ho sin hamartia .

MOUNCE	Romans	8	8	Those ho · de controlled eimi by en the flesh sarx are dynamai not ou able dynamai to please areskō God theos .

MOUNCE	Romans	8	3	For gar what ho the ho law nomos could not do adynatos , weak astheneō as it was through dia the ho flesh sarx , · ho God theos , by sending pempō · ho his heautou own Son hyios in en the likeness homoiōma of sinful hamartia flesh sarx and kai as peri a sin hamartia offering , condemned katakrinō · ho sin hamartia in en the ho flesh sarx ,
MOUNCE	Romans	8	4	so hina that the ho righteous dikaiōma requirement of the ho law nomos might be fulfilled plēroō in en us hēmeis , who ho do peripateō not mē walk peripateō according kata to the flesh sarx but alla according kata to the Spirit pneuma .
MOUNCE	Romans	8	5	For gar those ho who live eimi according kata to the flesh sarx have set their minds phroneō on the ho things of the ho flesh sarx , but de those ho who live according kata to the Spirit pneuma have set their minds on the ho things of the ho Spirit pneuma .
MOUNCE	Romans	8	6	To set the ho mind phronēma on the ho flesh sarx leads to death thanatos , but to set the ho · de mind phronēma on the ho Spirit pneuma brings life zōē and kai peace eirēnē ,

MOUNCE	Romans	8	12	So ara then oun , brethren adelphos , we are eimi debtors opheiletēs , not ou to the ho flesh sarx , to live zaō according kata to the flesh sarx ,

MOUNCE	Romans	8	14	For gar it is those hosos who are led agō by the Spirit pneuma of God theos who houtos are eimi the sons hyios of God theos .
MOUNCE	Romans	8	15	For gar you did not ou receive lambanō the spirit pneuma of slavery douleia leading back palin to eis fear phobos , but alla you received lambanō the Spirit pneuma of adoption hyiothesia . By en him hos we cry out krazō , “ Abba abba ! · ho Father patēr ! ”
MOUNCE	Romans	8	16	The ho Spirit pneuma himself autos bears symmartyreō witness with · ho our hēmeis spirit pneuma that hoti we are eimi children teknon of God theos ,

MOUNCE	Romans	8	18	For gar I consider logizomai that hoti the ho sufferings pathēma of this ho present nyn time kairos are not ou worth axios comparing with pros the ho glory doxa that will mellō be revealed apokalyptō to eis us hēmeis .

MOUNCE	Romans	10	12	For gar there is eimi no ou distinction diastolē between te the Jew Ioudaios and kai the Greek Hellēn ; for gar the ho same autos Lord kyrios is Lord of all pas , giving generously plouteō to eis all pas who ho call epikaleō on him autos ;
MOUNCE	Romans	10	13	for gar “ everyone pas who hos calls epikaleō on the ho name onoma of the Lord kyrios will be saved sōzō. ”
MOUNCE	Romans	10	14	But oun how pōs are they to call epikaleō on one in eis whom hos they have not ou believed pisteuō ? And de how pōs are they to believe pisteuō in one of whom hos they have never ou heard akouō ? And de how pōs are they to hear akouō unless chōris someone proclaims kēryssō the message ?

MOUNCE	Romans	11	11	So oun I ask legō , did they stumble ptaiō so hina as to fall piptō ? By no means mē ! But alla because of ho their autos transgression paraptōma · ho salvation sōtēria has come to the ho Gentiles ethnos so eis as to make Israel autos jealous parazēloō .
MOUNCE	Romans	11	2	God theos has not ou repudiated apōtheō · ho · ho his autos people laos whom hos he foreknew proginōskō .

MOUNCE	Romans	11	5	So houtōs too kai at en the ho present nyn time kairos there is ginomai a remnant leimma , chosen eklogē by kata grace charis .
MOUNCE	Romans	11	6	And de if ei it is by grace charis , it is no ouketi longer on ek the basis of works ergon , otherwise epei · ho grace charis would no ouketi longer be ginomai grace charis .
MOUNCE	Romans	11	7	What tis then oun ? Israel Israēl failed ou to obtain epitynchanō what hos it was seeking epizēteō , but de the ho elect eklogē obtained epitynchanō it . The ho · de rest loipos were hardened pōroō ,
MOUNCE	Romans	11	8	as kathōs it is written graphō , “ God theos gave didōmi them autos · ho a spirit pneuma of stupor katanyxis , eyes ophthalmos that ho would not mē see blepō and kai ears ous that ho would not mē hear akouō , to heōs this ho very sēmeron day hēmera. ”
MOUNCE	Romans	11	9	And kai David Dauid says legō , “ May their autos table trapeza become ginomai · ho a snare pagis and kai a trap thēra , · kai a stumbling skandalon block and kai a retribution antapodoma for them autos .

MOUNCE	Romans	11	12	Now de if ei · ho their autos transgression paraptōma means riches ploutos for the world kosmos and kai · ho their autos failure hēttēma means riches ploutos for the Gentiles ethnos , how posos much more mallon will · ho their autos full plērōma inclusion mean !

MOUNCE	Romans	11	16	If ei · de the ho dough offered as first aparchē fruits is holy hagios , so also kai is the ho whole phyrama lump ; and kai if ei the ho root rhiza is holy hagios , so also kai are the ho branches klados .

MOUNCE	Romans	11	19	Then oun you will say legō , “ The branches klados were broken ekklaō off so hina I egō could be grafted enkentrizō in . ”
MOUNCE	Romans	11	20	That is true kalōs . They were broken off ekklaō because of ho unbelief apistia , and de you sy stand histēmi by ho faith pistis . Do phroneō not mē be phroneō proud hypsēlos , but alla stand in awe phobeomai .
MOUNCE	Romans	11	21	For gar if ei · ho God theos did pheidomai not ou spare pheidomai the ho natural kata physis branches klados , perhaps mē pōs he will pheidomai not oude spare pheidomai you sy either .

MOUNCE	1%20Corinthians	15	50	Now de this houtos I declare phēmi , brothers adelphos , that hoti flesh sarx and kai blood haima can not ou inherit klēronomeō the kingdom basileia of God theos , nor oude does klēronomeō the ho perishable phthora inherit klēronomeō the ho imperishable aphtharsia .

MOUNCE	1%20Corinthians	15	56	The ho · de sting kentron of ho death thanatos is · ho sin hamartia , and de the ho power dynamis of ho sin hamartia is the ho law nomos .

MOUNCE	Galatians	2	12	For gar until pro certain men tis came erchomai from apo James Iakōbos , he used to eat synesthiō with meta the ho Gentiles ethnos ; but de when hote they arrived erchomai , he began to draw back hypostellō and kai separate aphorizō himself heautou because he feared phobeomai those ho of ek the circumcision peritomē party .
MOUNCE	Galatians	2	13	And kai the ho rest loipos of the Jews Ioudaios joined synypokrinomai him autos in playing the hypocrite , · kai so that hōste even kai Barnabas Barnabas was led astray synapagō by ho their autos hypocrisy hypokrisis .
MOUNCE	Galatians	2	14	But alla when hote I saw that hoti they were not ou behaving in a manner consistent orthopodeō with pros the ho truth alētheia of the ho gospel euangelion , I said legō to ho Cephas Kēphas before emprosthen them all pas , “ If ei you sy , born hyparchō a Jew Ioudaios , live zaō like a Gentile ethnikōs and kai not ouchi like a Jew Ioudaikōs , by what right pōs are you trying to make anankazō the ho Gentiles ethnos live like Jews ? ”
MOUNCE	Galatians	2	15	We hēmeis ourselves are Jews Ioudaios by birth physis and kai not ou Gentile ethnos sinners hamartōlos ;
MOUNCE	Galatians	2	16	yet de we know oida that hoti no ou one anthrōpos is justified dikaioō by ek the works ergon of the law nomos but ean mē through dia faith pistis in Jesus Iēsous Christ Christos . And kai we hēmeis have come to believe pisteuō in eis Christ Christos Jesus Iēsous , so that hina we might be justified dikaioō by ek faith pistis in Christ Christos , and kai not ou by doing ek the works ergon of the law nomos , since hoti no ou one pas will be justified dikaioō by ek the works ergon of the law nomos .
MOUNCE	Galatians	2	17	But de if ei , while seeking zēteō to be justified dikaioō in en Christ Christos , we ourselves autos have also kai been found heuriskō to be sinners hamartōlos , is Christ Christos then ara a servant diakonos of sin hamartia ? Of course not mē !
MOUNCE	Galatians	2	18	But gar if ei I build up oikodomeō again palin those houtos things hos I once tore down katalyō , then I demonstrate synistēmi that I emautou am a lawbreaker parabatēs .
MOUNCE	Galatians	2	19	For gar through dia the law nomos I egō died apothnēskō to the law nomos so that hina I might live zaō for God theos . I have been crucified systauroō with Christ Christos ;

MOUNCE	Galatians	2	21	I do not ou nullify atheteō the ho grace charis of ho God theos ; for gar if ei righteousness dikaiosynē could be gained through dia the law nomos , then ara Christ Christos died apothnēskō for nothing dōrean !

MOUNCE	Galatians	3	3	Are you eimi so houtōs foolish anoētos ? Having begun enarchomai by the Spirit pneuma , would you epiteleō now nyn attain your goal epiteleō by the flesh sarx ?
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	2	Only monon this houtos I want thelō to learn manthanō from apo you hymeis : Did you receive lambanō the ho Spirit pneuma by ek works ergon of the law nomos or ē by ek hearing akoē with faith pistis ?
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	4	Have you suffered paschō so many things tosoutos for no purpose eikē ? — if ei it really kai was for no purpose eikē .
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	5	So oun does the ho one who gives epichorēgeō you hymeis the ho Spirit pneuma and kai works energeō miracles dynamis among en you hymeis do it by ek works ergon of the law nomos , or ē by ek hearing akoē with faith pistis ?
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	6	Consider kathōs Abraham Abraam : “ He believed pisteuō · ho God theos , and kai it was reckoned logizomai to him autos as eis righteousness dikaiosynē. ”
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	7	Know ginōskō then ara that hoti it is those ho of ek faith pistis who houtos are eimi the sons hyios of Abraham Abraam .
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	8	And de the ho Scripture graphē , foreseeing prooraō that hoti God theos would justify dikaioō the ho Gentiles ethnos by ek faith pistis , · ho preached proeuangelizomai the gospel beforehand to ho Abraham Abraam , saying hoti , “ In en you sy will all pas nations ethnos be blessed eneulogeō. ” · ho
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	9	So hōste then , those ho who ek believe pistis are blessed eulogeō along with syn Abraham Abraam , the ho believer pistos .
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	10	For gar all hosos who rely eimi on ek works ergon of the law nomos are eimi under hypo a curse katara ; for gar it is written graphō , “ Cursed epikataratos is everyone pas who hos does not ou continue emmenō in all pas things ho written graphō in en the ho book biblion of the ho law nomos , to do poieō them autos. ”
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	11	Now de it is clear dēlos that hoti no one oudeis is justified dikaioō before para God theos by en the law nomos , · ho because hoti “ it is by ek faith pistis that the ho righteous dikaios person will live zaō. ”
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	12	However de , the ho law nomos is eimi not ou of ek faith pistis ; on the contrary alla , it teaches that “ the ho one who does poieō them autos will live zaō by en them autos. ”
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	13	Christ Christos redeemed exagorazō us hēmeis from ek the ho curse katara of the ho law nomos by becoming ginomai a curse katara for hyper us hēmeis— for hoti it is written graphō , “ Cursed epikataratos is everyone pas who ho is hung kremannymi on epi a tree xylon ” —
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	14	in order that hina in en Christ Christos Jesus Iēsous the ho blessing eulogia of ho Abraham Abraam might come ginomai to eis the ho Gentiles ethnos , so that hina we might receive lambanō the ho promise epangelia of the ho Spirit pneuma through dia · ho faith pistis .
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	15	To speak legō in kata human terms anthrōpos , brothers adelphos : even though homōs a covenant diathēkē is one made by man anthrōpos , yet when it has been ratified kyroō , no one oudeis can set it aside atheteō or ē add epidiatassomai anything to it .
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	16	Now de the ho promises epangelia were made legō to ho Abraham Abraam and kai to ho his autos descendant sperma . Scripture does not ou say legō , “ and kai to ho descendants sperma , ” referring hōs to epi many polys , but alla “ and kai to ho your sy descendant sperma , ” referring hōs to epi one heis , who hos is eimi Christ Christos .
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	17	What I am saying legō is this houtos : · de the ho law nomos , which came ginomai four hundred tetrakosioi and kai thirty triakonta years etos later meta , does not ou annul akyroō a covenant diathēkē previously established prokyroō by hypo · ho God theos , so as eis to make katargeō the ho promise epangelia void .
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	18	For gar if ei the ho inheritance klēronomia is based on ek law nomos , it is no longer ouketi based on ek a promise epangelia ; but de God theos gave charizomai it to ho Abraham Abraam through dia a promise epangelia . · ho
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	19	Why tis then oun was the ho law nomos given ? It was added prostithēmi because of charin · ho transgressions parabasis , until achri hos the ho descendant sperma should come erchomai to whom hos the promise had been made epangellomai . It was established diatassō through dia angels angelos by en a mediator cheir mesitēs .
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	20	Now de a ho mediator mesitēs is eimi not ou for one heis party only , · ho but de God theos is eimi one heis .
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	21	Is the ho law nomos , therefore oun , opposed to kata the ho promises epangelia of ho God theos ? Certainly not mē ! For gar if ei a law nomos had been given didōmi that ho could dynamai impart life zōiopoieō , then righteousness dikaiosynē would an indeed ontōs be eimi by ek the law nomos . · ho
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	22	But alla the ho Scripture graphē confined synkleiō · ho everything pas under hypo sin hamartia , so that hina what ho was promised epangelia through ek faith pistis in Jesus Iēsous Christ Christos might be given didōmi to those ho who believe pisteuō .
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	23	Now de before pro faith pistis came erchomai , · ho we were held in custody phroureō under hypo the law nomos , imprisoned synkleiō until eis the ho coming mellō faith pistis would be revealed apokalyptō .
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	24	Thus hōste the ho law nomos was ginomai our hēmeis disciplinarian paidagōgos until eis the time of Christ Christos , so that hina we might be declared righteous dikaioō by ek faith pistis .
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	25	But de now that faith pistis has come erchomai , · ho we are eimi no longer ouketi under hypo a guardian paidagōgos .
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	26	For gar you are eimi all pas sons hyios of God theos through dia · ho faith pistis in en Christ Christos Jesus Iēsous .
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	27	For gar as many hosos of you baptizō as were baptized baptizō into eis Christ Christos have clothed yourselves with endyō Christ Christos .
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	28	Now there is neither ou Jew Ioudaios nor oude Greek Hellēn , neither ou slave nor oude free eleutheros , neither ou male arsēn nor kai female thēlys ; for gar you hymeis are eimi all pas one heis in en Christ Christos Jesus Iēsous .
MOUNCE	Galatians	3	29	And de if ei you hymeis belong to Christ Christos , then ara you are eimi descendants sperma of ho Abraham Abraam , heirs klēronomos according kata to the promise epangelia . The Mounce Reverse Interlinear™ New Testament ( MOUNCE ) Copyright ©

MOUNCE	Galatians	4	4	But de when hote the ho fullness plērōma of ho time chronos had come erchomai , God theos sent forth exapostellō · ho · ho his autos Son hyios , born ginomai of ek a woman gynē , born ginomai under hypo law nomos ,
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	2	However alla , he remains eimi under hypo the care of guardians epitropē and kai managers oikonomos until achri the ho time determined prothesmia by his ho father patēr .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	3	And kai so it is houtōs with us hēmeis . While hote we were eimi minors nēpios , we were eimi enslaved douloō to hypo the ho elementary stoicheion principles of the ho world kosmos .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	5	to hina redeem exagorazō those ho who were under hypo law nomos , so that hina we might receive apolambanō · ho adoption as sons hyiothesia .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	6	And de because hoti you are eimi sons hyios , God theos sent exapostellō · ho the ho Spirit pneuma of ho his autos Son hyios into eis · ho our hēmeis hearts kardia , who cries krazō out “ Abba abba ! · ho Father patēr ! ”
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	7	So hōste you are eimi no longer ouketi a slave , but alla a son hyios ; and de since ei you are a son hyios , then kai you are an heir klēronomos through dia God theos .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	8	Formerly alla tote , when you did not ou know oida God theos , you were enslaved douleuō to those ho who eimi by nature physis are eimi not mē gods theos .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	9	But de now nyn that you have come to know ginōskō God theos— or de rather mallon , are known ginōskō by hypo God theos— how pōs can you turn back epistrephō again palin to epi the ho feeble asthenēs and kai inferior ptōchos elementary principles stoicheion of the world ? How can you want thelō to be douleuō their hos slaves douleuō all over anōthen again palin ?
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	10	You scrupulously observe paratēreō special days hēmera and kai months mēn and kai seasons kairos and kai years eniautos !
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	11	I am afraid phobeomai that pōs I may have labored kopiaō over eis you hymeis to no avail eikē .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	12	Become ginomai as hōs I egō am , because hoti I kagō have become as hōs you hymeis are ; I plead deomai with you hymeis , brothers adelphos . You have done adikeō me egō no oudeis wrong adikeō .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	13	You know oida · de that hoti it was due to dia a physical sarx infirmity astheneia · ho that I preached the gospel euangelizō to you hymeis at ho first proteros ;
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	14	and kai though my egō condition sarx was a ho trial peirasmos to you hymeis , · ho you did not ou despise exoutheneō or oude reject ekptyō me , but alla you welcomed dechomai me egō as hōs an angel angelos of God theos , as hōs though I were Christ Christos Jesus Iēsous .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	15	What pou then oun became of the ho blessing makarismos you hymeis enjoyed ? For gar I testify martyreō about you hymeis that hoti , if ei possible dynatos , you would have torn out exoryssō · ho your hymeis eyes ophthalmos and given didōmi them to me egō !
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	16	So then hōste , have I become ginomai your hymeis enemy echthros by telling you hymeis the truth alētheuō ?
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	17	They zealously seek zēloō your hymeis favor , but for no ou good kalōs purpose . Rather alla , they want thelō to separate ekkleiō you hymeis from us so that hina you will seek zēloō them autos .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	18	Now de to be zealous zēloō for en a good purpose kalos is always pantote good kalos , · kai not mē just monon when en I egō am present pareimi with pros you hymeis .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	19	My egō little children teknon , for whom hos I am again palin in the pain of childbirth ōdinō until mechri Christ Christos is formed morphoō in en you hymeis ,
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	20	I wish thelō · de I could be pareimi with pros you hymeis now arti and kai change allassō · ho my egō tone phōnē , for hoti I am perplexed aporeō about en you hymeis .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	21	Tell legō me egō , you who ho want thelō to be eimi under hypo the law nomos , will you akouō not ou listen to akouō the ho law nomos ?
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	22	For gar it is written graphō that hoti Abraham Abraam had echō two dyo sons hyios , one heis by ek the ho slave woman paidiskē and kai one heis by ek the ho free woman eleutheros .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	23	The ho son by ek the ho slave paidiskē woman was born gennaō according kata to the flesh sarx , but de the ho son by ek the ho free woman eleutheros was born as the result of dia promise epangelia .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	24	This hostis may be eimi interpreted allegorically allēgoreō , for gar these houtos women represent eimi two dyo covenants diathēkē . One heis is from apo Mount oros Sinai Sina , bearing children gennaō to be eis slaves douleia ; she hostis is eimi Hagar Hagar .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	25	· ho Now de Hagar Hagar represents eimi Mount oros Sinai Sina in en · ho Arabia Arabia and de corresponds to systoicheō the ho present nyn Jerusalem Ierousalēm , for gar she is in slavery douleuō with meta · ho her autos children teknon .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	26	But de the ho Jerusalem Ierousalēm above anō is eimi the free eleutheros woman , and she hostis is eimi our hēmeis mother mētēr .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	27	For gar it is written graphō , “ Rejoice euphrainō , O barren woman steira , you who ho bear no ou children tiktō ; break forth rhēgnymi and kai cry aloud boaō , you who ho are not ou in the pain of childbirth ōdinō ! For hoti the ho children teknon of the ho desolate erēmos will be more mallon in number polys than ē those ho of the woman who has echō a ho husband anēr .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	28	But de you hymeis , my brothers adelphos , like kata Isaac Isaak , are eimi children teknon of promise epangelia .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	29	But alla just as hōsper at that time tote the ho one who was born gennaō according to kata the flesh sarx persecuted diōkō the ho one who was born according to kata the Spirit pneuma , so houtōs also kai it is now nyn .
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	30	But alla what tis does the ho Scripture graphē say legō ? “ Drive away ekballō the ho slave woman paidiskē and kai · ho her autos son hyios , for gar the ho son hyios of the ho slave woman paidiskē must not ou share the inheritance klēronomeō with meta the ho son hyios of the ho free woman eleutheros. ”
MOUNCE	Galatians	4	31	So then dio , brothers adelphos , we are eimi not ou children teknon of a slave woman paidiskē but alla of the ho free woman eleutheros . The Mounce Reverse Interlinear™ New Testament ( MOUNCE ) Copyright ©

MOUNCE	Galatians	5	5	For gar we hēmeis by the Spirit pneuma , through ek faith pistis , eagerly await apekdechomai the righteousness dikaiosynē for which we hope elpis .
MOUNCE	Galatians	5	2	Listen ide ! I egō , Paul Paulos , tell legō you hymeis that hoti if ean you agree to circumcision peritemnō , Christ Christos will be of ōpheleō no oudeis benefit to ōpheleō you hymeis .
MOUNCE	Galatians	5	3	And de furthermore palin I declare martyromai to every pas man anthrōpos who agrees to circumcision peritemnō that hoti he is eimi obligated opheiletēs to obey poieō the ho entire holos law nomos .
MOUNCE	Galatians	5	4	You have cut yourself katargeō off from apo Christ Christos , you dikaioō who hostis are trying to be justified dikaioō by en the law nomos ; you have fallen away ekpiptō from ho grace charis .
MOUNCE	Galatians	5	6	For gar in en Christ Christos Jesus Iēsous neither oute circumcision peritomē nor oute uncircumcision akrobystia counts for ischuō anything tis , but alla only faith pistis expressing itself energeō through dia love agapē .
MOUNCE	Galatians	5	7	You were running trechō well kalōs ; who tis hindered enkoptō you hymeis from mē obeying peithō the ho truth alētheia ?
MOUNCE	Galatians	5	8	Such ho persuasion peismonē does not ou come from ek the ho one who calls kaleō you hymeis .
MOUNCE	Galatians	5	9	A little mikros leaven zymē leavens zymoō the ho whole holos lump of dough phyrama !
MOUNCE	Galatians	5	10	I egō am confident peithō about eis you hymeis in en the Lord kyrios that hoti you will phroneō not oudeis think phroneō otherwise allos . But de the ho one who is trying to confuse tarassō you hymeis will pay bastazō the ho penalty krima , whoever hostis ean he may be eimi .
MOUNCE	Galatians	5	11	But de I egō , brothers adelphos , if ei I am kēryssō still eti preaching kēryssō circumcision peritomē , why tis am I still eti being persecuted diōkō ? In that case ara the ho offense skandalon of the ho cross stauros has been removed katargeō .
MOUNCE	Galatians	5	12	I wish ophelon · kai those ho who are disturbing anastatoō you hymeis would mutilate apokoptō themselves !
MOUNCE	Galatians	5	13	For gar you hymeis , brothers adelphos , were called kaleō to epi freedom eleutheria . Only monon do not mē use your ho freedom eleutheria as eis an opportunity aphormē for the ho flesh sarx , but alla through dia · ho love agapē serve douleuō one another allēlōn .
MOUNCE	Galatians	5	14	For gar the ho entire pas law nomos is summed up plēroō in en a single heis command logos : “ You shall love agapaō · ho your sy neighbor plēsion as hōs yourself seautou. ”
MOUNCE	Galatians	5	15	But de if ei you keep on biting daknō and kai devouring katesthiō one another allēlōn , watch out blepō that you are analoō not mē consumed analoō by hypo one another allēlōn .
MOUNCE	Galatians	5	16	So de I say legō , live peripateō by the Spirit pneuma and kai you will teleō not ou gratify teleō the desires epithumia of the flesh sarx .
MOUNCE	Galatians	5	17	For gar the ho desires epithumeō of the flesh sarx are against kata the ho Spirit pneuma , and de the desires of the ho Spirit pneuma are against kata the ho flesh sarx ; for gar these houtos are opposed antikeimai to one allēlōn another , to hina keep you poieō from mē doing poieō the things houtos you want thelō to do .

MOUNCE	Hebrews	8	4	So oun if ei he had been eimi on epi earth gē , he would an not oude be eimi a priest hiereus , since there are eimi already those ho who offer prospherō the ho gifts dōron prescribed by kata the law nomos .
MOUNCE	Hebrews	8	5	The place where they hostis serve latreuō is a shadowy skia suggestion hypodeigma · kai of the ho heavenly epouranios sanctuary , just as kathōs Moses Mōysēs was warned chrēmatizō by God when he was about mellō to erect epiteleō the ho tabernacle skēnē ; for gar he said phēmi , “ See horaō that you make poieō everything pas according to kata the ho pattern typos · ho shown deiknymi you sy on en the ho mountain oros. ”

MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	9	This hostis is an illustration parabolē pointing to eis the ho present enistēmi time kairos , · ho during kata which hos the gifts dōron and kai sacrifices thusia being offered prospherō can not mē dynamai perfect teleioō the ho worshiper latreuō so far as kata his conscience syneidēsis is concerned ,
MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	2	For gar a tent skēnē was set up kataskeuazō . The ho outer room prōtos , in en which hos were the ho lampstand lychnia and kai the ho table trapeza and kai the ho consecrated prothesis · ho bread artos , was called legō “ the Holy hagios Place . ”
MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	3	Behind meta · de the ho curtain katapetasma was a second deuteros room , a shrine skēnē · ho called legō “ the Most Holy Place hagios. ”
MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	4	It contained echō the golden chrysous altar thumiatērion of incense and kai the ho ark kibōtos of the ho covenant diathēkē covered perikalyptō on all sides pantothen with gold chrysion , in en which hos were the golden chrysous urn stamnos containing echō the ho manna manna , · kai · ho Aaron ’ s Aarōn rod rhabdos that ho had budded blastanō , and kai the ho stone tablets plax of the ho covenant diathēkē .

MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	6	When kataskeuazō these things houtos · de had been prepared kataskeuazō in this way houtōs , the ho priests hiereus used to enter eiseimi regularly dia into eis the ho outer prōtos room skēnē to perform epiteleō their ho ritual services latreia ;
MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	7	however de into eis the ho second deuteros room · ho only monos the ho high priest archiereus entered , and that only once hapax a year eniautos , and not ou without chōris taking blood haima , which hos he offered prospherō for hyper himself heautou and kai for the ho sins committed unintentionally agnoēma by the ho people laos .
MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	8	By this houtos the ho Holy hagios Spirit pneuma is showing dēloō · ho that the ho way hodos into the ho real sanctuary hagios had not yet mēpō been disclosed phaneroō as long as eti the ho first prōtos tent skēnē was echō standing stasis .
MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	10	but deal only monon with epi food brōma and kai drink poma and kai various diaphoros ceremonial washings baptismos , regulations dikaiōma for the body sarx imposed epikeimai until mechri the time kairos of correction diorthōsis .
MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	11	But de when Christ Christos appeared paraginomai as high priest archiereus of the ho good things agathos that have now come ginomai , passing through dia the ho greater megas and kai more perfect teleios tent skēnē ( not ou made with hands cheiropoiētos , that houtos is eimi , not ou of ho this houtos creation ktisis ) ,
MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	12	he entered eiserchomai once for all ephapax into eis the ho Most Holy Place hagios , not oude by means of dia the blood haima of goats tragos and kai calves moschos , but de by means of dia · ho his own idios blood haima , thus obtaining heuriskō an eternal aiōnios redemption lytrōsis .
MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	13	For gar if ei the ho blood haima of goats tragos and kai bulls tauros , and kai the sprinkled rhantizō ashes spodos of a heifer damalis , sanctify hagiazō those ho who have been ceremonially defiled koinoō so that pros · ho their ho flesh sarx is purified katharotēs ,
MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	14	how much posos more mallon will the ho blood haima of ho Christ Christos , who hos through dia the eternal aiōnios Spirit pneuma offered prospherō himself heautou without blemish to ho God theos , purify katharizō · ho our hēmeis conscience syneidēsis from apo dead nekros works ergon to eis worship latreuō the living zaō God theos !
MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	15	And kai for dia this reason houtos he is eimi the mediator mesitēs of a new kainos covenant diathēkē , so that hopōs those ho who are called kaleō may receive lambanō the ho promised epangelia eternal aiōnios inheritance klēronomia , since a death thanatos has occurred ginomai that eis redeems apolytrōsis them from the ho transgressions parabasis committed under epi that ho first prōtos covenant diathēkē . · ho
MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	16	For gar where hopou there is a covenant diathēkē , it is required anankē that the death thanatos of the ho one who made diatithēmi it be established pherō .
MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	17	For gar a will diathēkē takes effect bebaios only when epi a person has died nekros ; it can not possibly epei be valid ischuō so long as hote the ho one who made diatithēmi it is still alive zaō .
MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	18	Therefore hothen not even oude the ho first prōtos covenant was inaugurated enkainizō without chōris blood haima .

MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	21	And de in the same way homoiōs he sprinkled rhantizō with ho blood haima both kai the ho tent skēnē and kai all pas the ho vessels skeuos · ho used in worship leitourgia .

MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	23	Thus oun it was necessary anankē that · ho earthly copies hypodeigma of the ho · ho heavenly ouranos realities be purified katharizō by these houtos rites , but de the ho heavenly realities epouranios themselves autos with better kreittōn sacrifices thusia than para these houtos .
MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	24	For gar Christ Christos did eiserchomai not ou enter eiserchomai a sanctuary hagios made with hands cheiropoiētos , that was a mere copy antitypos of the ho true one alēthinos , but alla into eis heaven ouranos itself autos , · ho now nyn to appear emphanizō in the ho presence prosōpon of ho God theos on hyper our hēmeis behalf .

MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	27	And kai just kata as hosos it is appointed apokeimai for ho mortals anthrōpos to die apothnēskō once hapax , and de after meta that houtos to experience judgment krisis ,
MOUNCE	Hebrews	9	28	so houtōs also kai · ho Christ Christos , after having been offered prospherō once hapax to eis bear anapherō the sins hamartia of many polys , will appear horaō a second time ek to those ho who are eagerly awaiting apekdechomai him autos , without chōris reference to sin hamartia but for eis salvation sōtēria .

MOUNCE	Hebrews	10	10	By en that hos will thelēma we have been eimi made holy hagiazō through dia the ho offering prosphora of the ho body sōma of Jesus Iēsous Christ Christos once for all ephapax .
MOUNCE	Hebrews	10	2	For epei otherwise would an they not ou have ceased pauō being offered prospherō , since dia the ho worshipers latreuō , once hapax cleansed katharizō , would have echō no mēdeis consciousness syneidēsis of sins hamartia ?
MOUNCE	Hebrews	10	3	But alla in en these autos sacrifices there is a reminder anamnēsis of sins hamartia year after kata year eniautos .
MOUNCE	Hebrews	10	4	For gar it is impossible adynatos for the blood haima of bulls tauros and kai goats tragos to take away aphaireō sins hamartia .
MOUNCE	Hebrews	10	5	Therefore dio when he came eiserchomai into eis the ho world kosmos , he said legō , “ Sacrifice thusia and kai offering prosphora you did not ou desire thelō , but de a body sōma you prepared katartizō for me egō .

MOUNCE	Hebrews	10	8	After he said legō what I just quoted , “ Sacrifices thusia and kai offerings prosphora and kai whole burnt offerings holokautōma and kai sin-offerings peri hamartia you did not ou desire thelō nor oude did you take pleasure in eudokeō them ” ( namely those hostis offered prospherō according to kata the law nomos ) ,
MOUNCE	Hebrews	10	9	then tote he added legō , “ Behold idou , I have come hēkō to do poieō · ho your sy will thelēma. ” He does away with anaireō the ho first prōtos in order to hina establish histēmi the ho second deuteros .

MOUNCE	Hebrews	10	26	For gar if we hēmeis deliberately hekousiōs persist in sin hamartanō after meta receiving lambanō the ho knowledge epignōsis of the ho truth alētheia , there is apoleipō no longer ouketi any apoleipō sacrifice thusia for peri sins hamartia ,

MOUNCE	Hebrews	10	31	It is terrifying phoberos to fall empiptō into eis the hands cheir of the living zaō God theos .

MOUNCE	1%20John	4	1	John
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	4	Little children teknion , you hymeis have been born eimi of ek · ho God theos and kai have overcome nikaō them autos , because hoti the ho one who is in en you hymeis is eimi greater megas than ē the ho one who is in en the ho world kosmos .
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	2	This is how en you can recognize ginōskō the ho Spirit pneuma of ho God theos : every pas spirit pneuma that hos confesses homologeō that Jesus Iēsous Christ Christos has come erchomai in en the flesh sarx is eimi from ek · ho God theos ,
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	3	but kai every pas spirit pneuma that hos does not mē confess homologeō · ho Jesus Iēsous is eimi not ou from ek · ho God theos . · kai This houtos is eimi the ho spirit of the ho Antichrist antichristos , which hos you heard akouō was coming erchomai , and kai now nyn is eimi already ēdē in en the ho world kosmos .
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	5	They autos are eimi of ek the ho world kosmos ; therefore dia houtos they speak laleō from ek the ho world ’ s kosmos perspective and kai the ho world kosmos listens to akouō them autos .
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	6	We hēmeis are eimi from ek · ho God theos . The ho person who knows ginōskō · ho God theos listens akouō to us hēmeis , but whoever hos is eimi not ou from ek · ho God theos does not ou listen akouō to us hēmeis . By ek this houtos we know ginōskō the ho Spirit pneuma of ho truth alētheia and kai the ho spirit pneuma of ho error planē .
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	7	Dear friends agapētos , let us love agapaō one another allēlōn , because hoti · ho love agapē is eimi from ek · ho God theos , and kai everyone pas who ho loves agapaō has been born gennaō of ek · ho God theos and kai knows ginōskō · ho God theos .
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	8	The ho person who does not mē love agapaō does not ou know ginōskō · ho God theos , because hoti · ho God theos is eimi love agapē .
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	9	By en this houtos the ho love agapē of ho God theos is revealed phaneroō to en us hēmeis : that hoti God theos has sent apostellō · ho his autos one and only monogenēs Son hyios · ho · ho into eis the ho world kosmos so that hina we might live zaō through dia him autos .
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	10	In en this houtos is eimi · ho love agapē , not ou that hoti we hēmeis have loved agapaō · ho God theos but alla that hoti he autos loved agapaō us hēmeis and kai sent apostellō · ho his autos Son hyios as a propitiation hilasmos for peri · ho our hēmeis sins hamartia .
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	11	Dear friends agapētos , if ei God theos loved agapaō us hēmeis like that houtōs , · ho we hēmeis also kai ought opheilō to love agapaō one another allēlōn .
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	12	No one oudeis has ever pōpote seen theaomai God theos . If ean we love agapaō one another allēlōn , · ho God theos abides menō in en us hēmeis , and kai · ho his autos love agapē has eimi achieved its goal teleioō in en us hēmeis .
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	13	By en this houtos we know ginōskō that hoti we abide menō in en God autos and kai he autos in en us hēmeis : because hoti he has given didōmi us hēmeis of ek · ho his autos Spirit pneuma .
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	14	And kai we hēmeis have seen theaomai and kai testify martyreō that hoti the ho Father patēr has sent apostellō his ho Son hyios as the Savior sōtēr of the ho world kosmos .
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	15	If ean anyone hos confesses homologeō that hoti Jesus Iēsous is eimi the ho Son hyios of ho God theos , · ho God theos abides menō in en him autos and kai he autos in en · ho God theos .
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	16	And kai we hēmeis have come to know ginōskō and kai to trust pisteuō the ho love agapē that hos God theos has echō · ho for en us hēmeis . · ho God theos is eimi love agapē , and kai the ho one who abides menō in en · ho love agapē abides menō in en · ho God theos , and kai · ho God theos abides menō in en him autos .
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	17	By en this houtos , love agapē is fully realized teleioō · ho among meta us hēmeis , so that hina we may have echō confidence parrēsia in en the ho day hēmera of ho judgment krisis ; because hoti just as kathōs he ekeinos is eimi , so also kai are eimi we hēmeis in en · ho this houtos world kosmos .
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	18	There is eimi no ou fear phobos in en · ho love agapē , but alla · ho perfect teleios love agapē drives ballō out exō · ho fear phobos because hoti · ho fear phobos has to do with echō punishment kolasis . So de the ho one who fears phobeomai has not ou been perfected teleioō in en · ho love agapē .
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	19	We hēmeis love agapaō because hoti he autos first prōtos loved agapaō us hēmeis .
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	20	If ean someone tis says legō , “ I love agapaō · ho God theos , ” yet kai hates miseō · ho his autos brother adelphos , he is eimi a liar pseustēs ; for gar the ho one who does not mē love agapaō · ho his autos brother adelphos whom hos he has seen horaō , can not ou love agapaō · ho God theos whom hos he has not ou seen horaō .
MOUNCE	1%20John	4	21	And kai the ho commandment entolē we have echō from apo him autos is this houtos : the ho one who loves agapaō · ho God theos must also kai love agapaō · ho his autos brother adelphos . The Mounce Reverse Interlinear™ New Testament ( MOUNCE ) Copyright ©

And kai the ho Spirit pneuma is eimi the ho one who testifies martyreō , because hoti the ho Spirit pneuma is eimi the ho truth alētheia .

MOUNCE	1%20John	5	9	If ei we receive lambanō the ho testimony martyria of ho men anthrōpos , the ho testimony martyria of ho God theos is eimi greater megas , because hoti this houtos is eimi the ho testimony martyria of ho God theos that hoti he has borne martyreō concerning peri · ho his autos Son hyios .
MOUNCE	1%20John	5	10	The ho one who believes pisteuō in eis the ho Son hyios of ho God theos has echō the ho testimony martyria in en himself heautou ; the ho one who does not mē believe pisteuō · ho God theos has made poieō him autos out to be a liar pseustēs , because hoti he has not ou believed pisteuō in eis the ho testimony martyria that hos God theos has borne martyreō · ho concerning peri · ho his autos Son hyios .
