NIRV	Matthew	2	2	They asked , “ Where is the child who has been born to be king of the Jews ? We saw his star when it rose . Now we have come to worship him. ”
NIRV	Matthew	2	3	When King Herod heard about it , he was very upset . Everyone in Jerusalem was troubled too .
NIRV	Matthew	2	4	So Herod called together all the chief priests of the people . He also called the teachers of the law . He asked them where the Messiah was going to be born .
NIRV	Matthew	2	5	“ In Bethlehem in Judea , ” they replied . “ This is what the prophet has written . He said ,
NIRV	Matthew	2	6	“ ‘ But you , Bethlehem , in the land of Judah , are certainly not the least important among the towns of Judah . A ruler will come out of you . He will rule my people Israel like a shepherd. ’ ” ( Micah 5:2 )
NIRV	Matthew	2	7	Then Herod secretly called for the Wise Men . He found out from them exactly when the star had appeared .
NIRV	Matthew	2	8	He sent them to Bethlehem . He said , “ Go and search carefully for the child . As soon as you find him , report it to me . Then I can go and worship him too. ”
NIRV	Matthew	2	9	After the Wise Men had listened to the king , they went on their way . The star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them . It finally stopped over the place where the child was .
NIRV	Matthew	2	10	When they saw the star , they were filled with joy .
NIRV	Matthew	2	11	The Wise Men went to the house . There they saw the child with his mother Mary . They bowed down and worshiped him . Then they opened their treasures . They gave him gold , frankincense and myrrh .
NIRV	Matthew	2	12	But God warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod . So they returned to their country on a different road . Jesus ’ Family Escapes to Egypt
NIRV	Matthew	2	13	When the Wise Men had left , Joseph had a dream . In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph . “ Get up ! ” the angel said . “ Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt . Stay there until I tell you to come back . Herod is going to search for the child . He wants to kill him. ”
NIRV	Matthew	2	14	So Joseph got up . During the night , he left for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary .
NIRV	Matthew	2	15	They stayed there until King Herod died . So the words the Lord had spoken through the prophet came true . He had said , “ I brought my son out of Egypt. ” ( Hosea 11:1 )
NIRV	Matthew	2	16	Herod realized that the Wise Men had tricked him . So he became very angry . He gave orders about Bethlehem and the area around it . He ordered all the boys two years old and under to be killed . This agreed with the time when the Wise Men had seen the star .
NIRV	Matthew	2	17	In this way , the words Jeremiah the prophet spoke came true . He had said ,
NIRV	Matthew	2	18	“ A voice is heard in Ramah . It ’ s the sound of crying and deep sadness . Rachel is crying over her children . She refuses to be comforted , because they are gone. ” ( Jeremiah 31:15 ) Jesus ’ Family Returns to Nazareth
NIRV	Matthew	2	19	After Herod died , Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt . In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to him .
NIRV	Matthew	2	20	The angel said , “ Get up ! Take the child and his mother . Go to the land of Israel . The people who were trying to kill the child are dead. ”
NIRV	Matthew	2	21	So Joseph got up . He took the child and his mother Mary back to the land of Israel .
NIRV	Matthew	2	22	But then he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea . Archelaus was ruling in place of his father Herod . This made Joseph afraid to go there . Joseph had been warned in a dream . So he went back to the land of Galilee instead .
NIRV	Matthew	2	23	There he lived in a town called Nazareth . So what the prophets had said about Jesus came true . They had said that he would be called a Nazarene . Copyright ©

NIRV	Matthew	3	12	His pitchfork is in his hand to clear the straw from his threshing floor . He will gather his wheat into the storeroom . But he will burn up the husks with fire that can ’ t be put out. ” Jesus Is Baptized
NIRV	Matthew	3	13	Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River . He wanted to be baptized by John .
NIRV	Matthew	3	14	But John tried to stop him . So he told Jesus , “ I need to be baptized by you . So why do you come to me ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	3	15	Jesus replied , “ Let it be this way for now . It is right for us to do this . It carries out God ’ s holy plan. ” Then John agreed .
NIRV	Matthew	3	16	As soon as Jesus was baptized , he came up out of the water . At that moment heaven was opened . Jesus saw the Spirit of God coming down on him like a dove .
NIRV	Matthew	3	17	A voice from heaven said , “ This is my Son , and I love him . I am very pleased with him. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Matthew	4	19	“ Come and follow me , ” Jesus said . “ I will send you out to fish for people. ”
NIRV	Matthew	4	20	At once they left their nets and followed him .
NIRV	Matthew	4	21	Going on from there , he saw two other brothers . They were James , son of Zebedee , and his brother John . They were in a boat with their father Zebedee . As they were preparing their nets , Jesus called out to them .

NIRV	Matthew	5	13	“ You are the salt of the earth . But suppose the salt loses its saltiness . How can it be made salty again ? It is no longer good for anything . It will be thrown out . People will walk all over it .
NIRV	Matthew	5	14	“ You are the light of the world . A town built on a hill can ’ t be hidden .
NIRV	Matthew	5	15	Also , people do not light a lamp and put it under a bowl . Instead , they put it on its stand . Then it gives light to everyone in the house .

NIRV	Matthew	5	19	Do not ignore even one of the least important commands . And do not teach others to ignore them . If you do , you will be called the least important person in the kingdom of heaven . Instead , practice and teach these commands . Then you will be called important in the kingdom of heaven .

NIRV	Matthew	5	29	If your right eye causes you to sin , poke it out and throw it away . Your eye is only one part of your body . It is better to lose an eye than for your whole body to be thrown into hell .

NIRV	Matthew	5	34	But here is what I tell you . Do not make any promises like that at all . Do not make them in the name of heaven . That is God ’ s throne .
NIRV	Matthew	5	35	Do not make them in the name of the earth . That is the stool for God ’ s feet . Do not make them in the name of Jerusalem . That is the city of the Great King .
NIRV	Matthew	5	36	And do not make a promise in your own name . You can ’ t make even one hair of your head white or black .
NIRV	Matthew	5	37	All you need to say is simply ‘ Yes ’ or ‘ No. ’ Anything more than this comes from the evil one . Be Kind to Others

NIRV	Matthew	6	10	May your kingdom come . May what you want to happen be done on earth as it is done in heaven .
NIRV	Matthew	6	11	Give us today our daily bread .
NIRV	Matthew	6	12	And forgive us our sins , just as we also have forgiven those who sin against us .
NIRV	Matthew	6	13	Keep us from sinning when we are tempted . Save us from the evil one. ’
NIRV	Matthew	6	14	Forgive other people when they sin against you . If you do , your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you .

NIRV	Matthew	6	19	“ Do not gather for yourselves riches on earth . Moths and rats can destroy them . Thieves can break in and steal them .

NIRV	Matthew	6	24	“ No one can serve two masters at the same time . You will hate one of them and love the other . Or you will be faithful to one and dislike the other . You can ’ t serve God and money at the same time . Do Not Worry
NIRV	Matthew	6	25	“ I tell you , do not worry . Don ’ t worry about your life and what you will eat or drink . And don ’ t worry about your body and what you will wear . Isn ’ t there more to life than eating ? Aren ’ t there more important things for the body than clothes ?
NIRV	Matthew	6	26	Look at the birds of the air . They don ’ t plant or gather crops . They don ’ t put away crops in storerooms . But your Father who is in heaven feeds them . Aren ’ t you worth much more than they are ?
NIRV	Matthew	6	27	Can you add even one hour to your life by worrying ?
NIRV	Matthew	6	28	“ And why do you worry about clothes ? See how the wild flowers grow . They don ’ t work or make clothing .
NIRV	Matthew	6	29	But here is what I tell you . Not even Solomon in all his royal robes was dressed like one of these flowers .
NIRV	Matthew	6	30	If that is how God dresses the wild grass , won ’ t he dress you even better ? Your faith is so small ! After all , the grass is here only today . Tomorrow it is thrown into the fire .
NIRV	Matthew	6	31	So don ’ t worry . Don ’ t say , ‘ What will we eat ? ’ Or , ‘ What will we drink ? ’ Or , ‘ What will we wear ? ’
NIRV	Matthew	6	32	People who are ungodly run after all those things . Your Father who is in heaven knows that you need them .
NIRV	Matthew	6	33	But put God ’ s kingdom first . Do what he wants you to do . Then all those things will also be given to you .
NIRV	Matthew	6	34	So don ’ t worry about tomorrow . Tomorrow will worry about itself . Each day has enough trouble of its own . Copyright ©

NIRV	Matthew	7	13	“ Enter God ’ s kingdom through the narrow gate . The gate is large and the road is wide that leads to ruin . Many people go that way .
NIRV	Matthew	7	14	But the gate is small and the road is narrow that leads to life . Only a few people find it . True and False Prophets
NIRV	Matthew	7	15	“ Watch out for false prophets . They come to you pretending to be sheep . But on the inside they are hungry wolves .
NIRV	Matthew	7	16	You can tell each tree by its fruit . Do people pick grapes from bushes ? Do they pick figs from thorns ?
NIRV	Matthew	7	17	In the same way , every good tree bears good fruit . But a bad tree bears bad fruit .
NIRV	Matthew	7	18	A good tree can ’ t bear bad fruit . And a bad tree can ’ t bear good fruit .
NIRV	Matthew	7	19	Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down . It is thrown into the fire .
NIRV	Matthew	7	20	You can tell each tree by its fruit . True and False Disciples
NIRV	Matthew	7	21	“ Not everyone who says to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will enter the kingdom of heaven . Only those who do what my Father in heaven wants will enter .
NIRV	Matthew	7	22	Many will say to me on that day , ‘ Lord ! Lord ! Didn ’ t we prophesy in your name ? Didn ’ t we drive out demons in your name ? Didn ’ t we do many miracles in your name ? ’
NIRV	Matthew	7	23	Then I will tell them clearly , ‘ I never knew you . Get away from me , you who do evil ! ’ The Wise and Foolish Builders
NIRV	Matthew	7	24	“ So then , everyone who hears my words and puts them into practice is like a wise man . He builds his house on the rock .
NIRV	Matthew	7	25	The rain comes down . The water rises . The winds blow and beat against that house . But it does not fall . It is built on the rock .
NIRV	Matthew	7	26	But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man . He builds his house on sand .
NIRV	Matthew	7	27	The rain comes down . The water rises . The winds blow and beat against that house . And it falls with a loud crash. ”
NIRV	Matthew	7	28	Jesus finished saying all these things . The crowds were amazed at his teaching .
NIRV	Matthew	7	29	That ’ s because he taught like one who had authority . He did not speak like their teachers of the law . Copyright ©

NIRV	Matthew	8	8	The commander replied , “ Lord , I am not good enough to have you come into my house . But just say the word , and my servant will be healed .
NIRV	Matthew	8	2	A man who had a skin disease came and got down on his knees in front of Jesus . He said , “ Lord , if you are willing to make me ‘ clean , ’ you can do it. ”
NIRV	Matthew	8	3	Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man . “ I am willing to do it , ” he said . “ Be ‘ clean ’ ! ” Right away the man was healed of his skin disease .
NIRV	Matthew	8	4	Then Jesus said to him , “ Don ’ t tell anyone . Go and show yourself to the priest , and offer the gift Moses commanded . It will be a witness to everyone. ” A Roman Commander Has Faith
NIRV	Matthew	8	5	When Jesus entered Capernaum , a Roman commander came to him . He asked Jesus for help .
NIRV	Matthew	8	6	“ Lord , ” he said , “ my servant lies at home and can ’ t move . He is suffering terribly. ”
NIRV	Matthew	8	7	Jesus said , “ Shall I come and heal him ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	8	9	I myself am a man under authority . And I have soldiers who obey my orders . I tell this one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes . I tell that one , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes . I say to my slave , ‘ Do this , ’ and he does it. ”
NIRV	Matthew	8	10	When Jesus heard this , he was amazed . He said to those following him , “ What I ’ m about to tell you is true . In Israel I have not found anyone whose faith is so strong .
NIRV	Matthew	8	11	I say to you that many will come from the east and the west . They will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven . They will sit with Abraham , Isaac and Jacob .
NIRV	Matthew	8	12	But those who think they belong in the kingdom will be thrown outside , into the darkness . There they will weep and grind their teeth. ”
NIRV	Matthew	8	13	Then Jesus said to the Roman commander , “ Go ! It will be done just as you believed it would. ” And his servant was healed at that moment . Jesus Heals Many People
NIRV	Matthew	8	14	When Jesus came into Peter ’ s house , he saw Peter ’ s mother-in-law . She was lying in bed . She had a fever .
NIRV	Matthew	8	15	Jesus touched her hand , and the fever left her . She got up and began to serve him .
NIRV	Matthew	8	16	When evening came , many people controlled by demons were brought to Jesus . He drove out the spirits with a word . He healed all who were sick .
NIRV	Matthew	8	17	This happened so that what Isaiah the prophet had said would come true . He had said , “ He suffered the things we should have suffered . He took on himself the sicknesses that should have been ours. ” ( Isaiah 53:4 ) The Cost of Following Jesus
NIRV	Matthew	8	18	Jesus saw the crowd around him . So he gave his disciples orders to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee .
NIRV	Matthew	8	19	Then a teacher of the law came to him . He said , “ Teacher , I will follow you no matter where you go. ”
NIRV	Matthew	8	20	Jesus replied , “ Foxes have dens . Birds have nests . But the Son of Man has no place to lay his head. ”
NIRV	Matthew	8	21	Another follower said to him , “ Lord , first let me go and bury my father. ”
NIRV	Matthew	8	22	But Jesus told him , “ Follow me . Let the dead bury their own dead. ” Jesus Calms the Storm
NIRV	Matthew	8	23	Jesus got into a boat . His disciples followed him .
NIRV	Matthew	8	24	Suddenly a terrible storm came up on the lake . The waves crashed over the boat . But Jesus was sleeping .
NIRV	Matthew	8	25	The disciples went and woke him up . They said , “ Lord ! Save us ! We ’ re going to drown ! ”
NIRV	Matthew	8	26	He replied , “ Your faith is so small ! Why are you so afraid ? ” Then Jesus got up and ordered the winds and the waves to stop . It became completely calm .
NIRV	Matthew	8	27	The disciples were amazed . They asked , “ What kind of man is this ? Even the winds and the waves obey him ! ” Jesus Heals Two Men Controlled by Demons
NIRV	Matthew	8	28	Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake in the area of the Gadarenes . Two men controlled by demons met him . They came from the tombs . The men were so wild that no one could pass that way .
NIRV	Matthew	8	29	“ Son of God , what do you want with us ? ” they shouted . “ Have you come here to punish us before the time for us to be judged ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	8	30	Not very far away , a large herd of pigs was feeding .
NIRV	Matthew	8	31	The demons begged Jesus , “ If you drive us out , send us into the herd of pigs. ”
NIRV	Matthew	8	32	Jesus said to them , “ Go ! ” So the demons came out of the men and went into the pigs . The whole herd rushed down the steep bank . They ran into the lake and drowned in the water .
NIRV	Matthew	8	33	Those who were tending the pigs ran off . They went into the town and reported all this . They told the people what had happened to the men who had been controlled by demons .
NIRV	Matthew	8	34	Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus . When they saw him , they begged him to leave their area . Copyright ©

NIRV	Matthew	9	9	As Jesus went on from there , he saw a man named Matthew . He was sitting at the tax collector ’ s booth . “ Follow me , ” Jesus told him . Matthew got up and followed him .
NIRV	Matthew	9	2	Some men brought to him a man who could not walk . He was lying on a mat . Jesus saw that they had faith . So he said to the man , “ Don ’ t lose hope , son . Your sins are forgiven. ”
NIRV	Matthew	9	3	Then some teachers of the law said to themselves , “ This fellow is saying a very evil thing ! ”
NIRV	Matthew	9	4	Jesus knew what they were thinking . So he said , “ Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts ?
NIRV	Matthew	9	5	Is it easier to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven ’ ? Or to say , ‘ Get up and walk ’ ?
NIRV	Matthew	9	6	But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. ” So he spoke to the man who could not walk . “ Get up , ” he said . “ Take your mat and go home. ”
NIRV	Matthew	9	7	The man got up and went home .
NIRV	Matthew	9	8	When the crowd saw this , they were filled with wonder . They praised God for giving that kind of authority to a human being . Jesus Chooses Matthew and Eats With Sinners
NIRV	Matthew	9	10	Later Jesus was having dinner at Matthew ’ s house . Many tax collectors and sinners came . They ate with Jesus and his disciples .
NIRV	Matthew	9	11	The Pharisees saw this . So they asked the disciples , “ Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	9	12	years . She touched the edge of his clothes .
NIRV	Matthew	9	13	Go and learn what this means , ‘ I want mercy and not sacrifice. ’ ( Hosea 6:6 ) I have not come to get those who think they are right with God to follow me . I have come to get sinners to follow me. ” Jesus Is Asked About Fasting
NIRV	Matthew	9	14	One day John ’ s disciples came . They said to Jesus , “ We and the Pharisees often go without eating . Why don ’ t your disciples go without eating ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	9	15	Jesus answered , “ How can the guests of the groom be sad while he is with them ? The time will come when the groom will be taken away from them . Then they will fast .
NIRV	Matthew	9	16	“ People don ’ t sew a patch of new cloth on old clothes . The new piece will pull away from the old . That will make the tear worse .
NIRV	Matthew	9	17	People don ’ t pour new wine into old wineskins . If they do , the skins will burst . The wine will run out , and the wineskins will be destroyed . No , people pour new wine into new wineskins . Then both are saved. ” Jesus Heals a Dead Girl and a Suffering Woman
NIRV	Matthew	9	18	While Jesus was saying this , a synagogue leader came . He got down on his knees in front of Jesus . He said , “ My daughter has just died . But come and place your hand on her . Then she will live again. ”
NIRV	Matthew	9	19	Jesus got up and went with him . So did his disciples .
NIRV	Matthew	9	20	Just then a woman came up behind Jesus . She had a sickness that made her bleed . It had lasted for
NIRV	Matthew	9	21	She thought , “ I only need to touch his clothes . Then I will be healed. ”
NIRV	Matthew	9	22	Jesus turned and saw her . “ Dear woman , don ’ t give up hope , ” he said . “ Your faith has healed you. ” The woman was healed at that moment .
NIRV	Matthew	9	23	When Jesus entered the synagogue leader ’ s house , he saw the noisy crowd and people playing flutes .
NIRV	Matthew	9	24	He said , “ Go away . The girl is not dead . She is sleeping. ” But they laughed at him .
NIRV	Matthew	9	25	After the crowd had been sent outside , Jesus went in . He took the girl by the hand , and she got up .
NIRV	Matthew	9	26	News about what Jesus had done spread all over that area . Jesus Heals Two Blind Men
NIRV	Matthew	9	27	As Jesus went on from there , two blind men followed him . They called out , “ Have mercy on us , Son of David ! ”
NIRV	Matthew	9	28	When Jesus went indoors , the blind men came to him . He asked them , “ Do you believe that I can do this ? ” “ Yes , Lord , ” they replied .
NIRV	Matthew	9	29	Then he touched their eyes . He said , “ It will happen to you just as you believed. ”
NIRV	Matthew	9	30	They could now see again . Jesus strongly warned them , “ Be sure that no one knows about this. ”
NIRV	Matthew	9	31	But they went out and spread the news . They talked about him all over that area .
NIRV	Matthew	9	32	While they were going out , another man was brought to Jesus . A demon controlled him , and he could not speak .
NIRV	Matthew	9	33	When the demon was driven out , the man spoke . The crowd was amazed . They said , “ Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel. ”
NIRV	Matthew	9	34	But the Pharisees said , “ He drives out demons by the power of the prince of demons. ” There Are Only a Few Workers
NIRV	Matthew	9	35	Jesus went through all the towns and villages . He taught in their synagogues . He preached the good news of the kingdom . And he healed every illness and sickness .
NIRV	Matthew	9	36	When he saw the crowds , he felt deep concern for them . They were treated badly and were helpless , like sheep without a shepherd .
NIRV	Matthew	9	37	Then Jesus said to his disciples , “ The harvest is huge . But there are only a few workers .
NIRV	Matthew	9	38	So ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers out into his harvest field. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Matthew	10	12	As you enter the home , greet those who live there .
NIRV	Matthew	10	2	Here are the names of the
NIRV	Matthew	10	3	Next were Philip and Bartholomew , and also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector . Two more were James , son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus .
NIRV	Matthew	10	4	The last were Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot . Judas was the one who was later going to hand Jesus over to his enemies .
NIRV	Matthew	10	5	Jesus sent these

NIRV	Matthew	10	7	As you go , preach this message , ‘ The kingdom of heaven has come near. ’
NIRV	Matthew	10	8	Heal those who are sick . Bring those who are dead back to life . Make those who have skin diseases ‘ clean ’ again . Drive out demons . You have received freely , so give freely .
NIRV	Matthew	10	9	“ Do not get any gold , silver or copper to take with you in your belts .
NIRV	Matthew	10	11	When you enter a town or village , look for someone who is willing to welcome you . Stay at their house until you leave .
NIRV	Matthew	10	13	If that home welcomes you , give it your blessing of peace . If it does not , don ’ t bless it .
NIRV	Matthew	10	14	Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words . If they don ’ t , leave that home or town , and shake the dust off your feet .
NIRV	Matthew	10	15	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . On judgment day it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town .
NIRV	Matthew	10	16	“ I am sending you out like sheep among wolves . So be as wise as snakes and as harmless as doves .
NIRV	Matthew	10	17	Watch out ! You will be handed over to the local courts . You will be whipped in the synagogues .
NIRV	Matthew	10	18	You will be brought to governors and kings because of me . You will be witnesses to them and to the Gentiles .

NIRV	Matthew	10	23	When people attack you in one place , escape to another . What I ’ m about to tell you is true . You will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes .
NIRV	Matthew	10	24	“ The student is not better than the teacher . A slave is not better than his master .
NIRV	Matthew	10	25	It is enough for students to be like their teachers . And it is enough for slaves to be like their masters . If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul , what can the others who live there expect ?
NIRV	Matthew	10	26	“ So don ’ t be afraid of your enemies . Everything that is secret will be brought out into the open . Everything that is hidden will be uncovered .

NIRV	Matthew	11	11	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . No one more important than John the Baptist has ever been born . But the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is more important than he is .
NIRV	Matthew	11	12	Since the days of John the Baptist , the kingdom of heaven has been under attack . And violent people are taking hold of it .
NIRV	Matthew	11	2	John the Baptist was in prison . When he heard about the actions of the Messiah , he sent his disciples to him .
NIRV	Matthew	11	3	They asked Jesus , “ Are you the one who is supposed to come ? Or should we look for someone else ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	11	4	Jesus replied , “ Go back to John . Report to him what you hear and see .
NIRV	Matthew	11	5	Blind people receive sight . Disabled people walk . Those who have skin diseases are made ‘ clean. ’ Deaf people hear . Those who are dead are raised to life . And the good news is preached to those who are poor .
NIRV	Matthew	11	6	Blessed is anyone who does not give up their faith because of me. ”
NIRV	Matthew	11	7	As John ’ s disciples were leaving , Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John . He said , “ What did you go out into the desert to see ? Tall grass waving in the wind ?
NIRV	Matthew	11	8	If not , what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in fine clothes ? No . People who wear fine clothes are in kings ’ palaces .
NIRV	Matthew	11	9	Then what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
NIRV	Matthew	11	10	He is the one written about in Scripture . It says , “ ‘ I will send my messenger ahead of you . He will prepare your way for you. ’ ( Malachi 3:1 )
NIRV	Matthew	11	13	All the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John came .
NIRV	Matthew	11	14	If you are willing to accept it , John is the Elijah who was supposed to come .
NIRV	Matthew	11	15	Whoever has ears should listen .
NIRV	Matthew	11	16	“ What can I compare today ’ s people to ? They are like children sitting in the markets and calling out to others . They say ,
NIRV	Matthew	11	17	“ ‘ We played the flute for you . But you didn ’ t dance . We sang a funeral song . But you didn ’ t become sad. ’
NIRV	Matthew	11	18	When John came , he didn ’ t eat or drink as you do . And people say , ‘ He has a demon. ’
NIRV	Matthew	11	19	But when the Son of Man came , he ate and drank as you do . And people say , ‘ This fellow is always eating and drinking far too much . He ’ s a friend of tax collectors and “ sinners. ” ’ By wise actions wisdom is shown to be right. ” Towns That Do Not Turn Away From Sin
NIRV	Matthew	11	20	Jesus began to speak against the towns where he had done most of his miracles . The people there had not turned away from their sins . So he said ,
NIRV	Matthew	11	21	“ How terrible it will be for you , Chorazin ! How terrible for you , Bethsaida ! Suppose the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon . They would have turned away from their sins long ago . They would have put on clothes for mourning . They would have sat down in ashes .
NIRV	Matthew	11	22	But I tell you this . On judgment day it will be easier for Tyre and Sidon than for you .
NIRV	Matthew	11	23	And what about you , Capernaum ? Will you be lifted to the heavens ? No ! You will go down to the place of the dead . Suppose the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom . It would still be here today .
NIRV	Matthew	11	24	But I tell you this . On judgment day it will be easier for Sodom than for you. ” Rest for All Who Are Tired
NIRV	Matthew	11	25	At that time Jesus said , “ I praise you , Father . You are Lord of heaven and earth . You have hidden these things from wise and educated people . But you have shown them to little children .
NIRV	Matthew	11	26	Yes , Father . This is what you wanted to do .
NIRV	Matthew	11	27	“ My Father has given all things to me . The Father is the only one who knows the Son . And the only ones who know the Father are the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to make him known .

NIRV	Matthew	12	12	A person is worth more than sheep ! So the Law allows us to do good on the Sabbath day. ”
NIRV	Matthew	12	2	The Pharisees saw this . They said to Jesus , “ Look ! It is against the Law to do this on the Sabbath day . But your disciples are doing it anyway ! ”
NIRV	Matthew	12	3	Jesus answered , “ Haven ’ t you read about what David did ? He and his men were hungry .
NIRV	Matthew	12	4	So he entered the house of God . He and his men ate the holy bread . Only priests were allowed to eat it .
NIRV	Matthew	12	5	Haven ’ t you read the Law ? It tells how every Sabbath day the priests in the temple have to do their work on that day . But they are not considered guilty .
NIRV	Matthew	12	6	I tell you that something more important than the temple is here .
NIRV	Matthew	12	7	Scripture says , ‘ I want mercy and not sacrifice. ’ ( Hosea 6:6 ) You don ’ t know what those words mean . If you did , you would not bring charges against those who are not guilty .
NIRV	Matthew	12	8	The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day. ”
NIRV	Matthew	12	9	Going on from that place , Jesus went into their synagogue .
NIRV	Matthew	12	10	A man with a weak and twisted hand was there . The Pharisees were trying to accuse Jesus of a crime . So they asked him , “ Does the Law allow us to heal on the Sabbath day ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	12	11	He said to them , “ What if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath day ? Won ’ t you take hold of it and lift it out ?
NIRV	Matthew	12	13	Then Jesus said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand. ” So he stretched it out . It had been made as good as new . It was just as good as the other hand .
NIRV	Matthew	12	14	But the Pharisees went out and planned how to kill Jesus . God ’ s Chosen Servant
NIRV	Matthew	12	15	Jesus knew all about the Pharisees ’ plans . So he left that place . A large crowd followed him , and he healed all who were sick .
NIRV	Matthew	12	16	But he warned them not to tell other people about him .
NIRV	Matthew	12	17	This was to make what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah come true . It says ,
NIRV	Matthew	12	18	“ Here is my servant . I have chosen him . He is the one I love . I am very pleased with him . I will put my Spirit on him . He will announce to the nations that everything will be made right .
NIRV	Matthew	12	19	He will not argue or cry out . No one will hear his voice in the streets .
NIRV	Matthew	12	20	He will not break a bent twig . He will not put out a dimly burning flame . He will make right win over wrong .
NIRV	Matthew	12	21	The nations will put their hope in him. ” ( Isaiah 42:1–4 ) Jesus and Beelzebul
NIRV	Matthew	12	22	A man controlled by demons was brought to Jesus . The man was blind and could not speak . Jesus healed him . Then the man could speak and see .
NIRV	Matthew	12	23	All the people were amazed . They said , “ Could this be the Son of David ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	12	24	The Pharisees heard this . So they said , “ This fellow drives out demons by the power of Beelzebul , the prince of demons. ”
NIRV	Matthew	12	25	Jesus knew what they were thinking . So he said to them , “ Every kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed . Every city or family that is divided against itself will not stand .
NIRV	Matthew	12	26	If Satan drives out Satan , he fights against himself . Then how can his kingdom stand ?
NIRV	Matthew	12	27	You say I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebul . Then by whose power do your people drive them out ? So then , they will be your judges .
NIRV	Matthew	12	28	But suppose I drive out demons by the Spirit of God . Then the kingdom of God has come to you .
NIRV	Matthew	12	29	“ Or think about this . How can you enter a strong man ’ s house and just take what the man owns ? You must first tie him up . Then you can rob his house .
NIRV	Matthew	12	30	“ Anyone who is not with me is against me . Anyone who does not gather sheep with me scatters them .
NIRV	Matthew	12	31	So here is what I tell you . Every kind of sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven . But speaking evil things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
NIRV	Matthew	12	32	Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven . But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven . A person like that won ’ t be forgiven either now or in days to come .
NIRV	Matthew	12	33	“ If you make a tree good , its fruit will be good . If you make a tree bad , its fruit will be bad . You can tell a tree by its fruit .
NIRV	Matthew	12	34	You nest of poisonous snakes ! How can you who are evil say anything good ? Your mouths say everything that is in your hearts .
NIRV	Matthew	12	35	A good man says good things . These come from the good that is stored up inside him . An evil man says evil things . These come from the evil that is stored up inside him .
NIRV	Matthew	12	36	But here is what I tell you . On judgment day , everyone will have to account for every empty word they have spoken .
NIRV	Matthew	12	37	By your words you will be found guilty or not guilty. ” The Sign of Jonah
NIRV	Matthew	12	38	Some of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law came to Jesus . They said , “ Teacher , we want to see a sign from you. ”
NIRV	Matthew	12	39	He answered , “ Evil and unfaithful people ask for a sign ! But none will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah .
NIRV	Matthew	12	40	Jonah was in the belly of a huge fish for three days and three nights . Something like that will happen to the Son of Man . He will spend three days and three nights in the grave .
NIRV	Matthew	12	41	The men of Nineveh will stand up on judgment day with the people now living . And the Ninevites will prove that these people are guilty . The men of Nineveh turned away from their sins when Jonah preached to them . And now something more important than Jonah is here .
NIRV	Matthew	12	42	The Queen of the South will stand up on judgment day with the people now living . And she will prove that they are guilty . She came from very far away to listen to Solomon ’ s wisdom . And now something more important than Solomon is here .
NIRV	Matthew	12	43	“ What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a person ? It goes through dry areas looking for a place to rest . But it doesn ’ t find it .
NIRV	Matthew	12	44	Then it says , ‘ I will return to the house I left. ’ When it arrives there , it finds the house empty . The house has been swept clean and put in order .
NIRV	Matthew	12	45	Then the evil spirit goes and takes with it seven other spirits more evil than itself . They go in and live there . That person is worse off than before . That is how it will be with the evil people of today. ” Jesus ’ Mother and Brothers
NIRV	Matthew	12	46	While Jesus was still talking to the crowd , his mother and brothers stood outside . They wanted to speak to him .
NIRV	Matthew	12	47	Someone told him , “ Your mother and brothers are standing outside . They want to speak to you. ”
NIRV	Matthew	12	48	Jesus replied to him , “ Who is my mother ? And who are my brothers ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	12	49	Jesus pointed to his disciples . He said , “ Here is my mother ! Here are my brothers !
NIRV	Matthew	12	50	Anyone who does what my Father in heaven wants is my brother or sister or mother. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Matthew	13	13	Here is why I use stories when I speak to the people . I say , “ They look , but they don ’ t really see . They listen , but they don ’ t really hear or understand .
NIRV	Matthew	13	2	Large crowds gathered around him . So he got into a boat and sat down . All the people stood on the shore .
NIRV	Matthew	13	3	Then he told them many things using stories . He said , “ A farmer went out to plant his seed .
NIRV	Matthew	13	4	He scattered the seed on the ground . Some fell on a path . Birds came and ate it up .
NIRV	Matthew	13	5	Some seed fell on rocky places , where there wasn ’ t much soil . The plants came up quickly , because the soil wasn ’ t deep .
NIRV	Matthew	13	6	When the sun came up , it burned the plants . They dried up because they had no roots .
NIRV	Matthew	13	7	Other seed fell among thorns . The thorns grew up and crowded out the plants .
NIRV	Matthew	13	8	Still other seed fell on good soil . It produced a crop
NIRV	Matthew	13	100	,
NIRV	Matthew	13	60	pounds of flour . The yeast worked its way all through the dough. ”
NIRV	Matthew	13	30	Let both grow together until the harvest . At that time I will tell the workers what to do . Here is what I will say to them . First collect the weeds . Tie them in bundles to be burned . Then gather the wheat . Bring it into my storeroom. ’ ” The Stories of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast
NIRV	Matthew	13	9	Whoever has ears should listen. ”
NIRV	Matthew	13	10	The disciples came to him . They asked , “ Why do you use stories when you speak to the people ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	13	11	He replied , “ Because you have been given the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven . It has not been given to outsiders .
NIRV	Matthew	13	12	Everyone who has this kind of knowledge will be given more knowledge . In fact , they will have very much . If anyone doesn ’ t have this kind of knowledge , even what little they have will be taken away from them .
NIRV	Matthew	13	14	In them the words of the prophet Isaiah come true . He said , “ ‘ You will hear but never understand . You will see but never know what you are seeing .
NIRV	Matthew	13	15	The hearts of these people have become stubborn . They can barely hear with their ears . They have closed their eyes . Otherwise they might see with their eyes . They might hear with their ears . They might understand with their hearts . They might turn to the Lord , and then he would heal them. ’ ( Isaiah 6:9,10 )
NIRV	Matthew	13	16	But blessed are your eyes because they see . And blessed are your ears because they hear .
NIRV	Matthew	13	17	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . Many prophets and godly people wanted to see what you see . But they didn ’ t see it . They wanted to hear what you hear . But they didn ’ t hear it .
NIRV	Matthew	13	18	“ Listen ! Here is the meaning of the story of the farmer .
NIRV	Matthew	13	19	People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it . Then the evil one comes . He steals what was planted in their hearts . Those people are like the seed planted on a path .
NIRV	Matthew	13	20	The seed that fell on rocky places is like other people . They hear the message and at once receive it with joy .
NIRV	Matthew	13	21	But they have no roots . So they last only a short time . They quickly fall away from the faith when trouble or suffering comes because of the message .
NIRV	Matthew	13	22	The seed that fell among the thorns is like others who hear the message . But then the worries of this life and the false promises of wealth crowd it out . They keep the message from producing fruit .
NIRV	Matthew	13	23	But the seed that fell on good soil is like those who hear the message and understand it . They produce a crop
NIRV	Matthew	13	24	Jesus told the crowd another story . “ Here is what the kingdom of heaven is like , ” he said . “ A man planted good seed in his field .
NIRV	Matthew	13	25	But while everyone was sleeping , his enemy came . The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then went away .
NIRV	Matthew	13	26	The wheat began to grow and form grain . At the same time , weeds appeared .
NIRV	Matthew	13	27	“ The owner ’ s slaves came to him . They said , ‘ Sir , didn ’ t you plant good seed in your field ? Then where did the weeds come from ? ’
NIRV	Matthew	13	28	“ ‘ An enemy did this , ’ he replied . “ The slaves asked him , ‘ Do you want us to go and pull up the weeds ? ’
NIRV	Matthew	13	29	“ ‘ No , ’ the owner answered . ‘ While you are pulling up the weeds , you might pull up the wheat with them .
NIRV	Matthew	13	31	Jesus told the crowd another story . He said , “ The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed . Someone took the seed and planted it in a field .
NIRV	Matthew	13	32	It is the smallest of all seeds . But when it grows , it is the largest of all garden plants . It becomes a tree . Birds come and rest in its branches. ”
NIRV	Matthew	13	33	Jesus told them still another story . “ The kingdom of heaven is like yeast , ” he said . “ A woman mixed it into
NIRV	Matthew	13	34	Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd using stories . He did not say anything to them without telling a story .
NIRV	Matthew	13	35	So the words spoken by the prophet came true . He had said , “ I will open my mouth and tell stories . I will speak about things that were hidden since the world was made. ” ( Psalm 78:2 ) Jesus Explains the Story of the Weeds
NIRV	Matthew	13	36	Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house . His disciples came to him . They said , “ Explain to us the story of the weeds in the field. ”
NIRV	Matthew	13	37	He answered , “ The one who planted the good seed is the Son of Man .
NIRV	Matthew	13	38	The field is the world . The good seed stands for the people who belong to the kingdom . The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one .
NIRV	Matthew	13	39	The enemy who plants them is the devil . The harvest is judgment day . And the workers are angels .
NIRV	Matthew	13	40	“ The weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire . That is how it will be on judgment day .
NIRV	Matthew	13	41	The Son of Man will send out his angels . They will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin . They will also get rid of all who do evil .
NIRV	Matthew	13	42	They will throw them into the blazing furnace . There people will weep and grind their teeth .
NIRV	Matthew	13	43	Then God ’ s people will shine like the sun in their Father ’ s kingdom . Whoever has ears should listen . The Stories of the Hidden Treasure and the Pearl
NIRV	Matthew	13	44	“ The kingdom of heaven is like treasure that was hidden in a field . When a man found it , he hid it again . He was very happy . So he went and sold everything he had . And he bought that field .
NIRV	Matthew	13	45	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a trader who was looking for fine pearls .
NIRV	Matthew	13	46	He found one that was very valuable . So he went away and sold everything he had . And he bought that pearl . The Story of the Net
NIRV	Matthew	13	47	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a net . It was let down into the lake . It caught all kinds of fish .
NIRV	Matthew	13	48	When it was full , the fishermen pulled it up on the shore . Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets . But they threw the bad fish away .
NIRV	Matthew	13	49	This is how it will be on judgment day . The angels will come . They will separate the people who did what is wrong from those who did what is right .
NIRV	Matthew	13	50	They will throw the evil people into the blazing furnace . There the evil ones will weep and grind their teeth .
NIRV	Matthew	13	51	“ Do you understand all these things ? ” Jesus asked . “ Yes , ” they replied .
NIRV	Matthew	13	52	He said to them , “ Every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house . He brings new treasures out of his storeroom as well as old ones. ” A Prophet Without Honor
NIRV	Matthew	13	53	Jesus finished telling these stories . Then he moved on from there .
NIRV	Matthew	13	54	He came to his hometown of Nazareth . There he began teaching the people in their synagogue . They were amazed . “ Where did this man get this wisdom ? Where did he get this power to do miracles ? ” they asked .
NIRV	Matthew	13	55	“ Isn ’ t this the carpenter ’ s son ? Isn ’ t his mother ’ s name Mary ? Aren ’ t his brothers James , Joseph , Simon and Judas ?
NIRV	Matthew	13	56	Aren ’ t all his sisters with us ? Then where did this man get all these things ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	13	57	They were not pleased with him at all . But Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own town and in his own home. ”
NIRV	Matthew	13	58	He did only a few miracles in Nazareth because the people there had no faith . Copyright ©

NIRV	Matthew	14	14	When Jesus came ashore , he saw a large crowd . He felt deep concern for them . He healed their sick people .
NIRV	Matthew	14	2	He said to his attendants , “ This is John the Baptist . He has risen from the dead ! That is why he has the power to do miracles. ”
NIRV	Matthew	14	3	Herod had arrested John . He had tied him up and put him in prison because of Herodias . She was the wife of Herod ’ s brother Philip .
NIRV	Matthew	14	4	John had been saying to Herod , “ It is against the Law for you to have her as your wife. ”
NIRV	Matthew	14	5	Herod wanted to kill John . But he was afraid of the people , because they thought John was a prophet .
NIRV	Matthew	14	6	On Herod ’ s birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for Herod and his guests . She pleased Herod very much .
NIRV	Matthew	14	7	So he promised to give her anything she asked for .
NIRV	Matthew	14	8	Her mother told her what to say . So the girl said to Herod , “ Give me the head of John the Baptist on a big plate. ”
NIRV	Matthew	14	9	The king was very upset . But he thought of his promise and his dinner guests . So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for .
NIRV	Matthew	14	10	Herod had John ’ s head cut off in the prison .
NIRV	Matthew	14	11	His head was brought in on a big plate and given to the girl . She then carried it to her mother .
NIRV	Matthew	14	12	baskets of leftover pieces .
NIRV	Matthew	14	13	Jesus heard what had happened to John . He wanted to be alone . So he went in a boat to a quiet place . The crowds heard about this . They followed him on foot from the towns .
NIRV	Matthew	14	15	When it was almost evening , the disciples came to him . “ There is nothing here , ” they said . “ It ’ s already getting late . Send the crowds away . They can go and buy some food in the villages. ”
NIRV	Matthew	14	16	Jesus replied , “ They don ’ t need to go away . You give them something to eat. ”
NIRV	Matthew	14	17	“ We have only five loaves of bread and two fish , ” they answered .
NIRV	Matthew	14	18	“ Bring them here to me , ” he said .
NIRV	Matthew	14	19	Then Jesus directed the people to sit down on the grass . He took the five loaves and the two fish . He looked up to heaven and gave thanks . He broke the loaves into pieces . Then he gave them to the disciples . And the disciples gave them to the people .
NIRV	Matthew	14	20	All of them ate and were satisfied . The disciples picked up
NIRV	Matthew	14	21	The number of men who ate was about 5,000 . Women and children also ate . Jesus Walks on the Water
NIRV	Matthew	14	22	Right away Jesus made the disciples get into the boat . He had them go on ahead of him to the other side of the Sea of Galilee . Then he sent the crowd away .
NIRV	Matthew	14	23	After he had sent them away , he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray . Later that night , he was there alone .
NIRV	Matthew	14	24	The boat was already a long way from land . It was being pounded by the waves because the wind was blowing against it .
NIRV	Matthew	14	25	Shortly before dawn , Jesus went out to the disciples . He walked on the lake .
NIRV	Matthew	14	26	They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified . “ It ’ s a ghost ! ” they said . And they cried out in fear .
NIRV	Matthew	14	27	Right away Jesus called out to them , “ Be brave ! It is I. Don ’ t be afraid. ”
NIRV	Matthew	14	28	“ Lord , is it you ? ” Peter asked . “ If it is , tell me to come to you on the water. ”
NIRV	Matthew	14	29	“ Come , ” Jesus said . So Peter got out of the boat . He walked on the water toward Jesus .
NIRV	Matthew	14	30	But when Peter saw the wind , he was afraid . He began to sink . He cried out , “ Lord ! Save me ! ”
NIRV	Matthew	14	31	Right away Jesus reached out his hand and caught him . “ Your faith is so small ! ” he said . “ Why did you doubt me ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	14	32	When they climbed into the boat , the wind died down .
NIRV	Matthew	14	33	Then those in the boat worshiped Jesus . They said , “ You really are the Son of God ! ”
NIRV	Matthew	14	34	They crossed over the lake and landed at Gennesaret .
NIRV	Matthew	14	35	The men who lived there recognized Jesus . So they sent a message all over the nearby countryside . People brought all those who were sick to Jesus .
NIRV	Matthew	14	36	They begged him to let those who were sick just touch the edge of his clothes . And all who touched his clothes were healed . Copyright ©

NIRV	Matthew	15	15	Peter said , “ Explain this to us. ”
NIRV	Matthew	15	2	“ Why don ’ t your disciples obey what the elders teach ? Your disciples don ’ t wash their hands before they eat ! ”
NIRV	Matthew	15	3	Jesus replied , “ And why don ’ t you obey God ’ s command ? You would rather follow your own teachings !
NIRV	Matthew	15	4	God said , ‘ Honor your father and mother. ’ ( Exodus 20:12 ; Deuteronomy 5:16 ) He also said , ‘ Anyone who asks for bad things to happen to their father or mother must be put to death. ’ ( Exodus 21:17 ; Leviticus 20:9 )
NIRV	Matthew	15	5	But suppose people have something that might be used to help their parents . You allow them to say it is instead ‘ a gift set apart for God. ’
NIRV	Matthew	15	6	So they do not need to honor their father or mother with their gift . You make the word of God useless in order to follow your own teachings .
NIRV	Matthew	15	7	You pretenders ! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you . He said ,
NIRV	Matthew	15	8	“ ‘ These people honor me by what they say . But their hearts are far away from me .
NIRV	Matthew	15	9	Their worship doesn ’ t mean anything to me . They teach nothing but human rules. ’ ” ( Isaiah 29:13 )
NIRV	Matthew	15	10	Jesus called the crowd to him . He said , “ Listen and understand .
NIRV	Matthew	15	11	What goes into someone ’ s mouth does not make them ‘ unclean. ’ It ’ s what comes out of their mouth that makes them ‘ unclean. ’ ”
NIRV	Matthew	15	12	Then the disciples came to him . They asked , “ Do you know that the Pharisees were angry when they heard this ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	15	13	Jesus replied , “ They are plants that my Father in heaven has not planted . They will be pulled up by the roots .
NIRV	Matthew	15	14	Leave the Pharisees . They are blind guides . If one blind person leads another blind person , both of them will fall into a pit. ”
NIRV	Matthew	15	16	“ Don ’ t you understand yet ? ” Jesus asked them .
NIRV	Matthew	15	17	“ Don ’ t you see ? Everything that enters the mouth goes into the stomach . Then it goes out of the body .
NIRV	Matthew	15	18	But the things that come out of a person ’ s mouth come from the heart . Those are the things that make someone ‘ unclean. ’
NIRV	Matthew	15	19	Evil thoughts come out of a person ’ s heart . So do murder , adultery , and other sexual sins . And so do stealing , false witness , and telling lies about others .
NIRV	Matthew	15	20	Those are the things that make you ‘ unclean. ’ But eating without washing your hands does not make you ‘ unclean. ’ ” The Faith of a Woman From Canaan
NIRV	Matthew	15	21	Jesus left Galilee and went to the area of Tyre and Sidon .
NIRV	Matthew	15	22	A woman from Canaan lived near Tyre and Sidon . She came to him and cried out , “ Lord ! Son of David ! Have mercy on me ! A demon controls my daughter . She is suffering terribly. ”
NIRV	Matthew	15	23	Jesus did not say a word . So his disciples came to him . They begged him , “ Send her away . She keeps crying out after us. ”
NIRV	Matthew	15	24	Jesus answered , “ I was sent only to the people of Israel . They are like lost sheep. ”
NIRV	Matthew	15	25	Then the woman fell to her knees in front of him . “ Lord ! Help me ! ” she said .
NIRV	Matthew	15	26	He replied , “ It is not right to take the children ’ s bread and throw it to the dogs. ”
NIRV	Matthew	15	27	“ Yes it is , Lord , ” she said . “ Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their owner ’ s table. ”
NIRV	Matthew	15	28	Then Jesus said to her , “ Woman , you have great faith ! You will be given what you are asking for. ” And her daughter was healed at that moment . Jesus Feeds Four Thousand
NIRV	Matthew	15	29	Jesus left there . He walked along the Sea of Galilee . Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down .
NIRV	Matthew	15	30	Large crowds came to him . They brought blind people and those who could not walk . They also brought disabled people , those who could not speak , and many others . They laid them at his feet , and he healed them .
NIRV	Matthew	15	31	The people were amazed . Those who could not speak were speaking . The disabled were made well . Those not able to walk were walking . Those who were blind could see . So the people praised the God of Israel .
NIRV	Matthew	15	32	Then Jesus called for his disciples to come to him . He said , “ I feel deep concern for these people . They have already been with me three days . They don ’ t have anything to eat . I don ’ t want to send them away hungry . If I do , they will become too weak on their way home. ”
NIRV	Matthew	15	33	His disciples answered him . “ There is nothing here , ” they said . “ Where could we get enough bread to feed this large crowd ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	15	34	“ How many loaves do you have ? ” Jesus asked . “ Seven , ” they replied , “ and a few small fish. ”
NIRV	Matthew	15	35	Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground .
NIRV	Matthew	15	36	He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks . Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples . And the disciples passed them out to the people .
NIRV	Matthew	15	37	All of them ate and were satisfied . After that , the disciples picked up seven baskets of leftover pieces .
NIRV	Matthew	15	38	The number of men who ate was 4,000 . Women and children also ate .

NIRV	Matthew	16	16	Simon Peter answered , “ You are the Messiah . You are the Son of the living God. ”
NIRV	Matthew	16	2	He replied , “ In the evening you look at the sky . You say , ‘ It will be good weather . The sky is red. ’
NIRV	Matthew	16	3	And in the morning you say , ‘ Today it will be stormy . The sky is red and cloudy. ’ You know the meaning of what you see in the sky . But you can ’ t understand the signs of what is happening right now .
NIRV	Matthew	16	4	An evil and unfaithful people look for a sign . But none will be given to them except the sign of Jonah. ” Then Jesus left them and went away . The Yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees
NIRV	Matthew	16	5	The disciples crossed over to the other side of the lake . They had forgotten to take bread .
NIRV	Matthew	16	6	“ Be careful , ” Jesus said to them . “ Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees. ”
NIRV	Matthew	16	7	The disciples talked about this among themselves . They said , “ He must be saying this because we didn ’ t bring any bread. ”
NIRV	Matthew	16	8	Jesus knew what they were saying . So he said , “ Your faith is so small ! Why are you talking to each other about having no bread ?
NIRV	Matthew	16	9	Don ’ t you understand yet ? Don ’ t you remember the five loaves for the 5,000 ? Don ’ t you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered ?
NIRV	Matthew	16	10	Don ’ t you remember the seven loaves for the 4,000 ? Don ’ t you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered ?
NIRV	Matthew	16	11	How can you possibly not understand ? I wasn ’ t talking to you about bread . But watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees. ”
NIRV	Matthew	16	12	Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to watch out for the yeast used in bread . He was warning them against what the Pharisees and Sadducees taught . Peter Says That Jesus Is the Messiah
NIRV	Matthew	16	13	Jesus went to the area of Caesarea Philippi . There he asked his disciples , “ Who do people say the Son of Man is ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	16	14	They replied , “ Some say John the Baptist . Others say Elijah . Still others say Jeremiah , or one of the prophets. ”
NIRV	Matthew	16	15	“ But what about you ? ” he asked . “ Who do you say I am ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	16	17	Jesus replied , “ Blessed are you , Simon , son of Jonah ! No mere human showed this to you . My Father in heaven showed it to you .
NIRV	Matthew	16	18	Here is what I tell you . You are Peter . On this rock I will build my church . The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it .
NIRV	Matthew	16	19	I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven . What you lock on earth will be locked in heaven . What you unlock on earth will be unlocked in heaven. ”
NIRV	Matthew	16	20	Then Jesus ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah . Jesus Speaks About His Coming Death
NIRV	Matthew	16	21	From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples what would happen to him . He told them he must go to Jerusalem . There he must suffer many things from the elders , the chief priests and the teachers of the law . He must be killed and on the third day rise to life again .
NIRV	Matthew	16	22	Peter took Jesus to one side and began to scold him . “ Never , Lord ! ” he said . “ This will never happen to you ! ”
NIRV	Matthew	16	23	Jesus turned and said to Peter , “ Get behind me , Satan ! You are standing in my way . You do not have in mind the things God cares about . Instead , you only have in mind the things humans care about. ”
NIRV	Matthew	16	24	Then Jesus spoke to his disciples . He said , “ Whoever wants to be my disciple must say no to themselves . They must pick up their cross and follow me .
NIRV	Matthew	16	25	Whoever wants to save their life will lose it . But whoever loses their life for me will find it .
NIRV	Matthew	16	26	What good is it if someone gains the whole world but loses their soul ? Or what can anyone trade for their soul ?
NIRV	Matthew	16	27	The Son of Man is going to come in his Father ’ s glory . His angels will come with him . And he will reward everyone in keeping with what they have done .
NIRV	Matthew	16	28	“ What I ’ m about to tell you is true . Some who are standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Matthew	17	2	There in front of them his appearance was changed . His face shone like the sun . His clothes became as white as the light .
NIRV	Matthew	17	3	Just then Moses and Elijah appeared in front of them . Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus .
NIRV	Matthew	17	4	Peter said to Jesus , “ Lord , it is good for us to be here . If you wish , I will put up three shelters . One will be for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah. ”
NIRV	Matthew	17	5	While Peter was still speaking , a bright cloud covered them . A voice from the cloud said , “ This is my Son , and I love him . I am very pleased with him . Listen to him ! ”
NIRV	Matthew	17	6	When the disciples heard this , they were terrified . They fell with their faces to the ground .

NIRV	Matthew	17	16	I brought him to your disciples . But they couldn ’ t heal him. ”

NIRV	Matthew	17	19	Then the disciples came to Jesus in private . They asked , “ Why couldn ’ t we drive out the demon ? ” 20-21 He replied , “ Because your faith is much too small .

It would be better to enter the kingdom of heaven with only one foot than go into hell with two feet . In hell the fire burns forever .

NIRV	Matthew	19	5	He said , ‘ That ’ s why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife . The two will become one. ’ ( Genesis 2:24 )

NIRV	Matthew	19	7	They asked , “ Then why did Moses command that a man can give his wife a letter of divorce and send her away ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	19	8	Jesus replied , “ Moses let you divorce your wives because you were stubborn . But it was not this way from the beginning .
NIRV	Matthew	19	9	Here is what I tell you . Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery . A man may divorce his wife only if she has not been faithful to him. ”
NIRV	Matthew	19	10	Here is what the disciples said to him . “ If that ’ s the way it is between a husband and wife , it is better not to get married. ”

NIRV	Matthew	19	17	“ Why do you ask me about what is good ? ” Jesus replied . “ There is only one who is good . If you want to enter the kingdom , obey the commandments. ”
NIRV	Matthew	19	18	“ Which ones ? ” the man asked . Jesus said , “ ‘ Do not murder . Do not commit adultery . Do not steal . Do not be a false witness .
NIRV	Matthew	19	20	“ I have obeyed all those commandments , ” the young man said . “ What else do I need to do ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	19	21	Jesus answered , “ If you want to be perfect , go and sell everything you have . Give the money to those who are poor . You will have treasure in heaven . Then come and follow me. ”
NIRV	Matthew	19	22	When the young man heard this , he went away sad . He was very rich .
NIRV	Matthew	19	23	Then Jesus said to his disciples , “ What I ’ m about to tell you is true . It is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven .

NIRV	Matthew	19	26	Jesus looked at them and said , “ With people , this is impossible . But with God , all things are possible. ”
NIRV	Matthew	19	27	Peter answered him , “ We have left everything to follow you ! What reward will be given to us ? ”

NIRV	Matthew	20	8	“ When evening came , the owner of the vineyard spoke to the person who was in charge of the workers . He said , ‘ Call the workers and give them their pay . Begin with the last ones I hired . Then go on to the first ones. ’

NIRV	Matthew	22	18	But Jesus knew their evil plans . He said , “ You pretenders ! Why are you trying to trap me ?
NIRV	Matthew	22	19	Show me the coin people use for paying the tax. ” They brought him a silver coin .
NIRV	Matthew	22	20	He asked them , “ Whose picture is this ? And whose words ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	22	21	“ Caesar ’ s , ” they replied . Then he said to them , “ So give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar . And give back to God what belongs to God. ”
NIRV	Matthew	22	23	That same day the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question . They do not believe that people rise from the dead .
NIRV	Matthew	22	24	“ Teacher , ” they said , “ here is what Moses told us . If a man dies without having children , his brother must get married to the widow . He must provide children to carry on his brother ’ s name .
NIRV	Matthew	22	25	There were seven brothers among us . The first one got married and died . Since he had no children , he left his wife to his brother .
NIRV	Matthew	22	26	The same thing happened to the second and third brothers . It happened right on down to the seventh brother .
NIRV	Matthew	22	27	Finally , the woman died .
NIRV	Matthew	22	28	Now then , when the dead rise , whose wife will she be ? All seven of them were married to her. ”
NIRV	Matthew	22	29	Jesus replied , “ You are mistaken , because you do not know the Scriptures . And you do not know the power of God .
NIRV	Matthew	22	30	When the dead rise , they won ’ t get married . And their parents won ’ t give them to be married . They will be like the angels in heaven .
NIRV	Matthew	22	31	What about the dead rising ? Haven ’ t you read what God said to you ?
NIRV	Matthew	22	32	He said , ‘ I am the God of Abraham . I am the God of Isaac . And I am the God of Jacob. ’ ( Exodus 3:6 ) He is not the God of the dead . He is the God of the living. ”
NIRV	Matthew	22	33	When the crowds heard this , they were amazed by what he taught . The Most Important Commandment
NIRV	Matthew	22	34	The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees weren ’ t able to answer Jesus . So the Pharisees got together .
NIRV	Matthew	22	35	One of them was an authority on the law . So he tested Jesus with a question .
NIRV	Matthew	22	36	“ Teacher , ” he asked , “ which is the most important commandment in the Law ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	22	37	Jesus replied , “ ‘ Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul . Love him with all your mind. ’ ( Deuteronomy 6:5 )
NIRV	Matthew	22	38	This is the first and most important commandment .
NIRV	Matthew	22	39	And the second is like it . ‘ Love your neighbor as you love yourself. ’ ( Leviticus 19:18 )
NIRV	Matthew	22	40	Everything that is written in the Law and the Prophets is based on these two commandments. ” Whose Son Is the Messiah ?
NIRV	Matthew	22	41	The Pharisees were gathered together . Jesus asked them ,
NIRV	Matthew	22	42	“ What do you think about the Messiah ? Whose son is he ? ” “ The son of David , ” they replied .
NIRV	Matthew	22	43	He said to them , “ Then why does David call him ‘ Lord ’ ? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself . David said ,
NIRV	Matthew	22	44	“ ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your control. ” ’ ( Psalm 110:1 )
NIRV	Matthew	22	45	So if David calls him ‘ Lord , ’ how can he be David ’ s son ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	22	46	No one could give any answer to him . From that day on , no one dared to ask him any more questions . Copyright ©

NIRV	Matthew	23	23	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You pretenders ! You give God a tenth of your spices , like mint , dill and cumin . But you have not practiced the more important things of the law , which are fairness , mercy and faithfulness . You should have practiced the last things without failing to do the first .
NIRV	Matthew	23	2	“ The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses ’ seat , ” he said .
NIRV	Matthew	23	3	“ So you must be careful to do everything they say . But don ’ t do what they do . They don ’ t practice what they preach .
NIRV	Matthew	23	4	They tie up heavy loads that are hard to carry . Then they put them on other people ’ s shoulders . But they themselves aren ’ t willing to lift a finger to move them .
NIRV	Matthew	23	5	“ Everything they do is done for others to see . On their foreheads and arms they wear little boxes that hold Scripture verses . They make the boxes very wide . And they make the tassels on their coats very long .
NIRV	Matthew	23	6	They love to sit down in the place of honor at dinners . They also love to have the most important seats in the synagogues .
NIRV	Matthew	23	7	They love to be greeted with respect in the markets . They love it when people call them ‘ Rabbi. ’
NIRV	Matthew	23	8	“ But you shouldn ’ t be called ‘ Rabbi. ’ You have only one Teacher , and you are all brothers .
NIRV	Matthew	23	9	Do not call anyone on earth ‘ father. ’ You have one Father , and he is in heaven .
NIRV	Matthew	23	10	You shouldn ’ t be called ‘ teacher. ’ You have one Teacher , and he is the Messiah .
NIRV	Matthew	23	11	The most important person among you will be your servant .
NIRV	Matthew	23	12	People who lift themselves up will be made humble . And people who make themselves humble will be lifted up . How Terrible for the Teachers of the Law and the Pharisees 13-14 “ How terrible it will be for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You pretenders ! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people ’ s faces . You yourselves do not enter . And you will not let those enter who are trying to .
NIRV	Matthew	23	15	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You pretenders ! You travel everywhere to win one person to your faith . Then you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are .
NIRV	Matthew	23	16	“ How terrible for you , blind guides ! You say , ‘ If anyone makes a promise in the name of the temple , it means nothing . But anyone who makes a promise in the name of the gold of the temple must keep that promise. ’
NIRV	Matthew	23	17	You are blind and foolish ! Which is more important ? Is it the gold ? Or is it the temple that makes the gold holy ?
NIRV	Matthew	23	18	You also say , ‘ If anyone makes a promise in the name of the altar , it means nothing . But anyone who makes a promise in the name of the gift on the altar must keep that promise. ’
NIRV	Matthew	23	19	You are blind ! Which is more important ? Is it the gift ? Or is it the altar that makes the gift holy ?
NIRV	Matthew	23	20	So anyone making a promise in the name of the altar makes a promise in the name of it and everything on it .
NIRV	Matthew	23	21	And anyone making a promise in the name of the temple makes a promise in the name of it and the one who lives in it .
NIRV	Matthew	23	22	And anyone making a promise in the name of heaven makes a promise in the name of God ’ s throne and the one who sits on it .
NIRV	Matthew	23	24	You blind guides ! You remove the smallest insect from your food . But you swallow a whole camel !
NIRV	Matthew	23	25	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You pretenders ! You clean the outside of a cup and dish . But on the inside you are full of greed . You only want to satisfy yourselves .
NIRV	Matthew	23	26	Blind Pharisee ! First clean the inside of the cup and dish . Then the outside will also be clean .
NIRV	Matthew	23	27	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You pretenders ! You are like tombs that are painted white . They look beautiful on the outside . But on the inside they are full of the bones of the dead . They are also full of other things that are not pure and ‘ clean. ’
NIRV	Matthew	23	28	It is the same with you . On the outside you seem to be doing what is right . But on the inside you are full of what is wrong . You pretend to be what you are not .
NIRV	Matthew	23	29	“ How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You pretenders ! You build tombs for the prophets . You decorate the graves of the godly .
NIRV	Matthew	23	30	And you say , ‘ If we had lived in the days of those who lived before us , we wouldn ’ t have done what they did . We wouldn ’ t have helped to kill the prophets. ’
NIRV	Matthew	23	31	So you are witnesses against yourselves . You admit that you are the children of those who murdered the prophets .
NIRV	Matthew	23	32	So go ahead and finish the sins that those who lived before you started !
NIRV	Matthew	23	33	“ You nest of poisonous snakes ! How will you escape from being sentenced to hell ?
NIRV	Matthew	23	34	So I am sending you prophets , wise people , and teachers . You will kill some of them . You will nail some to a cross . Others you will whip in your synagogues . You will chase them from town to town .
NIRV	Matthew	23	35	So you will pay for all the godly people ’ s blood spilled on earth . I mean from the blood of godly Abel to the blood of Zechariah , the son of Berekiah . Zechariah was the one you murdered between the temple and the altar .
NIRV	Matthew	23	36	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . All this will happen to those who are now living .
NIRV	Matthew	23	37	“ Jerusalem ! Jerusalem ! You kill the prophets and throw stones in order to kill those who are sent to you . Many times I have wanted to gather your people together . I have wanted to be like a hen who gathers her chicks under her wings . And you would not let me !
NIRV	Matthew	23	38	Look , your house is left empty .

NIRV	Matthew	24	3	Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives . There the disciples came to him in private . “ Tell us , ” they said . “ When will this happen ? And what will be the sign of your coming ? What will be the sign of the end ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	24	4	Jesus answered , “ Keep watch ! Be careful that no one fools you .
NIRV	Matthew	24	5	Many will come in my name . They will claim , ‘ I am the Messiah ! ’ They will fool many people .
NIRV	Matthew	24	6	You will hear about wars . You will also hear people talking about future wars . Don ’ t be alarmed . Those things must happen . But the end still isn ’ t here .
NIRV	Matthew	24	7	Nation will fight against nation . Kingdom will fight against kingdom . People will go hungry . There will be earthquakes in many places .
NIRV	Matthew	24	8	All these are the beginning of birth pains .
NIRV	Matthew	24	9	“ Then people will hand you over to be treated badly and killed . All nations will hate you because of me .
NIRV	Matthew	24	10	At that time , many will turn away from their faith . They will hate each other . They will hand each other over to their enemies .
NIRV	Matthew	24	11	Many false prophets will appear . They will fool many people .
NIRV	Matthew	24	12	Because evil will grow , most people ’ s love will grow cold .
NIRV	Matthew	24	13	But the one who remains strong in the faith will be saved .
NIRV	Matthew	24	14	This good news of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world . It will be a witness to all nations . Then the end will come .
NIRV	Matthew	24	15	“ The prophet Daniel spoke about ‘ the hated thing that destroys. ’ ( Daniel 9:27 ; 11:31 ; 12:11 ) Someday you will see it standing in the holy place . The reader should understand this .

NIRV	Matthew	24	17	No one on the housetop should go down into the house to take anything out .
NIRV	Matthew	24	18	No one in the field should go back to get their coat .
NIRV	Matthew	24	19	How awful it will be in those days for pregnant women ! How awful for nursing mothers !
NIRV	Matthew	24	20	Pray that you will not have to escape in winter or on the Sabbath day .
NIRV	Matthew	24	21	There will be terrible suffering in those days . It will be worse than any other from the beginning of the world until now . And there will never be anything like it again .
NIRV	Matthew	24	22	“ If the time had not been cut short , no one would live . But because of God ’ s chosen people , it will be shortened .
NIRV	Matthew	24	23	At that time someone may say to you , ‘ Look ! Here is the Messiah ! ’ Or , ‘ There he is ! ’ Do not believe it .
NIRV	Matthew	24	25	See , I have told you ahead of time .
NIRV	Matthew	24	26	“ So if anyone tells you , ‘ He is a long way out in the desert , ’ do not go out there . Or if anyone says , ‘ He is deep inside the house , ’ do not believe it .

NIRV	Matthew	24	32	“ Learn a lesson from the fig tree . As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out , you know that summer is near .

NIRV	Matthew	24	34	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . The people living now will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened .
NIRV	Matthew	24	35	Heaven and earth will pass away . But my words will never pass away . The Day and Hour Are Not Known
NIRV	Matthew	24	36	“ But no one knows about that day or hour . Not even the angels in heaven know . The Son does not know . Only the Father knows .
NIRV	Matthew	24	37	Remember how it was in the days of Noah . It will be the same when the Son of Man comes .
NIRV	Matthew	24	38	In the days before the flood , people were eating and drinking . They were getting married . They were giving their daughters to be married . They did all those things right up to the day Noah entered the ark .
NIRV	Matthew	24	39	They knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away . That is how it will be when the Son of Man comes .
NIRV	Matthew	24	40	Two men will be in the field . One will be taken and the other left .
NIRV	Matthew	24	41	Two women will be grinding with a hand mill . One will be taken and the other left .
NIRV	Matthew	24	42	“ So keep watch . You do not know on what day your Lord will come .
NIRV	Matthew	24	43	You must understand something . Suppose the owner of the house knew what time of night the robber was coming . Then he would have kept watch . He would not have let his house be broken into .
NIRV	Matthew	24	44	So you also must be ready . The Son of Man will come at an hour when you don ’ t expect him .
NIRV	Matthew	24	45	“ Suppose a master puts one of his slaves in charge of the other slaves in his house . The slave ’ s job is to give them their food at the right time . The master wants a faithful and wise slave for this .
NIRV	Matthew	24	46	It will be good for the slave if the master finds him doing his job when the master returns .
NIRV	Matthew	24	47	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . The master will put that slave in charge of everything he owns .

NIRV	Matthew	25	14	“ Again , here is what the kingdom of heaven will be like . A man was going on a journey . He sent for his slaves and put them in charge of his money .
NIRV	Matthew	25	15	He gave five bags of gold to one . He gave two bags to another . And he gave one bag to the third . The man gave each slave the amount of money he knew the slave could take care of . Then he went on his journey .
NIRV	Matthew	25	16	The slave who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work . He earned five bags more .
NIRV	Matthew	25	17	The one with the two bags of gold earned two more .
NIRV	Matthew	25	18	But the man who had received one bag went and dug a hole in the ground . He hid his master ’ s money in it .
NIRV	Matthew	25	19	“ After a long time the master of those slaves returned . He wanted to collect all the money they had earned .
NIRV	Matthew	25	20	The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five . ‘ Master , ’ he said , ‘ you trusted me with five bags of gold . See , I have earned five more. ’
NIRV	Matthew	25	21	“ His master replied , ‘ You have done well , good and faithful slave ! You have been faithful with a few things . I will put you in charge of many things . Come and share your master ’ s happiness ! ’
NIRV	Matthew	25	22	“ The man with two bags of gold also came . ‘ Master , ’ he said , ‘ you trusted me with two bags of gold . See , I have earned two more. ’
NIRV	Matthew	25	23	“ His master replied , ‘ You have done well , good and faithful slave ! You have been faithful with a few things . I will put you in charge of many things . Come and share your master ’ s happiness ! ’
NIRV	Matthew	25	24	“ Then the man who had received one bag of gold came . ‘ Master , ’ he said , ‘ I knew that you are a hard man . You harvest where you have not planted . You gather crops where you have not scattered seed .
NIRV	Matthew	25	26	“ His master replied , ‘ You evil , lazy slave ! So you knew that I harvest where I have not planted ? You knew that I gather crops where I have not scattered seed ?
NIRV	Matthew	25	27	Well then , you should have put my money in the bank . When I returned , I would have received it back with interest. ’
NIRV	Matthew	25	28	“ Then his master commanded the other slaves , ‘ Take the bag of gold from him . Give it to the one who has ten bags .
NIRV	Matthew	25	29	Everyone who has will be given more . They will have more than enough . And what about anyone who doesn ’ t have ? Even what they have will be taken away from them .

NIRV	Matthew	26	27	Then he took a cup . He gave thanks and handed it to them . He said , “ All of you drink from it .
NIRV	Matthew	26	28	This is my blood of the covenant . It is poured out to forgive the sins of many people .
NIRV	Matthew	26	29	Here is what I tell you . From now on , I won ’ t drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my Father ’ s kingdom. ”
NIRV	Matthew	26	31	Jesus told them , “ This very night you will all turn away because of me . It is written that the Lord said , “ ‘ I will strike the shepherd down . Then the sheep of the flock will be scattered. ’ ( Zechariah 13:7 )
NIRV	Matthew	26	32	But after I rise from the dead , I will go ahead of you into Galilee. ”
NIRV	Matthew	26	33	Peter replied , “ All the others may turn away because of you . But I never will. ”
NIRV	Matthew	26	34	“ What I ’ m about to tell you is true , ” Jesus answered . “ It will happen tonight . Before the rooster crows , you will say three times that you don ’ t know me. ”
NIRV	Matthew	26	35	But Peter said , “ I may have to die with you . But I will never say I don ’ t know you. ” And all the other disciples said the same thing . Jesus Prays in Gethsemane
NIRV	Matthew	26	36	Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane . He said to them , “ Sit here while I go over there and pray. ”
NIRV	Matthew	26	37	He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him . He began to be sad and troubled .
NIRV	Matthew	26	38	Then he said to them , “ My soul is very sad . I feel close to death . Stay here . Keep watch with me. ”
NIRV	Matthew	26	39	He went a little farther . Then he fell with his face to the ground . He prayed , “ My Father , if it is possible , take this cup of suffering away from me . But let what you want be done , not what I want. ”
NIRV	Matthew	26	40	Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping . “ Couldn ’ t you men keep watch with me for one hour ? ” he asked Peter .
NIRV	Matthew	26	41	“ Watch and pray . Then you won ’ t fall into sin when you are tempted . The spirit is willing , but the body is weak. ”
NIRV	Matthew	26	42	Jesus went away a second time . He prayed , “ My Father , is it possible for this cup to be taken away ? But if I must drink it , may what you want be done. ”
NIRV	Matthew	26	43	Then he came back . Again he found them sleeping . They couldn ’ t keep their eyes open .
NIRV	Matthew	26	44	So he left them and went away once more . For the third time he prayed the same thing .
NIRV	Matthew	26	45	Then he returned to the disciples . He said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? Look ! The hour has come . The Son of Man is about to be handed over to sinners .
NIRV	Matthew	26	46	Get up ! Let us go ! Here comes the one who is handing me over to them ! ” Jesus Is Arrested
NIRV	Matthew	26	47	While Jesus was still speaking , Judas arrived . He was one of the
NIRV	Matthew	26	48	Judas , who was going to hand Jesus over , had arranged a signal with them . “ The one I kiss is the man , ” he said . “ Arrest him. ”
NIRV	Matthew	26	49	So Judas went to Jesus at once . He said , “ Greetings , Rabbi ! ” And he kissed him .
NIRV	Matthew	26	50	Jesus replied , “ Friend , do what you came to do. ” Then the men stepped forward . They grabbed Jesus and arrested him .
NIRV	Matthew	26	51	At that moment , one of Jesus ’ companions reached for his sword . He pulled it out and struck the slave of the high priest with it . He cut off the slave ’ s ear .
NIRV	Matthew	26	52	“ Put your sword back in its place , ” Jesus said to him . “ All who use the sword will die by the sword .
NIRV	Matthew	26	53	Do you think I can ’ t ask my Father for help ? He would send an army of more than 70,000 angels right away .
NIRV	Matthew	26	54	But then how would the Scriptures come true ? They say it must happen in this way. ”
NIRV	Matthew	26	55	At that time Jesus spoke to the crowd . “ Am I leading a band of armed men against you ? ” he asked . “ Do you have to come out with swords and clubs to capture me ? Every day I sat in the temple courtyard teaching . And you didn ’ t arrest me .
NIRV	Matthew	26	56	But all this has happened so that the words of the prophets would come true. ” Then all the disciples left him and ran away . Jesus Is Taken to the Sanhedrin
NIRV	Matthew	26	57	Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas , the high priest . The teachers of the law and the elders had come together there .
NIRV	Matthew	26	58	Not too far away , Peter followed Jesus . He went right up to the courtyard of the high priest . He entered and sat down with the guards to see what would happen .
NIRV	Matthew	26	59	The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for something to use against Jesus . They wanted to put him to death .
NIRV	Matthew	26	60	But they did not find any proof , even though many false witnesses came forward . Finally , two other witnesses came forward .
NIRV	Matthew	26	61	They said , “ This fellow claimed , ‘ I am able to destroy the temple of God . I can build it again in three days. ’ ”
NIRV	Matthew	26	62	Then the high priest stood up . He asked Jesus , “ Aren ’ t you going to answer ? What are these charges that these men are bringing against you ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	26	63	But Jesus remained silent . The high priest said to him , “ I am commanding you in the name of the living God . May he judge you if you don ’ t tell the truth . Tell us if you are the Messiah , the Son of God. ”
NIRV	Matthew	26	64	“ You have said so , ” Jesus replied . “ But here is what I say to all of you . From now on , you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One . You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven. ”
NIRV	Matthew	26	65	Then the high priest tore his clothes . He said , “ He has spoken a very evil thing against God ! Why do we need any more witnesses ? You have heard him say this evil thing .
NIRV	Matthew	26	66	What do you think ? ” “ He must die ! ” they answered .
NIRV	Matthew	26	67	Then they spit in his face . They hit him with their fists . Others slapped him .
NIRV	Matthew	26	68	They said , “ Prophesy to us , Messiah ! Who hit you ? ” Peter Says He Does Not Know Jesus
NIRV	Matthew	26	69	Peter was sitting out in the courtyard . A female servant came to him . “ You also were with Jesus of Galilee , ” she said .
NIRV	Matthew	26	70	But in front of all of them , Peter said he was not . “ I don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about , ” he said .
NIRV	Matthew	26	71	Then he went out to the gate leading into the courtyard . There another servant saw him . She said to the people , “ This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth. ”
NIRV	Matthew	26	72	Again he said he was not . With a curse he said , “ I don ’ t know the man ! ”
NIRV	Matthew	26	73	After a little while , those standing there went up to Peter . “ You must be one of them , ” they said . “ The way you talk gives you away. ”
NIRV	Matthew	26	74	Then Peter began to curse and said to them , “ I don ’ t know the man ! ” Right away a rooster crowed .
NIRV	Matthew	26	75	Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said . “ The rooster will crow , ” Jesus had told him . “ Before it does , you will say three times that you don ’ t know me. ” Peter went outside . He broke down and cried . Copyright ©

NIRV	Matthew	27	27	The governor ’ s soldiers took Jesus into the palace , which was called the Praetorium . All the rest of the soldiers gathered around him .
NIRV	Matthew	27	2	So they tied him up and led him away . Then they handed him over to Pilate , who was the governor .
NIRV	Matthew	27	3	Judas , who had handed him over , saw that Jesus had been sentenced to die . He felt deep shame and sadness for what he had done . So he returned the
NIRV	Matthew	27	30	They spit on him . They hit him on the head with the stick again and again .
NIRV	Matthew	27	4	“ I have sinned , ” he said . “ I handed over a man who is not guilty. ” “ What do we care ? ” they replied . “ That ’ s your problem. ”
NIRV	Matthew	27	5	So Judas threw the money into the temple and left . Then he went away and hanged himself .
NIRV	Matthew	27	6	The chief priests picked up the coins . They said , “ It ’ s against the law to put this money into the temple fund . It is blood money . It has paid for a man ’ s death. ”
NIRV	Matthew	27	7	So they decided to use the money to buy a potter ’ s field . People from other countries would be buried there .
NIRV	Matthew	27	8	That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day .
NIRV	Matthew	27	9	Then the words spoken by Jeremiah the prophet came true . He had said , “ They took the
NIRV	Matthew	27	10	They used the coins to buy a potter ’ s field , just as the Lord commanded me. ” ( Zechariah 11:12,13 ; Jeremiah 19:1–13 ; 32:6–9 ) Jesus Is Brought to Pilate
NIRV	Matthew	27	11	Jesus was standing in front of the governor . The governor asked him , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” “ Yes . You have said so , ” Jesus replied .
NIRV	Matthew	27	12	But when the chief priests and the elders brought charges against him , he did not answer .
NIRV	Matthew	27	13	Then Pilate asked him , “ Don ’ t you hear the charges they are bringing against you ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	27	14	But Jesus made no reply , not even to a single charge . The governor was really amazed .
NIRV	Matthew	27	15	It was the governor ’ s practice at the Passover Feast to let one prisoner go free . The people could choose the one they wanted .
NIRV	Matthew	27	16	At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Jesus Barabbas .
NIRV	Matthew	27	17	So when the crowd gathered , Pilate asked them , “ Which one do you want me to set free ? Jesus Barabbas ? Or Jesus who is called the Messiah ? ”
NIRV	Matthew	27	18	Pilate knew that the leaders wanted to get their own way . He knew this was why they had handed Jesus over to him .
NIRV	Matthew	27	19	While Pilate was sitting on the judge ’ s seat , his wife sent him a message . It said , “ Don ’ t have anything to do with that man . He is not guilty . I have suffered a great deal in a dream today because of him. ”
NIRV	Matthew	27	20	But the chief priests and the elders talked the crowd into asking for Barabbas and having Jesus put to death .
NIRV	Matthew	27	21	“ Which of the two do you want me to set free ? ” asked the governor . “ Barabbas , ” they answered .
NIRV	Matthew	27	22	“ Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Messiah ? ” Pilate asked . They all answered , “ Crucify him ! ”
NIRV	Matthew	27	23	“ Why ? What wrong has he done ? ” asked Pilate . But they shouted even louder , “ Crucify him ! ”
NIRV	Matthew	27	24	Pilate saw that he wasn ’ t getting anywhere . Instead , the crowd was starting to get angry . So he took water and washed his hands in front of them . “ I am not guilty of this man ’ s death , ” he said . “ You are accountable for that ! ”
NIRV	Matthew	27	25	All the people answered , “ Put the blame for his death on us and our children ! ”
NIRV	Matthew	27	26	Pilate let Barabbas go free . But he had Jesus whipped . Then he handed him over to be nailed to a cross . The Soldiers Make Fun of Jesus
NIRV	Matthew	27	28	They took off his clothes and put a purple robe on him .
NIRV	Matthew	27	29	Then they twisted thorns together to make a crown . They placed it on his head . They put a stick in his right hand . Then they fell on their knees in front of him and made fun of him . “ We honor you , king of the Jews ! ” they said .
NIRV	Matthew	27	31	After they had made fun of him , they took off the robe . They put his own clothes back on him . Then they led him away to nail him to a cross . Jesus Is Nailed to a Cross
NIRV	Matthew	27	32	On their way out of the city , they met a man from Cyrene . His name was Simon . They forced him to carry the cross .
NIRV	Matthew	27	33	They came to a place called Golgotha . The word Golgotha means the Place of the Skull .
NIRV	Matthew	27	34	There they mixed wine with bitter spices and gave it to Jesus to drink . After tasting it , he refused to drink it .
NIRV	Matthew	27	35	When they had nailed him to the cross , they divided up his clothes by casting lots .
NIRV	Matthew	27	36	They sat down and kept watch over him there .
NIRV	Matthew	27	37	Above his head they placed the written charge against him . It read , this is jesus , the king of the jews .
NIRV	Matthew	27	38	Two rebels against Rome were crucified with him . One was on his right and one was on his left .
NIRV	Matthew	27	39	Those who passed by shouted at Jesus and made fun of him . They shook their heads
NIRV	Matthew	27	40	and said , “ So you are going to destroy the temple and build it again in three days ? Then save yourself ! Come down from the cross , if you are the Son of God ! ”
NIRV	Matthew	27	41	In the same way the chief priests , the teachers of the law and the elders made fun of him .
NIRV	Matthew	27	42	“ He saved others , ” they said . “ But he can ’ t save himself ! He ’ s the king of Israel ! Let him come down now from the cross ! Then we will believe in him .
NIRV	Matthew	27	43	He trusts in God . Let God rescue him now if he wants him . He ’ s the one who said , ‘ I am the Son of God. ’ ”
NIRV	Matthew	27	44	In the same way the rebels who were being crucified with Jesus also made fun of him . Jesus Dies
NIRV	Matthew	27	45	From noon until three o ’ clock , the whole land was covered with darkness .
NIRV	Matthew	27	46	About three o ’ clock , Jesus cried out in a loud voice . He said , “ Eli , Eli , lema sabachthani ? ” This means “ My God , my God , why have you deserted me ? ” ( Psalm 22:1 )
NIRV	Matthew	27	47	Some of those standing there heard Jesus cry out . They said , “ He ’ s calling for Elijah. ”
NIRV	Matthew	27	48	Right away one of them ran and got a sponge . He filled it with wine vinegar and put it on a stick . He offered it to Jesus to drink .
NIRV	Matthew	27	49	The rest said , “ Leave him alone . Let ’ s see if Elijah comes to save him. ”
NIRV	Matthew	27	50	After Jesus cried out again in a loud voice , he died .
NIRV	Matthew	27	51	At that moment the temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom . The earth shook . The rocks split .
NIRV	Matthew	27	52	Tombs broke open . The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life .
NIRV	Matthew	27	53	They came out of the tombs . After Jesus was raised from the dead , they went into the holy city . There they appeared to many people .
NIRV	Matthew	27	54	The Roman commander and those guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened . They were terrified . They exclaimed , “ He was surely the Son of God ! ”
NIRV	Matthew	27	55	Not very far away , many women were watching . They had followed Jesus from Galilee to take care of his needs .
NIRV	Matthew	27	56	Mary Magdalene was among them . Mary , the mother of James and Joseph , was also there . So was the mother of Zebedee ’ s sons . Jesus Is Buried
NIRV	Matthew	27	57	As evening approached , a rich man came from the town of Arimathea . His name was Joseph . He had become a follower of Jesus .
NIRV	Matthew	27	58	He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus ’ body . Pilate ordered that it be given to him .
NIRV	Matthew	27	59	Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth .
NIRV	Matthew	27	60	He placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock . He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb . Then he went away .
NIRV	Matthew	27	61	Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there across from the tomb . The Guards at the Tomb
NIRV	Matthew	27	62	The next day was the day after Preparation Day . The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate .
NIRV	Matthew	27	63	“ Sir , ” they said , “ we remember something that liar said while he was still alive . He claimed , ‘ After three days I will rise again. ’
NIRV	Matthew	27	64	So give the order to make the tomb secure until the third day . If you don ’ t , his disciples might come and steal the body . Then they will tell the people that Jesus has been raised from the dead . This last lie will be worse than the first. ”
NIRV	Matthew	27	65	“ Take some guards with you , ” Pilate answered . “ Go . Make the tomb as secure as you can. ”
NIRV	Matthew	27	66	So they went and made the tomb secure . They put a royal seal on the stone and placed some guards on duty . Copyright ©

NIRV	Matthew	28	28	The Sabbath day was now over . It was dawn on the first day of the week . Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb .
NIRV	Matthew	28	2	There was a powerful earthquake . An angel of the Lord came down from heaven . The angel went to the tomb . He rolled back the stone and sat on it .
NIRV	Matthew	28	3	His body shone like lightning . His clothes were as white as snow .
NIRV	Matthew	28	4	The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men .
NIRV	Matthew	28	5	The angel said to the women , “ Don ’ t be afraid . I know that you are looking for Jesus , who was crucified .
NIRV	Matthew	28	6	He is not here ! He has risen , just as he said he would ! Come and see the place where he was lying .
NIRV	Matthew	28	7	Go quickly ! Tell his disciples , ‘ He has risen from the dead . He is going ahead of you into Galilee . There you will see him. ’ Now I have told you. ”
NIRV	Matthew	28	8	So the women hurried away from the tomb . They were afraid , but they were filled with joy . They ran to tell the disciples .
NIRV	Matthew	28	9	Suddenly Jesus met them . “ Greetings ! ” he said . They came to him , took hold of his feet and worshiped him .

NIRV	Matthew	28	13	They told the soldiers , “ We want you to say , ‘ His disciples came during the night . They stole his body while we were sleeping. ’
NIRV	Matthew	28	14	If the governor hears this report , we will pay him off . That will keep you out of trouble. ”

NIRV	Mark	1	1	This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah , the Son of God .
NIRV	Mark	1	2	Long ago Isaiah the prophet wrote , “ I will send my messenger ahead of you . He will prepare your way. ” ( Malachi 3:1 )
NIRV	Mark	1	3	“ A messenger is calling out in the desert , ‘ Prepare the way for the Lord . Make straight paths for him. ’ ” ( Isaiah 40:3 )
NIRV	Mark	1	4	And so John the Baptist appeared in the desert . He preached that people should be baptized and turn away from their sins . Then God would forgive them .
NIRV	Mark	1	5	All the people from the countryside of Judea went out to him . All the people from Jerusalem went too . When they admitted they had sinned , John baptized them in the Jordan River .
NIRV	Mark	1	6	John wore clothes made out of camel ’ s hair . He had a leather belt around his waist . And he ate locusts and wild honey .
NIRV	Mark	1	7	Here is what John was preaching . “ After me , there is someone coming who is more powerful than I am . I ’ m not good enough to bend down and untie his sandals .
NIRV	Mark	1	8	I baptize you with water . But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. ” Jesus Is Baptized and Tempted
NIRV	Mark	1	9	At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee . John baptized Jesus in the Jordan River .
NIRV	Mark	1	10	Jesus was coming up out of the water . Just then he saw heaven being torn open . Jesus saw the Holy Spirit coming down on him like a dove .
NIRV	Mark	1	11	A voice spoke to him from heaven . It said , “ You are my Son , and I love you . I am very pleased with you. ”
NIRV	Mark	1	12	At once the Holy Spirit sent Jesus out into the desert .
NIRV	Mark	1	13	He was in the desert
NIRV	Mark	1	40	A man who had a skin disease came to Jesus . On his knees he begged Jesus . He said , “ If you are willing to make me ‘ clean , ’ you can do it. ”
NIRV	Mark	1	14	After John was put in prison , Jesus went into Galilee . He preached the good news of God .
NIRV	Mark	1	15	“ The time has come , ” he said . “ The kingdom of God has come near . Turn away from your sins and believe the good news ! ” Jesus Chooses His First Disciples
NIRV	Mark	1	16	One day Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee . There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew . They were throwing a net into the lake . They were fishermen .
NIRV	Mark	1	17	“ Come and follow me , ” Jesus said . “ I will send you out to fish for people. ”
NIRV	Mark	1	18	At once they left their nets and followed him .
NIRV	Mark	1	19	Then Jesus walked a little farther . As he did , he saw James , the son of Zebedee , and his brother John . They were in a boat preparing their nets .
NIRV	Mark	1	20	Right away he called out to them . They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men . Then they followed Jesus . Jesus Drives Out an Evil Spirit
NIRV	Mark	1	21	Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum . When the Sabbath day came , he went into the synagogue . There he began to teach .
NIRV	Mark	1	22	The people were amazed at his teaching . That ’ s because he taught them like one who had authority . He did not talk like the teachers of the law .
NIRV	Mark	1	23	Just then a man in their synagogue cried out . He was controlled by an evil spirit . He said ,
NIRV	Mark	1	24	“ What do you want with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are . You are the Holy One of God ! ”
NIRV	Mark	1	25	“ Be quiet ! ” said Jesus firmly . “ Come out of him ! ”
NIRV	Mark	1	26	The evil spirit shook the man wildly . Then it came out of him with a scream .
NIRV	Mark	1	27	All the people were amazed . So they asked each other , “ What is this ? A new teaching ! And with so much authority ! He even gives orders to evil spirits , and they obey him. ”
NIRV	Mark	1	28	News about Jesus spread quickly all over Galilee . Jesus Heals Many People
NIRV	Mark	1	29	Jesus and those with him left the synagogue . Right away they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew .
NIRV	Mark	1	30	Simon ’ s mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever . They told Jesus about her right away .
NIRV	Mark	1	31	So he went to her . He took her hand and helped her up . The fever left her . Then she began to serve them .
NIRV	Mark	1	32	That evening after sunset , the people brought to Jesus all who were sick . They also brought all who were controlled by demons .
NIRV	Mark	1	33	All the people in town gathered at the door .
NIRV	Mark	1	34	Jesus healed many of them . They had all kinds of sicknesses . He also drove out many demons . But he would not let the demons speak , because they knew who he was . Jesus Prays in a Quiet Place
NIRV	Mark	1	35	It was very early in the morning and still dark . Jesus got up and left the house . He went to a place where he could be alone . There he prayed .
NIRV	Mark	1	36	Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus .
NIRV	Mark	1	37	When they found him , they called out , “ Everyone is looking for you ! ”
NIRV	Mark	1	38	Jesus replied , “ Let ’ s go somewhere else . I want to go to the nearby towns . I must preach there also . That is why I have come. ”
NIRV	Mark	1	39	So he traveled all around Galilee . He preached in their synagogues . He also drove out demons . Jesus Heals a Man Who Had a Skin Disease
NIRV	Mark	1	41	Jesus became angry . He reached out his hand and touched the man . “ I am willing to do it , ” Jesus said . “ Be ‘ clean ’ ! ”
NIRV	Mark	1	42	Right away the disease left the man , and he was “ clean. ”
NIRV	Mark	1	43	Jesus sent him away at once . He gave the man a strong warning .
NIRV	Mark	1	44	“ Don ’ t tell this to anyone , ” he said . “ Go and show yourself to the priest . Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded . It will be a witness to the priest and the people that you are ‘ clean. ’ ”
NIRV	Mark	1	45	But the man went out and started talking right away . He spread the news to everyone . So Jesus could no longer enter a town openly . He stayed outside in lonely places . But people still came to him from everywhere . Copyright ©

NIRV	Mark	2	2	So many people gathered that there was no room left . There was not even room outside the door . And Jesus preached the word to them .
NIRV	Mark	2	3	Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk .
NIRV	Mark	2	4	But they could not get him close to Jesus because of the crowd . So they made a hole by digging through the roof above Jesus . Then they lowered the man through it on a mat .
NIRV	Mark	2	5	Jesus saw their faith . So he said to the man , “ Son , your sins are forgiven. ”
NIRV	Mark	2	6	Some teachers of the law were sitting there . They were thinking ,
NIRV	Mark	2	7	“ Why is this fellow talking like that ? He ’ s saying a very evil thing ! Only God can forgive sins ! ”
NIRV	Mark	2	8	Right away Jesus knew what they were thinking . So he said to them , “ Why are you thinking these things ?
NIRV	Mark	2	9	Is it easier to say to this man , ‘ Your sins are forgiven ’ ? Or to say , ‘ Get up , take your mat and walk ’ ?
NIRV	Mark	2	10	But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. ” So Jesus spoke to the man who could not walk .
NIRV	Mark	2	11	“ I tell you , ” he said , “ get up . Take your mat and go home. ”

NIRV	Mark	2	14	As he walked along he saw Levi , the son of Alphaeus . Levi was sitting at the tax collector ’ s booth . “ Follow me , ” Jesus told him . Levi got up and followed him .
NIRV	Mark	2	15	Later Jesus was having dinner at Levi ’ s house . Many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples . They were part of the large crowd following Jesus .
NIRV	Mark	2	16	Some teachers of the law who were Pharisees were there . They saw Jesus eating with sinners and tax collectors . So they asked his disciples , “ Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
NIRV	Mark	2	17	Jesus heard that . So he said to them , “ Those who are healthy don ’ t need a doctor . Sick people do . I have not come to get those who think they are right with God to follow me . I have come to get sinners to follow me. ” Jesus Is Asked About Fasting
NIRV	Mark	2	18	John ’ s disciples and the Pharisees were going without eating . Some people came to Jesus . They said to him , “ John ’ s disciples are fasting . The disciples of the Pharisees are also fasting . But your disciples are not . Why aren ’ t they ? ”
NIRV	Mark	2	19	Jesus answered , “ How can the guests of the groom go without eating while he is with them ? They will not fast as long as he is with them .
NIRV	Mark	2	20	But the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them . On that day they will go without eating .
NIRV	Mark	2	21	“ No one sews a patch of new cloth on old clothes . Otherwise , the new piece will pull away from the old . That will make the tear worse .

NIRV	Mark	2	23	One Sabbath day Jesus was walking with his disciples through the grainfields . The disciples began to break off some heads of grain .
NIRV	Mark	2	24	The Pharisees said to Jesus , “ Look ! It is against the Law to do this on the Sabbath day . Why are your disciples doing it ? ”
NIRV	Mark	2	25	He answered , “ Haven ’ t you ever read about what David did ? He and his men were hungry . They needed food .
NIRV	Mark	2	26	It was when Abiathar was high priest . David entered the house of God and ate the holy bread . Only priests were allowed to eat it . David also gave some to his men. ”
NIRV	Mark	2	27	Then Jesus said to them , “ The Sabbath day was made for man . Man was not made for the Sabbath day .
NIRV	Mark	2	28	So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath day. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Mark	3	3	Jesus spoke to the man with the weak and twisted hand . “ Stand up in front of everyone , ” he said .
NIRV	Mark	3	2	Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus . They watched him closely . They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day .
NIRV	Mark	3	4	Then Jesus asked them , “ What does the Law say we should do on the Sabbath day ? Should we do good ? Or should we do evil ? Should we save life ? Or should we kill ? ” But no one answered .
NIRV	Mark	3	5	Jesus looked around at them in anger . He was very upset because their hearts were stubborn . Then he said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand. ” He stretched it out , and his hand had become as good as new .
NIRV	Mark	3	6	Then the Pharisees went out and began to make plans with the Herodians . They wanted to kill Jesus . Crowds Follow Jesus
NIRV	Mark	3	7	Jesus went off to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples . A large crowd from Galilee followed .
NIRV	Mark	3	8	People heard about all that Jesus was doing . And many came to him . They came from Judea , Jerusalem and Idumea . They came from the lands east of the Jordan River . And they came from the area around Tyre and Sidon .
NIRV	Mark	3	9	Because of the crowd , Jesus told his disciples to get a small boat ready for him . This would keep the people from crowding him .
NIRV	Mark	3	10	Jesus had healed many people . So those who were sick were pushing forward to touch him .
NIRV	Mark	3	11	When people controlled by evil spirits saw him , they fell down in front of him . The spirits shouted , “ You are the Son of God ! ”
NIRV	Mark	3	12	disciples . Simon was one of them . Jesus gave him the name Peter .
NIRV	Mark	3	13	Jesus went up on a mountainside . He called for certain people to come to him , and they came .
NIRV	Mark	3	14	He appointed
NIRV	Mark	3	15	And he gave them authority to drive out demons .
NIRV	Mark	3	16	So Jesus appointed the
NIRV	Mark	3	17	There were James , son of Zebedee , and his brother John . Jesus gave them the name Boanerges . Boanerges means Sons of Thunder .
NIRV	Mark	3	18	There were also Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , and James , son of Alphaeus . And there were Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot .
NIRV	Mark	3	19	Judas Iscariot was one of them too . He was the one who was later going to hand Jesus over to his enemies . Jesus Is Accused by Teachers of the Law
NIRV	Mark	3	20	Jesus entered a house . Again a crowd gathered . It was so large that Jesus and his disciples were not even able to eat .
NIRV	Mark	3	21	His family heard about this . So they went to take charge of him . They said , “ He is out of his mind. ”
NIRV	Mark	3	22	Some teachers of the law were there . They had come down from Jerusalem . They said , “ He is controlled by Beelzebul ! He is driving out demons by the power of the prince of demons. ”
NIRV	Mark	3	23	So Jesus called them over to him . He began to speak to them using stories . He said , “ How can Satan drive out Satan ?
NIRV	Mark	3	24	If a kingdom fights against itself , it can ’ t stand .
NIRV	Mark	3	25	If a family is divided , it can ’ t stand .
NIRV	Mark	3	26	And if Satan fights against himself , and his helpers are divided , he can ’ t stand . That is the end of him .
NIRV	Mark	3	27	In fact , none of you can enter a strong man ’ s house unless you tie him up first . Then you can steal things from his house .
NIRV	Mark	3	28	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . Everyone ’ s sins and evil words against God will be forgiven .
NIRV	Mark	3	29	But whoever speaks evil things against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven . Their guilt will last forever. ”
NIRV	Mark	3	30	Jesus said this because the teachers of the law were saying , “ He has an evil spirit. ” Jesus ’ Mother and Brothers
NIRV	Mark	3	31	Jesus ’ mother and brothers came and stood outside . They sent someone in to get him .
NIRV	Mark	3	32	A crowd was sitting around Jesus . They told him , “ Your mother and your brothers are outside . They are looking for you. ”
NIRV	Mark	3	33	“ Who is my mother ? Who are my brothers ? ” he asked .
NIRV	Mark	3	34	Then Jesus looked at the people sitting in a circle around him . He said , “ Here is my mother ! Here are my brothers !
NIRV	Mark	3	35	Anyone who does what God wants is my brother or sister or mother. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Mark	4	4	He scattered the seed on the ground . Some fell on a path . Birds came and ate it up .
NIRV	Mark	4	2	He taught them many things using stories . In his teaching he said ,
NIRV	Mark	4	3	“ Listen ! A farmer went out to plant his seed .
NIRV	Mark	4	5	Some seed fell on rocky places , where there wasn ’ t much soil . The plants came up quickly , because the soil wasn ’ t deep .
NIRV	Mark	4	6	When the sun came up , it burned the plants . They dried up because they had no roots .
NIRV	Mark	4	7	Other seed fell among thorns . The thorns grew up and crowded out the plants . So the plants did not bear grain .
NIRV	Mark	4	8	Still other seed fell on good soil . It grew up and produced a crop
NIRV	Mark	4	30	Again Jesus said , “ What can we say God ’ s kingdom is like ? What story can we use to explain it ?
NIRV	Mark	4	60	, or even
NIRV	Mark	4	100	times more than the farmer planted. ” A Lamp on a Stand
NIRV	Mark	4	9	Then Jesus said , “ Whoever has ears should listen. ”
NIRV	Mark	4	10	Later Jesus was alone . The
NIRV	Mark	4	12	In that way , “ ‘ They will see but never know what they are seeing . They will hear but never understand . Otherwise they might turn and be forgiven ! ’ ” ( Isaiah 6:9,10 )
NIRV	Mark	4	11	He told them , “ The secret of God ’ s kingdom has been given to you . But to outsiders everything is told using stories .
NIRV	Mark	4	13	Then Jesus said to them , “ Don ’ t you understand this story ? Then how will you understand any stories of this kind ?
NIRV	Mark	4	14	The seed the farmer plants is God ’ s message .
NIRV	Mark	4	15	What is seed scattered on a path like ? The message is planted . The people hear the message . Then Satan comes . He takes away the message that was planted in them .
NIRV	Mark	4	16	And what is seed scattered on rocky places like ? The people hear the message . At once they receive it with joy .
NIRV	Mark	4	17	But they have no roots . So they last only a short time . They quickly fall away from the faith when trouble or suffering comes because of the message .
NIRV	Mark	4	18	And what is seed scattered among thorns like ? The people hear the message .
NIRV	Mark	4	19	But then the worries of this life come to them . Wealth comes with its false promises . The people also long for other things . All of these are the kinds of things that crowd out the message . They keep it from producing fruit .
NIRV	Mark	4	20	And what is seed scattered on good soil like ? The people hear the message . They accept it . They produce a good crop
NIRV	Mark	4	21	Jesus said to them , “ Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a large bowl or a bed ? Don ’ t you put it on its stand ?
NIRV	Mark	4	22	What is hidden is meant to be seen . And what is put out of sight is meant to be brought out into the open .
NIRV	Mark	4	23	Whoever has ears should listen. ”
NIRV	Mark	4	24	“ Think carefully about what you hear , ” he said . “ As you give , so you will receive . In fact , you will receive even more .
NIRV	Mark	4	25	Whoever has something will be given more . Whoever has nothing , even what they have will be taken away from them. ” The Story of the Growing Seed
NIRV	Mark	4	26	Jesus also said , “ Here is what God ’ s kingdom is like . A farmer scatters seed on the ground .
NIRV	Mark	4	27	Night and day the seed comes up and grows . It happens whether the farmer sleeps or gets up . He doesn ’ t know how it happens .
NIRV	Mark	4	28	All by itself the soil produces grain . First the stalk comes up . Then the head appears . Finally , the full grain appears in the head .
NIRV	Mark	4	29	Before long the grain ripens . So the farmer cuts it down , because the harvest is ready. ” The Story of the Mustard Seed
NIRV	Mark	4	31	It is like a mustard seed , which is the smallest of all seeds on earth .
NIRV	Mark	4	32	But when you plant the seed , it grows . It becomes the largest of all garden plants . Its branches are so big that birds can rest in its shade. ”
NIRV	Mark	4	33	Using many stories like these , Jesus spoke the word to them . He told them as much as they could understand .
NIRV	Mark	4	34	He did not say anything to them without using a story . But when he was alone with his disciples , he explained everything . Jesus Calms the Storm
NIRV	Mark	4	35	When evening came , Jesus said to his disciples , “ Let ’ s go over to the other side of the lake. ”
NIRV	Mark	4	36	They left the crowd behind . And they took him along in a boat , just as he was . There were also other boats with him .
NIRV	Mark	4	37	A wild storm came up . Waves crashed over the boat . It was about to sink .
NIRV	Mark	4	38	Jesus was in the back , sleeping on a cushion . The disciples woke him up . They said , “ Teacher ! Don ’ t you care if we drown ? ”
NIRV	Mark	4	39	He got up and ordered the wind to stop . He said to the waves , “ Quiet ! Be still ! ” Then the wind died down . And it was completely calm .
NIRV	Mark	4	40	He said to his disciples , “ Why are you so afraid ? Don ’ t you have any faith at all yet ? ”
NIRV	Mark	4	41	They were terrified . They asked each other , “ Who is this ? Even the wind and the waves obey him ! ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Mark	5	5	Night and day he screamed among the tombs and in the hills . He cut himself with stones .
NIRV	Mark	5	2	Jesus got out of the boat . A man controlled by an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him .
NIRV	Mark	5	3	The man lived in the tombs . No one could keep him tied up anymore . Not even a chain could hold him .
NIRV	Mark	5	4	His hands and feet had often been chained . But he tore the chains apart . And he broke the iron cuffs on his ankles . No one was strong enough to control him .
NIRV	Mark	5	6	When he saw Jesus a long way off , he ran to him . He fell on his knees in front of him .
NIRV	Mark	5	7	He shouted at the top of his voice , “ Jesus , Son of the Most High God , what do you want with me ? Swear to God that you won ’ t hurt me ! ”
NIRV	Mark	5	8	This was because Jesus had said to him , “ Come out of this man , you evil spirit ! ”
NIRV	Mark	5	9	Then Jesus asked the demon , “ What is your name ? ” “ My name is Legion , ” he replied . “ There are many of us. ”
NIRV	Mark	5	10	And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area .
NIRV	Mark	5	11	A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside .
NIRV	Mark	5	12	years old . Right away she stood up and began to walk around . They were totally amazed at this .
NIRV	Mark	5	13	Jesus allowed it . The evil spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs . There were about 2,000 pigs in the herd . The whole herd rushed down the steep bank . They ran into the lake and drowned .
NIRV	Mark	5	14	Those who were tending the pigs ran off . They told the people in the town and countryside what had happened . The people went out to see for themselves .
NIRV	Mark	5	15	Then they came to Jesus . They saw the man who had been controlled by many demons . He was sitting there . He was now dressed and thinking clearly . All this made the people afraid .
NIRV	Mark	5	16	Those who had seen it told them what had happened to the man . They told about the pigs as well .
NIRV	Mark	5	17	Then the people began to beg Jesus to leave their area .
NIRV	Mark	5	18	Jesus was getting into the boat . The man who had been controlled by demons begged to go with him .
NIRV	Mark	5	19	Jesus did not let him . He said , “ Go home to your own people . Tell them how much the Lord has done for you . Tell them how kind he has been to you. ”
NIRV	Mark	5	20	So the man went away . In the area known as the Ten Cities , he began to tell how much Jesus had done for him . And all the people were amazed . Jesus Heals a Dead Girl and a Suffering Woman
NIRV	Mark	5	21	Jesus went across the Sea of Galilee in a boat . It landed at the other side . There a large crowd gathered around him .
NIRV	Mark	5	22	Then a man named Jairus came . He was a synagogue leader . When he saw Jesus , he fell at his feet .
NIRV	Mark	5	23	He begged Jesus , “ Please come . My little daughter is dying . Place your hands on her to heal her . Then she will live. ”
NIRV	Mark	5	24	So Jesus went with him . A large group of people followed . They crowded around him .
NIRV	Mark	5	25	A woman was there who had a sickness that made her bleed . It had lasted for
NIRV	Mark	5	26	She had suffered a great deal , even though she had gone to many doctors . She had spent all the money she had . But she was getting worse , not better .
NIRV	Mark	5	27	Then she heard about Jesus . She came up behind him in the crowd and touched his clothes .
NIRV	Mark	5	28	She thought , “ I just need to touch his clothes . Then I will be healed. ”
NIRV	Mark	5	29	Right away her bleeding stopped . She felt in her body that her suffering was over .
NIRV	Mark	5	30	At once Jesus knew that power had gone out from him . He turned around in the crowd . He asked , “ Who touched my clothes ? ”
NIRV	Mark	5	31	“ You see the people , ” his disciples answered . “ They are crowding against you . And you still ask , ‘ Who touched me ? ’ ”
NIRV	Mark	5	32	But Jesus kept looking around . He wanted to see who had touched him .
NIRV	Mark	5	33	Then the woman came and fell at his feet . She knew what had happened to her . She was shaking with fear . But she told him the whole truth .
NIRV	Mark	5	34	He said to her , “ Dear woman , your faith has healed you . Go in peace . You are free from your suffering. ”
NIRV	Mark	5	35	While Jesus was still speaking , some people came from the house of Jairus . He was the synagogue leader . “ Your daughter is dead , ” they said . “ Why bother the teacher anymore ? ”
NIRV	Mark	5	36	Jesus heard what they were saying . He told the synagogue leader , “ Don ’ t be afraid . Just believe. ”
NIRV	Mark	5	37	He let only Peter , James , and John , the brother of James , follow him .
NIRV	Mark	5	38	They came to the home of the synagogue leader . There Jesus saw a lot of confusion . People were crying and sobbing loudly .
NIRV	Mark	5	39	He went inside . Then he said to them , “ Why all this confusion and sobbing ? The child is not dead . She is only sleeping. ”
NIRV	Mark	5	40	But they laughed at him . He made them all go outside . He took only the child ’ s father and mother and the disciples who were with him . And he went in where the child was .
NIRV	Mark	5	41	He took her by the hand . Then he said to her , “ Talitha koum ! ” This means , “ Little girl , I say to you , get up ! ”

NIRV	Mark	6	6	He was amazed because they had no faith . Jesus Sends Out the Twelve Disciples Jesus went around teaching from village to village .
NIRV	Mark	6	2	When the Sabbath day came , he began to teach in the synagogue . Many who heard him were amazed . “ Where did this man get these things ? ” they asked . “ What ’ s this wisdom that has been given to him ? What are these remarkable miracles he is doing ?
NIRV	Mark	6	3	Isn ’ t this the carpenter ? Isn ’ t this Mary ’ s son ? Isn ’ t this the brother of James , Joseph , Judas and Simon ? Aren ’ t his sisters here with us ? ” They were not pleased with him at all .
NIRV	Mark	6	4	Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own town . He doesn ’ t receive any honor among his relatives or in his own home. ”
NIRV	Mark	6	5	Jesus placed his hands on a few sick people and healed them . But he could not do any other miracles there .
NIRV	Mark	6	7	He called the
NIRV	Mark	6	12	baskets of broken pieces of bread and fish .
NIRV	Mark	6	8	Here is what he told them to do . “ Take only a walking stick for your trip . Do not take bread or a bag . Take no money in your belts .
NIRV	Mark	6	9	Wear sandals . But do not take extra clothes .
NIRV	Mark	6	10	When you are invited into a house , stay there until you leave town .
NIRV	Mark	6	11	Some places may not welcome you or listen to you . If they don ’ t , leave that place and shake the dust off your feet . That will be a witness against the people living there. ”
NIRV	Mark	6	13	They drove out many demons . They poured olive oil on many sick people and healed them . John the Baptist ’ s Head Is Cut Off
NIRV	Mark	6	14	King Herod heard about this . Jesus ’ name had become well known . Some were saying , “ John the Baptist has been raised from the dead ! That is why he has the power to do miracles. ”
NIRV	Mark	6	15	Others said , “ He is Elijah. ” Still others claimed , “ He is a prophet . He is like one of the prophets of long ago. ”
NIRV	Mark	6	16	But when Herod heard this , he said , “ I had John ’ s head cut off . And now he has been raised from the dead ! ”
NIRV	Mark	6	17	In fact , it was Herod himself who had given orders to arrest John . He had him tied up and put in prison . He did this because of Herodias . She was the wife of Herod ’ s brother Philip . But now Herod was married to her .
NIRV	Mark	6	18	John had been saying to Herod , “ It is against the Law for you to be married to your brother ’ s wife. ”
NIRV	Mark	6	19	Herodias couldn ’ t forgive John for saying that . She wanted to kill him . But she could not ,
NIRV	Mark	6	20	because Herod was afraid of John . So he kept John safe . Herod knew John was a holy man who did what was right . When Herod heard him , he was very puzzled . But he liked to listen to John .
NIRV	Mark	6	21	Finally the right time came . Herod gave a banquet on his birthday . He invited his high officials and military leaders . He also invited the most important men in Galilee .
NIRV	Mark	6	22	Then the daughter of Herodias came in and danced . She pleased Herod and his dinner guests . The king said to the girl , “ Ask me for anything you want . I ’ ll give it to you. ”
NIRV	Mark	6	23	And he gave her his promise . He said to her , “ Anything you ask for I will give you . I ’ ll give you up to half my kingdom. ”
NIRV	Mark	6	24	She went out and said to her mother , “ What should I ask for ? ” “ The head of John the Baptist , ” she answered .
NIRV	Mark	6	25	At once the girl hurried to ask the king . She said , “ I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a big plate right now. ”
NIRV	Mark	6	26	The king was very upset . But he thought about his promise and his dinner guests . So he did not want to say no to the girl .
NIRV	Mark	6	27	He sent a man right away to bring John ’ s head . The man went to the prison and cut off John ’ s head .
NIRV	Mark	6	28	He brought it back on a big plate . He gave it to the girl , and she gave it to her mother .
NIRV	Mark	6	29	John ’ s disciples heard about this . So they came and took his body . Then they placed it in a tomb . Jesus Feeds Five Thousand
NIRV	Mark	6	30	The apostles gathered around Jesus . They told him all they had done and taught .
NIRV	Mark	6	31	But many people were coming and going . So they did not even have a chance to eat . Then Jesus said to his apostles , “ Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place . You need to get some rest. ”
NIRV	Mark	6	32	So they went away by themselves in a boat to a quiet place .
NIRV	Mark	6	33	But many people who saw them leaving recognized them . They ran from all the towns and got there ahead of them .
NIRV	Mark	6	34	When Jesus came ashore , he saw a large crowd . He felt deep concern for them . They were like sheep without a shepherd . So he began teaching them many things .
NIRV	Mark	6	35	By that time it was late in the day . His disciples came to him . “ There is nothing here , ” they said . “ It ’ s already very late .
NIRV	Mark	6	36	Send the people away . Then they can go to the nearby countryside and villages to buy something to eat. ”
NIRV	Mark	6	37	But Jesus answered , “ You give them something to eat. ” They said to him , “ That would take more than half a year ’ s pay ! Should we go and spend that much on bread ? Are we supposed to feed them ? ”
NIRV	Mark	6	38	“ How many loaves do you have ? ” Jesus asked . “ Go and see. ” When they found out , they said , “ Five loaves and two fish. ”
NIRV	Mark	6	39	Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass .
NIRV	Mark	6	40	So they sat down in groups of 100s and 50s .
NIRV	Mark	6	41	Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish . He looked up to heaven and gave thanks . He broke the loaves into pieces . Then he gave them to his disciples to pass around to the people . He also divided the two fish among them all .
NIRV	Mark	6	42	All of them ate and were satisfied .
NIRV	Mark	6	43	The disciples picked up
NIRV	Mark	6	44	The number of men who had eaten was 5,000 . Jesus Walks on the Water
NIRV	Mark	6	45	Right away Jesus made his disciples get into the boat . He had them go on ahead of him to Bethsaida . Then he sent the crowd away .
NIRV	Mark	6	46	After leaving them , he went up on a mountainside to pray .
NIRV	Mark	6	47	Later that night , the boat was in the middle of the Sea of Galilee . Jesus was alone on land .
NIRV	Mark	6	48	He saw the disciples pulling hard on the oars . The wind was blowing against them . Shortly before dawn , he went out to them . He walked on the lake . When he was about to pass by them ,
NIRV	Mark	6	49	they saw him walking on the lake . They thought he was a ghost , so they cried out .
NIRV	Mark	6	50	They all saw him and were terrified . Right away Jesus said to them , “ Be brave ! It is I. Don ’ t be afraid. ”
NIRV	Mark	6	51	Then he climbed into the boat with them . The wind died down . And they were completely amazed .
NIRV	Mark	6	52	They had not understood about the loaves . They were stubborn .
NIRV	Mark	6	53	They went across the lake and landed at Gennesaret . There they tied up the boat .
NIRV	Mark	6	54	As soon as Jesus and his disciples got out , people recognized him .
NIRV	Mark	6	55	They ran through that whole area to bring to him those who were sick . They carried them on mats to where they heard he was .
NIRV	Mark	6	56	He went into the villages , the towns and the countryside . Everywhere he went , the people brought the sick to the market areas . Those who were sick begged him to let them touch just the edge of his clothes . And all who touched his clothes were healed . Copyright ©

NIRV	Mark	7	7	Their worship doesn ’ t mean anything to me . They teach nothing but human rules. ’ ( Isaiah 29:13 )
NIRV	Mark	7	2	They saw some of his disciples eating food with “ unclean ” hands . That means they were not washed .
NIRV	Mark	7	3	The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands to make them “ clean. ” That ’ s what the elders teach .
NIRV	Mark	7	4	When they come from the market , they do not eat unless they wash. And they follow many other teachings . For example , they wash cups , pitchers , and kettles in a special way .
NIRV	Mark	7	5	So the Pharisees and the teachers of the law questioned Jesus . “ Why don ’ t your disciples live by what the elders teach ? ” they asked . “ Why do they eat their food with ‘ unclean ’ hands ? ”
NIRV	Mark	7	6	He replied , “ Isaiah was right . He prophesied about you people who pretend to be good . He said , “ ‘ These people honor me by what they say . But their hearts are far away from me .
NIRV	Mark	7	8	You have let go of God ’ s commands . And you are holding on to teachings that people have made up. ”
NIRV	Mark	7	9	Jesus continued speaking , “ You have a fine way of setting aside God ’ s commands ! You do this so you can follow your own teachings .
NIRV	Mark	7	10	Moses said , ‘ Honor your father and mother. ’ ( Exodus 20:12 ; Deuteronomy 5:16 ) He also said , ‘ Anyone who asks for bad things to happen to their father or mother must be put to death. ’ ( Exodus 21:17 ; Leviticus 20:9 )
NIRV	Mark	7	11	But you allow people to say that what might have been used to help their parents is Corban . Corban means A Gift Set Apart for God .
NIRV	Mark	7	12	So you no longer let them do anything for their parents .
NIRV	Mark	7	13	You make the word of God useless by putting your own teachings in its place . And you do many things like this. ”
NIRV	Mark	7	14	Again Jesus called the crowd to him . He said , “ Listen to me , everyone . Understand this . 15-16 Nothing outside of a person can make them ‘ unclean ’ by going into them . It is what comes out of them that makes them ‘ unclean. ’ ”
NIRV	Mark	7	17	Then he left the crowd and entered the house . His disciples asked him about this teaching .
NIRV	Mark	7	18	“ Don ’ t you understand ? ” Jesus asked . “ Don ’ t you see ? Nothing that enters a person from the outside can make them ‘ unclean. ’
NIRV	Mark	7	19	It doesn ’ t go into their heart . It goes into their stomach . Then it goes out of the body. ” In saying this , Jesus was calling all foods “ clean. ”
NIRV	Mark	7	20	He went on to say , “ What comes out of a person is what makes them ‘ unclean. ’
NIRV	Mark	7	21	Evil thoughts come from the inside , from a person ’ s heart . So do sexual sins , stealing and murder .
NIRV	Mark	7	22	Adultery , greed , hate and cheating come from a person ’ s heart too . So do desires that are not pure , and wanting what belongs to others . And so do telling lies about others and being proud and being foolish .
NIRV	Mark	7	23	All these evil things come from inside a person and make them ‘ unclean. ’ ” Jesus Honors a Greek Woman ’ s Faith
NIRV	Mark	7	24	Jesus went from there to a place near Tyre . He entered a house . He did not want anyone to know where he was . But he could not keep it a secret .
NIRV	Mark	7	25	Soon a woman heard about him . An evil spirit controlled her little daughter . The woman came to Jesus and fell at his feet .
NIRV	Mark	7	26	She was a Greek , born in Syrian Phoenicia . She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter .
NIRV	Mark	7	27	“ First let the children eat all they want , ” he told her . “ It is not right to take the children ’ s bread and throw it to the dogs. ”
NIRV	Mark	7	28	“ Lord , ” she replied , “ even the dogs under the table eat the children ’ s crumbs. ”
NIRV	Mark	7	29	Then he told her , “ That was a good reply . You may go . The demon has left your daughter. ”
NIRV	Mark	7	30	So she went home and found her child lying on the bed . And the demon was gone . Jesus Heals a Man Who Could Not Hear or Speak
NIRV	Mark	7	31	Then Jesus left the area of Tyre and went through Sidon . He went down to the Sea of Galilee and into the area known as the Ten Cities .
NIRV	Mark	7	32	There some people brought a man to Jesus . The man was deaf and could hardly speak . They begged Jesus to place his hand on the man .
NIRV	Mark	7	33	Jesus took the man to one side , away from the crowd . He put his fingers into the man ’ s ears . Then he spit and touched the man ’ s tongue .
NIRV	Mark	7	34	Jesus looked up to heaven . With a deep sigh , he said to the man , “ Ephphatha ! ” That means “ Be opened ! ”
NIRV	Mark	7	35	The man ’ s ears were opened . His tongue was freed up , and he began to speak clearly .
NIRV	Mark	7	36	Jesus ordered the people not to tell anyone . But the more he did so , the more they kept talking about it .
NIRV	Mark	7	37	People were really amazed . “ He has done everything well , ” they said . “ He even makes deaf people able to hear . And he makes those who can ’ t speak able to talk. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Mark	8	4	His disciples answered him . “ There is nothing here , ” they said . “ Where can anyone get enough bread to feed them ? ”

NIRV	Mark	8	11	The Pharisees came and began to ask Jesus questions . They wanted to test him . So they asked him for a sign from heaven .
NIRV	Mark	8	12	He sighed deeply . He said , “ Why do you people ask for a sign ? What I ’ m about to tell you is true . No sign will be given to you. ”
NIRV	Mark	8	13	Then he left them . He got back into the boat and crossed to the other side of the lake . The Yeast of the Pharisees and Herod
NIRV	Mark	8	14	The disciples had forgotten to bring bread . They had only one loaf with them in the boat .
NIRV	Mark	8	15	“ Be careful , ” Jesus warned them . “ Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees . And watch out for the yeast of Herod. ”
NIRV	Mark	8	16	They talked about this with each other . They said , “ He must be saying this because we don ’ t have any bread. ”
NIRV	Mark	8	17	Jesus knew what they were saying . So he asked them , “ Why are you talking about having no bread ? Why can ’ t you see or understand ? Are you stubborn ?
NIRV	Mark	8	18	Do you have eyes and still don ’ t see ? Do you have ears and still don ’ t hear ? And don ’ t you remember ?
NIRV	Mark	8	19	Earlier I broke five loaves for the 5,000 . How many baskets of pieces did you pick up ? ” “ Twelve , ” they replied .
NIRV	Mark	8	20	“ Later I broke seven loaves for the 4,000 . How many baskets of pieces did you pick up ? ” “ Seven , ” they answered .
NIRV	Mark	8	21	He said to them , “ Can ’ t you understand yet ? ” Jesus Heals a Blind Man at Bethsaida
NIRV	Mark	8	22	Jesus and his disciples came to Bethsaida . Some people brought a blind man to him . They begged Jesus to touch him .
NIRV	Mark	8	23	He took the blind man by the hand . Then he led him outside the village . He spit on the man ’ s eyes and placed his hands on him . “ Do you see anything ? ” Jesus asked .
NIRV	Mark	8	24	The man looked up . He said , “ I see people . They look like trees walking around. ”
NIRV	Mark	8	25	Once more Jesus put his hands on the man ’ s eyes . Then his eyes were opened so that he could see again . He saw everything clearly .

NIRV	Mark	8	31	Jesus then began to teach his disciples . He taught them that the Son of Man must suffer many things . He taught them that the elders would not accept him . The chief priests and the teachers of the law would not accept him either . He must be killed and after three days rise again .
NIRV	Mark	8	32	He spoke clearly about this . Peter took Jesus to one side and began to scold him .
NIRV	Mark	8	33	Jesus turned and looked at his disciples . He scolded Peter . “ Get behind me , Satan ! ” he said . “ You are not thinking about the things God cares about . Instead , you are thinking only about the things humans care about. ” You Must Pick Up Your Cross
NIRV	Mark	8	34	Jesus called the crowd to him along with his disciples . He said , “ Whoever wants to be my disciple must say no to themselves . They must pick up their cross and follow me .
NIRV	Mark	8	35	Whoever wants to save their life will lose it . But whoever loses their life for me and for the good news will save it .

NIRV	Mark	9	3	His clothes became so white they shone . They were whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them .
NIRV	Mark	9	4	Elijah and Moses appeared in front of Jesus and his disciples . The two of them were talking with Jesus .
NIRV	Mark	9	5	Peter said to Jesus , “ Rabbi , it is good for us to be here . Let us put up three shelters . One will be for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah. ”
NIRV	Mark	9	6	Peter didn ’ t really know what to say , because they were so afraid .
NIRV	Mark	9	7	Then a cloud appeared and covered them . A voice came from the cloud . It said , “ This is my Son , and I love him . Listen to him ! ”
NIRV	Mark	9	8	They looked around . Suddenly they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus .
NIRV	Mark	9	10	So they kept the matter to themselves . But they asked each other what “ rising from the dead ” meant .

NIRV	Mark	9	17	A man in the crowd answered . “ Teacher , ” he said , “ I brought you my son . He is controlled by an evil spirit . Because of this , my son can ’ t speak anymore .
NIRV	Mark	9	18	When the spirit takes hold of him , it throws him to the ground . He foams at the mouth . He grinds his teeth . And his body becomes stiff . I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit . But they couldn ’ t do it. ”
NIRV	Mark	9	19	“ You unbelieving people ! ” Jesus replied . “ How long do I have to stay with you ? How long do I have to put up with you ? Bring the boy to me. ”
NIRV	Mark	9	20	So they brought him . As soon as the spirit saw Jesus , it threw the boy into a fit . He fell to the ground . He rolled around and foamed at the mouth .
NIRV	Mark	9	21	Jesus asked the boy ’ s father , “ How long has he been like this ? ” “ Since he was a child , ” he answered .

NIRV	Mark	9	42	“ What if someone leads one of these little ones who believe in me to sin ? If they do , it would be better if a large millstone were hung around their neck and they were thrown into the sea . 43-44 If your hand causes you to sin , cut it off . It would be better for you to enter God ’ s kingdom with only one hand than to go into hell with two hands . In hell the fire never goes out . 45-46 If your foot causes you to sin , cut it off . It would be better to enter God ’ s kingdom with only one foot than to have two feet and be thrown into hell .

NIRV	Mark	10	2	Some Pharisees came to test Jesus . They asked , “ Does the Law allow a man to divorce his wife ? ”
NIRV	Mark	10	3	“ What did Moses command you ? ” he replied .
NIRV	Mark	10	4	They said , “ Moses allowed a man to write a letter of divorce and send her away. ”
NIRV	Mark	10	5	“ You were stubborn . That ’ s why Moses wrote you this law , ” Jesus replied .
NIRV	Mark	10	6	“ But at the beginning of creation , God ‘ made them male and female. ’ ( Genesis 1:27 )
NIRV	Mark	10	7	‘ That ’ s why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife .
NIRV	Mark	10	8	The two of them will become one. ’ ( Genesis 2:24 ) They are no longer two , but one .

NIRV	Mark	10	20	“ Teacher , ” he said , “ I have obeyed all those commandments since I was a boy. ”
NIRV	Mark	10	21	Jesus looked at him and loved him . “ You are missing one thing , ” he said . “ Go and sell everything you have . Give the money to those who are poor . You will have treasure in heaven . Then come and follow me. ”
NIRV	Mark	10	22	The man ’ s face fell . He went away sad , because he was very rich .
NIRV	Mark	10	23	Jesus looked around . He said to his disciples , “ How hard it is for rich people to enter God ’ s kingdom ! ”
NIRV	Mark	10	24	The disciples were amazed at his words . But Jesus said again , “ Children , how hard it is to enter God ’ s kingdom !

NIRV	Mark	10	27	Jesus looked at them and said , “ With people , this is impossible . But not with God . All things are possible with God. ”
NIRV	Mark	10	28	Then Peter spoke up , “ We have left everything to follow you ! ”
NIRV	Mark	10	29	“ What I ’ m about to tell you is true , ” Jesus replied . “ Has anyone left home or family or fields for me and the good news ?
NIRV	Mark	10	30	They will receive
NIRV	Mark	10	100	times as much in this world . They will have homes and families and fields . But they will also be treated badly by others . In the world to come they will live forever .

NIRV	Mark	10	38	“ You don ’ t know what you ’ re asking for , ” Jesus said . “ Can you drink the cup of suffering I drink ? Or can you go through the baptism of suffering I must go through ? ”
NIRV	Mark	10	39	“ We can , ” they answered . Jesus said to them , “ You will drink the cup I drink . And you will go through the baptism I go through .
NIRV	Mark	10	40	But it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or left hand . These places belong to those they are prepared for. ”
NIRV	Mark	10	41	The other ten disciples heard about it . They became angry at James and John .
NIRV	Mark	10	42	Jesus called them together . He said , “ You know about those who are rulers of the Gentiles . They hold power over their people . Their high officials order them around .
NIRV	Mark	10	43	Don ’ t be like that . Instead , anyone who wants to be important among you must be your servant .
NIRV	Mark	10	44	And anyone who wants to be first must be the slave of everyone .

NIRV	Mark	11	29	Jesus replied , “ I will ask you one question . Answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things .
NIRV	Mark	11	30	Was John ’ s baptism from heaven ? Or did it come from human authority ? Tell me ! ”
NIRV	Mark	11	31	They talked to each other about it . They said , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ he will ask , ‘ Then why didn ’ t you believe him ? ’
NIRV	Mark	11	32	But what if we say , ‘ From human authority ’ ? ” They were afraid of the people . Everyone believed that John really was a prophet .
NIRV	Mark	11	33	So they answered Jesus , “ We don ’ t know. ” Jesus said , “ Then I won ’ t tell you by what authority I am doing these things either. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Mark	12	2	At harvest time he sent a servant to the renters . He told the servant to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard .
NIRV	Mark	12	3	But they grabbed the servant and beat him up . Then they sent him away with nothing .
NIRV	Mark	12	4	So the man sent another servant to the renters . They hit this one on the head and treated him badly .
NIRV	Mark	12	5	The man sent still another servant . The renters killed him . The man sent many others . The renters beat up some of them . They killed the others .
NIRV	Mark	12	6	“ The man had one person left to send . It was his son , and he loved him . He sent him last of all . He said , ‘ They will respect my son. ’
NIRV	Mark	12	7	“ But the renters said to each other , ‘ This is the one who will receive all the owner ’ s property someday . Come , let ’ s kill him . Then everything will be ours. ’
NIRV	Mark	12	8	So they took him and killed him . They threw him out of the vineyard .
NIRV	Mark	12	9	“ What will the owner of the vineyard do then ? He will come and kill those renters . He will give the vineyard to others .
NIRV	Mark	12	10	Haven ’ t you read what this part of Scripture says , “ ‘ The stone the builders didn ’ t accept has become the most important stone of all .
NIRV	Mark	12	11	The Lord has done it . It is wonderful in our eyes ’ ? ” ( Psalm 118:22,23 )
NIRV	Mark	12	13	Later the religious leaders sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus . They wanted to trap him with his own words .
NIRV	Mark	12	14	They came to him and said , “ Teacher , we know that you are a man of honor . You don ’ t let other people tell you what to do or say . You don ’ t care how important they are . But you teach the way of God truthfully . Is it right to pay the royal tax to Caesar or not ?
NIRV	Mark	12	15	Should we pay or shouldn ’ t we ? ” But Jesus knew what they were trying to do . So he asked , “ Why are you trying to trap me ? Bring me a silver coin . Let me look at it. ”
NIRV	Mark	12	16	They brought the coin . He asked them , “ Whose picture is this ? And whose words ? ” “ Caesar ’ s , ” they replied .
NIRV	Mark	12	17	Then Jesus said to them , “ Give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar . And give back to God what belongs to God. ” They were amazed at him . Marriage When the Dead Rise
NIRV	Mark	12	18	The Sadducees came to Jesus with a question . They do not believe that people rise from the dead .
NIRV	Mark	12	19	“ Teacher , ” they said , “ Moses wrote for us about a man who died and didn ’ t have any children . But he did leave a wife behind . That man ’ s brother must get married to the widow . He must provide children to carry on his dead brother ’ s name .
NIRV	Mark	12	20	There were seven brothers . The first one got married . He died without leaving any children .
NIRV	Mark	12	21	The second one got married to the widow . He also died and left no child . It was the same with the third one .
NIRV	Mark	12	22	In fact , none of the seven left any children . Last of all , the woman died too .
NIRV	Mark	12	23	When the dead rise , whose wife will she be ? All seven of them were married to her. ”
NIRV	Mark	12	24	Jesus replied , “ You are mistaken because you do not know the Scriptures . And you do not know the power of God .
NIRV	Mark	12	25	When the dead rise , they won ’ t get married . And their parents won ’ t give them to be married . They will be like the angels in heaven .
NIRV	Mark	12	26	What about the dead rising ? Haven ’ t you read in the Book of Moses the story of the burning bush ? God said to Moses , ‘ I am the God of Abraham . I am the God of Isaac . And I am the God of Jacob. ’ ( Exodus 3:6 )
NIRV	Mark	12	27	He is not the God of the dead . He is the God of the living . You have made a big mistake ! ” The Most Important Commandment
NIRV	Mark	12	28	One of the teachers of the law came and heard the Sadducees arguing . He noticed that Jesus had given the Sadducees a good answer . So he asked him , “ Which is the most important of all the commandments ? ”
NIRV	Mark	12	29	Jesus answered , “ Here is the most important one . Moses said , ‘ Israel , listen to me . The Lord is our God . The Lord is one .
NIRV	Mark	12	30	Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul . Love him with all your mind and with all your strength. ’ ( Deuteronomy 6:4,5 )
NIRV	Mark	12	31	And here is the second one . ‘ Love your neighbor as you love yourself. ’ ( Leviticus 19:18 ) There is no commandment more important than these. ”
NIRV	Mark	12	32	“ You have spoken well , teacher , ” the man replied . “ You are right in saying that God is one . There is no other God but him .
NIRV	Mark	12	33	To love God with all your heart and mind and strength is very important . So is loving your neighbor as you love yourself . These things are more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices. ”
NIRV	Mark	12	34	Jesus saw that the man had answered wisely . He said to him , “ You are not far from God ’ s kingdom. ” From then on , no one dared to ask Jesus any more questions . Whose Son Is the Messiah ?
NIRV	Mark	12	35	Jesus was teaching in the temple courtyard . He asked , “ Why do the teachers of the law say that the Messiah is the son of David ?
NIRV	Mark	12	36	The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself . David said , “ ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your control. ” ’ ( Psalm 110:1 )
NIRV	Mark	12	37	David himself calls him ‘ Lord. ’ So how can he be David ’ s son ? ” The large crowd listened to Jesus with delight . Warning Against the Teachers of the Law
NIRV	Mark	12	38	As he taught , he said , “ Watch out for the teachers of the law . They like to walk around in long robes . They like to be greeted with respect in the market .
NIRV	Mark	12	39	They love to have the most important seats in the synagogues . They also love to have the places of honor at dinners .
NIRV	Mark	12	40	They take over the houses of widows . They say long prayers to show off . God will punish these men very much. ” The Widow ’ s Offering
NIRV	Mark	12	41	Jesus sat down across from the place where people put their temple offerings . He watched the crowd putting their money into the offering boxes . Many rich people threw large amounts into them .
NIRV	Mark	12	42	But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins . They were worth only a few pennies .
NIRV	Mark	12	43	Jesus asked his disciples to come to him . He said , “ What I ’ m about to tell you is true . That poor widow has put more into the offering box than all the others .
NIRV	Mark	12	44	They all gave a lot because they are rich . But she gave even though she is poor . She put in everything she had . That was all she had to live on. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Mark	13	2	“ Do you see these huge buildings ? ” Jesus asked . “ Not one stone here will be left on top of another . Every stone will be thrown down. ”
NIRV	Mark	13	3	Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives , across from the temple . Peter , James , John and Andrew asked him a question in private .
NIRV	Mark	13	4	“ Tell us , ” they said . “ When will these things happen ? And what will be the sign that they are all about to come true ? ”
NIRV	Mark	13	5	Jesus said to them , “ Keep watch ! Be careful that no one fools you .
NIRV	Mark	13	6	Many will come in my name . They will claim , ‘ I am he. ’ They will fool many people .
NIRV	Mark	13	7	You will hear about wars . You will also hear people talking about future wars . Don ’ t be alarmed . These things must happen . But the end still isn ’ t here .
NIRV	Mark	13	8	Nation will fight against nation . Kingdom will fight against kingdom . There will be earthquakes in many places . People will go hungry . All these things are the beginning of birth pains .
NIRV	Mark	13	9	“ Watch out ! You will be handed over to the local courts . You will be whipped in the synagogues . You will stand in front of governors and kings because of me . In that way you will be witnesses to them .
NIRV	Mark	13	10	The good news has to be preached to all nations before the end comes .
NIRV	Mark	13	11	You will be arrested and brought to trial . But don ’ t worry ahead of time about what you will say . Just say what God brings to your mind at the time . It is not you speaking , but the Holy Spirit .
NIRV	Mark	13	12	“ Brothers will hand over brothers to be killed . Fathers will hand over their children . Children will rise up against their parents and have them put to death .
NIRV	Mark	13	14	“ You will see ‘ the hated thing that destroys. ’ ( Daniel 9:27 ; 11:31 ; 12:11 ) It will stand where it does not belong . The reader should understand this . Then those who are in Judea should escape to the mountains .
NIRV	Mark	13	15	No one on the roof should go down into the house to take anything out .
NIRV	Mark	13	16	No one in the field should go back to get their coat .
NIRV	Mark	13	17	How awful it will be in those days for pregnant women ! How awful for nursing mothers !
NIRV	Mark	13	18	Pray that this will not happen in winter .
NIRV	Mark	13	19	Those days will be worse than any others from the time God created the world until now . And there will never be any like them again .
NIRV	Mark	13	20	“ If the Lord had not cut the time short , no one would live . But because of God ’ s chosen people , he has shortened it .
NIRV	Mark	13	21	At that time someone may say to you , ‘ Look ! Here is the Messiah ! ’ Or , ‘ Look ! There he is ! ’ Do not believe it .
NIRV	Mark	13	22	False messiahs and false prophets will appear . They will do signs and miracles . They will try to fool God ’ s chosen people if possible .
NIRV	Mark	13	23	Keep watch ! I have told you everything ahead of time .
NIRV	Mark	13	24	“ So in those days there will be terrible suffering . After that , Scripture says , “ ‘ The sun will be darkened . The moon will not shine .
NIRV	Mark	13	25	The stars will fall from the sky . The heavenly bodies will be shaken. ’ ( Isaiah 13:10 ; 34:4 )
NIRV	Mark	13	26	“ At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds . He will come with great power and glory .
NIRV	Mark	13	27	He will send his angels . He will gather his chosen people from all four directions . He will bring them from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens .
NIRV	Mark	13	28	“ Learn a lesson from the fig tree . As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out , you know that summer is near .
NIRV	Mark	13	29	In the same way , when you see these things happening , you know that the end is near . It is right at the door .
NIRV	Mark	13	30	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . The people living now will certainly not pass away until all those things have happened .
NIRV	Mark	13	31	Heaven and earth will pass away . But my words will never pass away . The Day and Hour Are Not Known
NIRV	Mark	13	32	“ But no one knows about that day or hour . Not even the angels in heaven know . The Son does not know . Only the Father knows .
NIRV	Mark	13	33	Keep watch ! Stay awake ! You do not know when that time will come .
NIRV	Mark	13	34	It ’ s like a man going away . He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge . Each one is given a task to do . He tells the one at the door to keep watch .
NIRV	Mark	13	35	“ So keep watch ! You do not know when the owner of the house will come back . It may be in the evening or at midnight . It may be when the rooster crows or at dawn .

NIRV	Mark	14	14	He will enter a house . Say to its owner , ‘ The Teacher asks , “ Where is my guest room ? Where can I eat the Passover meal with my disciples ? ” ’
NIRV	Mark	14	2	“ But not during the feast , ” they said . “ The people may stir up trouble. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	3	Jesus was in Bethany . He was at the table in the home of Simon , who had a skin disease . A woman came with a special sealed jar . It contained very expensive perfume made out of pure nard . She broke the jar open and poured the perfume on Jesus ’ head .
NIRV	Mark	14	4	Some of the people there became angry . They said to one another , “ Why waste this perfume ?
NIRV	Mark	14	5	It could have been sold for more than a year ’ s pay . The money could have been given to poor people. ” So they found fault with the woman .
NIRV	Mark	14	6	“ Leave her alone , ” Jesus said . “ Why are you bothering her ? She has done a beautiful thing to me .
NIRV	Mark	14	7	You will always have poor people with you . You can help them any time you want to . But you will not always have me .
NIRV	Mark	14	8	She did what she could . She poured perfume on my body to prepare me to be buried .
NIRV	Mark	14	9	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . What she has done will be told anywhere the good news is preached all over the world . It will be told in memory of her. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	10	Judas Iscariot was one of the
NIRV	Mark	14	12	disciples . A crowd was with him . They were carrying swords and clubs . The chief priests , the teachers of the law , and the elders had sent them .
NIRV	Mark	14	11	They were delighted to hear that he would do this . They promised to give Judas money . So he watched for the right time to hand Jesus over to them . The Last Supper
NIRV	Mark	14	13	So he sent out two of his disciples . He told them , “ Go into the city . A man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him .
NIRV	Mark	14	15	He will show you a large upstairs room . It will have furniture and will be ready . Prepare for us to eat there. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	16	The disciples left and went into the city . They found things just as Jesus had told them . So they prepared the Passover meal .
NIRV	Mark	14	17	When evening came , Jesus arrived with the
NIRV	Mark	14	18	While they were at the table eating , Jesus said , “ What I ’ m about to tell you is true . One of you who is eating with me will hand me over to my enemies. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	19	The disciples became sad . One by one they said to him , “ Surely you don ’ t mean me ? ”
NIRV	Mark	14	20	“ It is one of you , ” Jesus replied . “ It is the one who dips bread into the bowl with me .
NIRV	Mark	14	21	The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him . But how terrible it will be for the one who hands over the Son of Man ! It would be better for him if he had not been born. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	22	While they were eating , Jesus took bread . He gave thanks and broke it . He handed it to his disciples and said , “ Take it . This is my body. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	23	Then he took a cup . He gave thanks and handed it to them . All of them drank from it .
NIRV	Mark	14	24	“ This is my blood of the covenant , ” he said to them . “ It is poured out for many .
NIRV	Mark	14	25	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . I won ’ t drink wine with you again until the day I drink it in God ’ s kingdom. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	26	Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives . Jesus Says That the Disciples Will Turn Away
NIRV	Mark	14	27	“ You will all turn away , ” Jesus told the disciples . “ It is written , “ ‘ I will strike the shepherd down . Then the sheep will be scattered. ’ ( Zechariah 13:7 )
NIRV	Mark	14	28	But after I rise from the dead , I will go ahead of you into Galilee. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	29	Peter said , “ All the others may turn away . But I will not. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	30	“ What I ’ m about to tell you is true , ” Jesus answered . “ It will happen today , in fact tonight . Before the rooster crows twice , you yourself will say three times that you don ’ t know me. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	31	But Peter would not give in . He said , “ I may have to die with you . But I will never say I don ’ t know you. ” And all the others said the same thing . Jesus Prays in Gethsemane
NIRV	Mark	14	32	Jesus and his disciples went to a place called Gethsemane . Jesus said to them , “ Sit here while I pray. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	33	He took Peter , James and John along with him . He began to be very upset and troubled .
NIRV	Mark	14	34	“ My soul is very sad . I feel close to death , ” he said to them . “ Stay here . Keep watch. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	35	He went a little farther . Then he fell to the ground . He prayed that , if possible , the hour might pass by him .
NIRV	Mark	14	36	“ Abba , Father , ” he said , “ everything is possible for you . Take this cup of suffering away from me . But let what you want be done , not what I want. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	37	Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping . “ Simon , ” he said to Peter , “ are you asleep ? Couldn ’ t you keep watch for one hour ?
NIRV	Mark	14	38	Watch and pray . Then you won ’ t fall into sin when you are tempted . The spirit is willing , but the body is weak. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	39	Once more Jesus went away and prayed the same thing .
NIRV	Mark	14	40	Then he came back . Again he found them sleeping . They couldn ’ t keep their eyes open . They did not know what to say to him .
NIRV	Mark	14	41	Jesus returned the third time . He said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? Enough ! The hour has come . Look ! The Son of Man is about to be handed over to sinners .
NIRV	Mark	14	42	Get up ! Let us go ! Here comes the one who is handing me over to them ! ” Jesus Is Arrested
NIRV	Mark	14	43	Just as Jesus was speaking , Judas appeared . He was one of the
NIRV	Mark	14	44	Judas , who was going to hand Jesus over , had arranged a signal with them . “ The one I kiss is the man , ” he said . “ Arrest him and have the guards lead him away. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	45	So Judas went to Jesus at once . Judas said , “ Rabbi ! ” And he kissed Jesus .
NIRV	Mark	14	46	The men grabbed Jesus and arrested him .
NIRV	Mark	14	47	Then one of those standing nearby pulled his sword out . He struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear .
NIRV	Mark	14	48	“ Am I leading a band of armed men against you ? ” asked Jesus . “ Do you have to come out with swords and clubs to capture me ?
NIRV	Mark	14	49	Every day I was with you . I taught in the temple courtyard , and you didn ’ t arrest me . But the Scriptures must come true. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	50	Then everyone left him and ran away .
NIRV	Mark	14	51	A young man was following Jesus . The man was wearing nothing but a piece of linen cloth . When the crowd grabbed him ,
NIRV	Mark	14	52	he ran away naked . He left his clothing behind . Jesus Is Taken to the Sanhedrin
NIRV	Mark	14	53	The crowd took Jesus to the high priest . All the chief priests , the elders , and the teachers of the law came together .
NIRV	Mark	14	54	Not too far away , Peter followed Jesus . He went right into the courtyard of the high priest . There he sat with the guards . He warmed himself at the fire .
NIRV	Mark	14	55	The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for something to use against Jesus . They wanted to put him to death . But they did not find any proof .
NIRV	Mark	14	56	Many witnesses lied about him . But their stories did not agree .
NIRV	Mark	14	57	Then some of them stood up . Here is what those false witnesses said about him .
NIRV	Mark	14	58	“ We heard him say , ‘ I will destroy this temple made by human hands . In three days I will build another temple , not made by human hands. ’ ”
NIRV	Mark	14	59	But what they said did not agree .
NIRV	Mark	14	60	Then the high priest stood up in front of them . He asked Jesus , “ Aren ’ t you going to answer ? What are these charges these men are bringing against you ? ”
NIRV	Mark	14	61	But Jesus remained silent . He gave no answer . Again the high priest asked him , “ Are you the Messiah ? Are you the Son of the Blessed One ? ”
NIRV	Mark	14	62	“ I am , ” said Jesus . “ And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One . You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	63	The high priest tore his clothes . “ Why do we need any more witnesses ? ” he asked .
NIRV	Mark	14	64	“ You have heard him say a very evil thing against God . What do you think ? ” They all found him guilty and said he must die .
NIRV	Mark	14	65	Then some began to spit at him . They blindfolded him . They hit him with their fists . They said , “ Prophesy ! ” And the guards took him and beat him . Peter Says He Does Not Know Jesus
NIRV	Mark	14	66	Peter was below in the courtyard . One of the high priest ’ s female servants came by .
NIRV	Mark	14	67	When she saw Peter warming himself , she looked closely at him . “ You also were with Jesus , that Nazarene , ” she said .
NIRV	Mark	14	68	But Peter said he had not been with him . “ I don ’ t know or understand what you ’ re talking about , ” he said . He went out to the entrance to the courtyard .
NIRV	Mark	14	69	The servant saw him there . She said again to those standing around , “ This fellow is one of them. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	70	Again he said he was not . After a little while , those standing nearby said to Peter , “ You must be one of them . You are from Galilee. ”
NIRV	Mark	14	71	Then Peter began to curse . He said to them , “ I don ’ t know this man you ’ re talking about ! ”
NIRV	Mark	14	72	Right away the rooster crowed the second time . Then Peter remembered what Jesus had spoken to him . “ The rooster will crow twice , ” he had said . “ Before it does , you will say three times that you don ’ t know me. ” Peter broke down and cried . Copyright ©

NIRV	Mark	15	3	The chief priests brought many charges against him .
NIRV	Mark	15	4	So Pilate asked him again , “ Aren ’ t you going to answer ? See how many things they charge you with. ”
NIRV	Mark	15	5	But Jesus still did not reply . Pilate was amazed .

NIRV	Mark	15	8	The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did .
NIRV	Mark	15	9	“ Do you want me to let the king of the Jews go free ? ” asked Pilate .
NIRV	Mark	15	10	He knew that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him because they wanted to get their own way .
NIRV	Mark	15	11	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd . So the crowd asked Pilate to let Barabbas go free instead .
NIRV	Mark	15	12	“ Then what should I do with the one you call the king of the Jews ? ” Pilate asked them .
NIRV	Mark	15	13	“ Crucify him ! ” the crowd shouted .
NIRV	Mark	15	14	“ Why ? What wrong has he done ? ” asked Pilate . But they shouted even louder , “ Crucify him ! ”
NIRV	Mark	15	16	The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace . It was called the Praetorium . They called together the whole company of soldiers .
NIRV	Mark	15	17	The soldiers put a purple robe on Jesus . Then they twisted thorns together to make a crown . They placed it on his head .
NIRV	Mark	15	18	They began to call out to him , “ We honor you , king of the Jews ! ”
NIRV	Mark	15	19	Again and again they hit him on the head with a stick . They spit on him . They fell on their knees and pretended to honor him .
NIRV	Mark	15	20	After they had made fun of him , they took off the purple robe . They put his own clothes back on him . Then they led him out to nail him to a cross . Jesus Is Nailed to a Cross
NIRV	Mark	15	21	A man named Simon was passing by . He was from Cyrene . He was the father of Alexander and Rufus . Simon was on his way in from the country . The soldiers forced him to carry the cross .
NIRV	Mark	15	22	They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha . The word Golgotha means the Place of the Skull .
NIRV	Mark	15	23	Then they gave him wine mixed with spices . But he did not take it .
NIRV	Mark	15	24	They nailed him to the cross . Then they divided up his clothes . They cast lots to see what each of them would get .
NIRV	Mark	15	25	It was nine o ’ clock in the morning when they crucified him .
NIRV	Mark	15	26	They wrote out the charge against him . It read , the king of the jews . 27-28 They crucified with him two rebels against Rome . One was on his right and one was on his left .

NIRV	Mark	15	30	Then come down from the cross ! Save yourself ! ”
NIRV	Mark	15	31	In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law made fun of him among themselves . “ He saved others , ” they said . “ But he can ’ t save himself !

NIRV	Luke	1	1	Many people have attempted to write about the things that have taken place among us .
NIRV	Luke	1	2	Reports of these things were handed down to us . There were people who saw these things for themselves from the beginning . They saw them and then passed the word on .
NIRV	Luke	1	3	With this in mind , I myself have carefully looked into everything from the beginning . So I also decided to write down an orderly report of exactly what happened . I am doing this for you , most excellent Theophilus .
NIRV	Luke	1	4	I want you to know that the things you have been taught are true . The Coming Birth of John the Baptist
NIRV	Luke	1	5	Herod was king of Judea . During the time he was ruling , there was a priest named Zechariah . He belonged to a group of priests named after Abijah . His wife Elizabeth also came from the family line of Aaron .
NIRV	Luke	1	6	Both of them did what was right in the sight of God . They obeyed all the Lord ’ s commands and rules faithfully .
NIRV	Luke	1	7	But they had no children , because Elizabeth was not able to have any . And they were both very old .
NIRV	Luke	1	8	One day Zechariah ’ s group was on duty . He was serving as a priest in God ’ s temple .
NIRV	Luke	1	9	He happened to be chosen , in the usual way , to go into the temple of the Lord . There he was supposed to burn incense .
NIRV	Luke	1	10	The time came for this to be done . All who had gathered to worship were praying outside .
NIRV	Luke	1	11	Then an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah . The angel was standing at the right side of the incense altar .
NIRV	Luke	1	12	When Zechariah saw him , he was amazed and terrified .
NIRV	Luke	1	13	But the angel said to him , “ Do not be afraid , Zechariah . Your prayer has been heard . Your wife Elizabeth will have a child . It will be a boy , and you must call him John .
NIRV	Luke	1	14	He will be a joy and delight to you . His birth will make many people very glad .
NIRV	Luke	1	15	He will be important in the sight of the Lord . He must never drink wine or other such drinks . He will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born .
NIRV	Luke	1	16	He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God .
NIRV	Luke	1	17	And he will prepare the way for the Lord . He will have the same spirit and power that Elijah had . He will bring peace between parents and their children . He will teach people who don ’ t obey to be wise and do what is right . In this way , he will prepare a people who are ready for the Lord. ”
NIRV	Luke	1	18	Zechariah asked the angel , “ How can I be sure of this ? I am an old man , and my wife is old too. ”
NIRV	Luke	1	19	The angel said to him , “ I am Gabriel . I serve God . I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news .
NIRV	Luke	1	20	And now you will have to be silent . You will not be able to speak until after John is born . That ’ s because you did not believe my words . They will come true at the time God has chosen. ”
NIRV	Luke	1	21	During that time , the people were waiting for Zechariah to come out of the temple . They wondered why he stayed there so long .
NIRV	Luke	1	22	When he came out , he could not speak to them . They realized he had seen a vision in the temple . They knew this because he kept gesturing to them . He still could not speak .
NIRV	Luke	1	23	When his time of service was over , he returned home .
NIRV	Luke	1	24	After that , his wife Elizabeth became pregnant . She stayed at home for five months .
NIRV	Luke	1	25	“ The Lord has done this for me , ” she said . “ In these days , he has been kind to me . He has taken away my shame among the people. ” The Coming Birth of Jesus

NIRV	Luke	1	27	He was sent to a virgin . The girl was engaged to a man named Joseph . He came from the family line of David . The virgin ’ s name was Mary .
NIRV	Luke	1	28	The angel greeted her and said , “ The Lord has blessed you in a special way . He is with you. ”
NIRV	Luke	1	29	Mary was very upset because of his words . She wondered what kind of greeting this could be .
NIRV	Luke	1	30	But the angel said to her , “ Do not be afraid , Mary . God is very pleased with you .
NIRV	Luke	1	31	You will become pregnant and give birth to a son . You must call him Jesus .
NIRV	Luke	1	32	He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High God . The Lord God will make him a king like his father David of long ago .
NIRV	Luke	1	33	The Son of the Most High God will rule forever over his people . They are from the family line of Jacob . That kingdom will never end. ”
NIRV	Luke	1	34	“ How can this happen ? ” Mary asked the angel . “ I am a virgin. ”
NIRV	Luke	1	35	The angel answered , “ The Holy Spirit will come to you . The power of the Most High God will cover you . So the holy one that is born will be called the Son of God .
NIRV	Luke	1	36	Your relative Elizabeth will have a child even though she is old . People thought she could not have children . But she has been pregnant for six months now .
NIRV	Luke	1	37	That ’ s because what God says will always come true. ”
NIRV	Luke	1	38	“ I serve the Lord , ” Mary answered . “ May it happen to me just as you said it would. ” Then the angel left her . Mary Visits Elizabeth
NIRV	Luke	1	39	At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in Judea ’ s hill country .
NIRV	Luke	1	40	There she entered Zechariah ’ s home and greeted Elizabeth .
NIRV	Luke	1	41	When Elizabeth heard Mary ’ s greeting , the baby inside her jumped . And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit .
NIRV	Luke	1	42	In a loud voice she called out , “ God has blessed you more than other women . And blessed is the child you will have !
NIRV	Luke	1	43	But why is God so kind to me ? Why has the mother of my Lord come to me ?
NIRV	Luke	1	44	As soon as I heard the sound of your voice , the baby inside me jumped for joy .
NIRV	Luke	1	45	You are a woman God has blessed . You have believed that the Lord would keep his promises to you ! ” Mary ’ s Song
NIRV	Luke	1	46	Mary said , “ My soul gives glory to the Lord .
NIRV	Luke	1	47	My spirit delights in God my Savior .
NIRV	Luke	1	48	He has taken note of me even though I am not considered important . From now on all people will call me blessed .
NIRV	Luke	1	49	The Mighty One has done great things for me . His name is holy .
NIRV	Luke	1	50	He shows his mercy to those who have respect for him , from parent to child down through the years .
NIRV	Luke	1	51	He has done mighty things with his powerful arm . He has scattered those who are proud in their deepest thoughts .
NIRV	Luke	1	52	He has brought down rulers from their thrones . But he has lifted up people who are not considered important .
NIRV	Luke	1	53	He has filled with good things those who are hungry . But he has sent away empty those who are rich .
NIRV	Luke	1	54	He has helped the people of Israel , who serve him . He has always remembered to be kind
NIRV	Luke	1	55	to Abraham and his children down through the years . He has done it just as he promised to our people of long ago. ”
NIRV	Luke	1	56	Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months . Then she returned home . John the Baptist Is Born
NIRV	Luke	1	57	The time came for Elizabeth to have her baby . She gave birth to a son .
NIRV	Luke	1	58	Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had been very kind to her . They shared her joy .
NIRV	Luke	1	59	On the eighth day , they came to have the child circumcised . They were going to name him Zechariah , like his father .
NIRV	Luke	1	60	But his mother spoke up . “ No ! ” she said . “ He must be called John. ”
NIRV	Luke	1	61	They said to her , “ No one among your relatives has that name. ”
NIRV	Luke	1	62	Then they motioned to his father . They wanted to find out what he would like to name the child .
NIRV	Luke	1	63	He asked for something to write on . Then he wrote , “ His name is John. ” Everyone was amazed .
NIRV	Luke	1	64	Right away Zechariah could speak again . Right away he praised God .
NIRV	Luke	1	65	All his neighbors were filled with fear and wonder . Throughout Judea ’ s hill country , people were talking about all these things .
NIRV	Luke	1	66	Everyone who heard this wondered about it . And because the Lord was with John , they asked , “ What is this child going to be ? ” Zechariah ’ s Song
NIRV	Luke	1	67	John ’ s father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit . He prophesied ,
NIRV	Luke	1	68	“ Give praise to the Lord , the God of Israel ! He has come to his people and purchased their freedom .
NIRV	Luke	1	69	He has acted with great power and has saved us . He did it for those who are from the family line of his servant David .
NIRV	Luke	1	70	Long ago holy prophets said he would do it .
NIRV	Luke	1	71	He has saved us from our enemies . We are rescued from all who hate us .
NIRV	Luke	1	72	He has been kind to our people of long ago . He has remembered his holy covenant .
NIRV	Luke	1	73	He made a promise to our father Abraham .
NIRV	Luke	1	74	He promised to save us from our enemies . Then we could serve him without fear .
NIRV	Luke	1	75	He wants us to be holy and godly as long as we live .
NIRV	Luke	1	76	“ And you , my child , will be called a prophet of the Most High God . You will go ahead of the Lord to prepare the way for him .
NIRV	Luke	1	77	You will tell his people how they can be saved . You will tell them that their sins can be forgiven .
NIRV	Luke	1	78	All of that will happen because our God is tender and caring . His kindness will bring the rising sun to us from heaven .
NIRV	Luke	1	79	It will shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death . It will guide our feet on the path of peace. ”
NIRV	Luke	1	80	The child grew up , and his spirit became strong . He lived in the desert until he appeared openly to Israel . Copyright ©

NIRV	Luke	2	31	You have prepared it in the sight of all nations .
NIRV	Luke	2	32	It is a light to be given to the Gentiles . It will be the glory of your people Israel. ”
NIRV	Luke	2	33	The child ’ s father and mother were amazed at what was said about him .
NIRV	Luke	2	34	Then Simeon blessed them . He said to Mary , Jesus ’ mother , “ This child is going to cause many people in Israel to fall and to rise . God has sent him . But many will speak against him .
NIRV	Luke	2	35	The thoughts of many hearts will be known . A sword will wound your own soul too. ”

NIRV	Luke	2	42	When Jesus was
NIRV	Luke	2	43	After the feast was over , his parents left to go back home . The boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem . But they were not aware of it .
NIRV	Luke	2	44	They thought he was somewhere in their group . So they traveled on for a day . Then they began to look for him among their relatives and friends .

NIRV	Luke	5	13	Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man . “ I am willing to do it , ” he said . “ Be ‘ clean ’ ! ” Right away the disease left him .
NIRV	Luke	5	14	Then Jesus ordered him , “ Don ’ t tell anyone . Go and show yourself to the priest . Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded . It will be a witness to the priest and the people that you are ‘ clean. ’ ”

NIRV	Luke	5	19	They could not find a way to do this because of the crowd . So they went up on the roof . Then they lowered the man on his mat through the opening in the roof tiles . They lowered him into the middle of the crowd , right in front of Jesus .
NIRV	Luke	5	20	When Jesus saw that they had faith , he spoke to the man . He said , “ Friend , your sins are forgiven. ”
NIRV	Luke	5	21	The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to think , “ Who is this fellow who says such an evil thing ? Who can forgive sins but God alone ? ”
NIRV	Luke	5	22	Jesus knew what they were thinking . So he asked , “ Why are you thinking these things in your hearts ?
NIRV	Luke	5	23	Is it easier to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven ’ ? Or to say , ‘ Get up and walk ’ ?
NIRV	Luke	5	24	But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. ” So he spoke to the man who could not walk . “ I tell you , ” he said , “ get up . Take your mat and go home. ”
NIRV	Luke	5	25	Right away , the man stood up in front of them . He took his mat and went home praising God .

NIRV	Luke	5	30	But the Pharisees and their teachers of the law complained to Jesus ’ disciples . They said , “ Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
NIRV	Luke	5	31	Jesus answered them , “ Healthy people don ’ t need a doctor . Sick people do .

NIRV	Luke	5	33	Some of the people who were there said to Jesus , “ John ’ s disciples often pray and go without eating . So do the disciples of the Pharisees . But yours go on eating and drinking. ”
NIRV	Luke	5	34	Jesus answered , “ Can you make the friends of the groom fast while he is with them ?
NIRV	Luke	5	35	But the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them . In those days they will go without eating. ”
NIRV	Luke	5	36	Then Jesus gave them an example . He said , “ No one tears a piece out of new clothes to patch old clothes . Otherwise , they will tear the new clothes . Also , the patch from the new clothes will not match the old clothes .
NIRV	Luke	5	37	No one pours new wine into old wineskins . Otherwise , the new wine will burst the skins . The wine will run out , and the wineskins will be destroyed .

NIRV	Luke	6	2	Some of the Pharisees said , “ It is against the Law to do this on the Sabbath day . Why are you doing it ? ”
NIRV	Luke	6	3	Jesus answered them , “ Haven ’ t you ever read about what David did ? He and his men were hungry .
NIRV	Luke	6	4	He entered the house of God and took the holy bread . He ate the bread that only priests were allowed to eat . David also gave some to his men. ”

NIRV	Luke	6	8	But Jesus knew what they were thinking . He spoke to the man who had the weak and twisted hand . “ Get up and stand in front of everyone , ” he said . So the man got up and stood there .
NIRV	Luke	6	9	Then Jesus said to them , “ What does the Law say we should do on the Sabbath day ? Should we do good ? Or should we do evil ? Should we save life ? Or should we destroy it ? ”

NIRV	Luke	6	21	Blessed are you who are hungry now . You will be satisfied . Blessed are you who are sad now . You will laugh .
NIRV	Luke	6	22	Blessed are you when people hate you , when they have nothing to do with you and say bad things about you , and when they treat your name as something evil . They do all this because you are followers of the Son of Man .
NIRV	Luke	6	23	“ The prophets of long ago were treated the same way . When these things happen to you , be glad and jump for joy . You will receive many blessings in heaven .
NIRV	Luke	6	24	“ But how terrible it will be for you who are rich ! You have already had your easy life .
NIRV	Luke	6	25	How terrible for you who are well fed now ! You will go hungry . How terrible for you who laugh now ! You will cry and be sad .

NIRV	Luke	6	29	Suppose someone slaps you on one cheek . Let them slap you on the other cheek as well . Suppose someone takes your coat . Don ’ t stop them from taking your shirt as well .
NIRV	Luke	6	30	Give to everyone who asks you . And if anyone takes what belongs to you , don ’ t ask to get it back .
NIRV	Luke	6	31	Do to others as you want them to do to you .
NIRV	Luke	6	32	“ Suppose you love those who love you . Should anyone praise you for that ? Even sinners love those who love them .
NIRV	Luke	6	33	And suppose you do good to those who are good to you . Should anyone praise you for that ? Even sinners do that .
NIRV	Luke	6	34	And suppose you lend money to those who can pay you back . Should anyone praise you for that ? Even a sinner lends to sinners , expecting them to pay everything back .
NIRV	Luke	6	35	But love your enemies . Do good to them . Lend to them without expecting to get anything back . Then you will receive a lot in return . And you will be children of the Most High God . He is kind to people who are evil and are not thankful .

NIRV	Luke	7	7	That is why I did not even think I was fit to come to you . But just say the word , and my servant will be healed .
NIRV	Luke	7	2	There the servant of a Roman commander was sick and about to die . His master thought highly of him .
NIRV	Luke	7	3	The commander heard about Jesus . So he sent some elders of the Jews to him . He told them to ask Jesus to come and heal his servant .
NIRV	Luke	7	4	They came to Jesus and begged him , “ This man deserves to have you do this .
NIRV	Luke	7	5	He loves our nation and has built our synagogue. ”
NIRV	Luke	7	6	So Jesus went with them . When Jesus came near the house , the Roman commander sent friends to him . He told them to say , “ Lord , don ’ t trouble yourself . I am not good enough to have you come into my house .
NIRV	Luke	7	8	I myself am a man who is under authority . And I have soldiers who obey my orders . I tell this one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes . I tell that one , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes . I say to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and he does it. ”
NIRV	Luke	7	9	When Jesus heard this , he was amazed at the commander . Jesus turned to the crowd that was following him . He said , “ I tell you , even in Israel I have not found anyone whose faith is so strong. ”
NIRV	Luke	7	10	Then the men who had been sent to Jesus returned to the house . They found that the servant was healed . Jesus Raises a Widow ’ s Son From the Dead
NIRV	Luke	7	11	Some time later , Jesus went to a town called Nain . His disciples and a large crowd went along with him .
NIRV	Luke	7	12	He approached the town gate . Just then , a dead person was being carried out . He was the only son of his mother . She was a widow . A large crowd from the town was with her .
NIRV	Luke	7	13	When the Lord saw her , he felt sorry for her . So he said , “ Don ’ t cry. ”
NIRV	Luke	7	14	Then he went up and touched the coffin . Those carrying it stood still . Jesus said , “ Young man , I say to you , get up ! ”
NIRV	Luke	7	15	The dead man sat up and began to talk . Then Jesus gave him back to his mother .
NIRV	Luke	7	16	The people were all filled with wonder and praised God . “ A great prophet has appeared among us , ” they said . “ God has come to help his people. ”
NIRV	Luke	7	17	This news about Jesus spread all through Judea and the whole country . Jesus and John the Baptist
NIRV	Luke	7	18	John ’ s disciples told him about all these things . So he chose two of them .
NIRV	Luke	7	19	He sent them to the Lord . John told them to ask him , “ Are you the one who is supposed to come ? Or should we look for someone else ? ”
NIRV	Luke	7	20	The men came to Jesus . They said , “ John the Baptist sent us to ask you , ‘ Are you the one who is supposed to come ? Or should we look for someone else ? ’ ”
NIRV	Luke	7	21	At that time Jesus healed many people . They had illnesses , sicknesses and evil spirits . He also gave sight to many who were blind .
NIRV	Luke	7	22	So Jesus replied to the messengers , “ Go back to John . Tell him what you have seen and heard . Blind people receive sight . Disabled people walk . Those who have skin diseases are made ‘ clean. ’ Deaf people hear . Those who are dead are raised to life . And the good news is announced to those who are poor .
NIRV	Luke	7	23	Blessed is anyone who does not give up their faith because of me. ”
NIRV	Luke	7	24	So John ’ s messengers left . Then Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John . He said , “ What did you go out into the desert to see ? Tall grass waving in the wind ?
NIRV	Luke	7	25	If not , what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in fine clothes ? No . Those who wear fine clothes and have many expensive things are in palaces .
NIRV	Luke	7	26	Then what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
NIRV	Luke	7	27	He is the one written about in Scripture . It says , “ ‘ I will send my messenger ahead of you . He will prepare your way for you. ’ ( Malachi 3:1 )
NIRV	Luke	7	28	I tell you , no one more important than John has ever been born . But the least important person in God ’ s kingdom is more important than John is. ”
NIRV	Luke	7	29	All the people who heard Jesus ’ words agreed that God ’ s way was right . Even the tax collectors agreed . These people had all been baptized by John .
NIRV	Luke	7	30	But the Pharisees and the authorities on the law did not accept for themselves God ’ s purpose . So they had not been baptized by John .
NIRV	Luke	7	31	Jesus went on to say , “ What can I compare today ’ s people to ? What are they like ?
NIRV	Luke	7	32	They are like children sitting in the market and calling out to each other . They say , “ ‘ We played the flute for you . But you didn ’ t dance . We sang a funeral song . But you didn ’ t cry. ’
NIRV	Luke	7	33	That is how it has been with John the Baptist . When he came to you , he didn ’ t eat bread or drink wine . And you say , ‘ He has a demon. ’
NIRV	Luke	7	34	But when the Son of Man came , he ate and drank as you do . And you say , ‘ This fellow is always eating and drinking far too much . He ’ s a friend of tax collectors and sinners. ’
NIRV	Luke	7	35	All who follow wisdom prove that wisdom is right. ” A Sinful Woman Pours Perfume on Jesus
NIRV	Luke	7	36	One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him . So he went to the Pharisee ’ s house . He took his place at the table .
NIRV	Luke	7	37	There was a woman in that town who had lived a sinful life . She learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee ’ s house . So she came there with a special jar of perfume .
NIRV	Luke	7	38	She stood behind Jesus and cried at his feet . And she began to wet his feet with her tears . Then she wiped them with her hair . She kissed them and poured perfume on them .
NIRV	Luke	7	39	The Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this . He said to himself , “ If this man were a prophet , he would know who is touching him . He would know what kind of woman she is . She is a sinner ! ”
NIRV	Luke	7	40	Jesus answered him , “ Simon , I have something to tell you. ” “ Tell me , teacher , ” he said .
NIRV	Luke	7	41	“ Two people owed money to a certain lender . One owed him
NIRV	Luke	7	500	silver coins . The other owed him

NIRV	Luke	7	42	Neither of them had the money to pay him back . So he let them go without paying . Which of them will love him more ? ”
NIRV	Luke	7	43	Simon replied , “ I suppose the one who owed the most money. ” “ You are right , ” Jesus said .
NIRV	Luke	7	44	Then he turned toward the woman . He said to Simon , “ Do you see this woman ? I came into your house . You did not give me any water to wash my feet . But she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair .
NIRV	Luke	7	45	You did not give me a kiss . But this woman has not stopped kissing my feet since I came in .
NIRV	Luke	7	46	You did not put any olive oil on my head . But she has poured this perfume on my feet .
NIRV	Luke	7	47	So I tell you this . Her many sins have been forgiven . She has shown that she understands this by her great acts of love . But whoever has been forgiven only a little loves only a little. ”
NIRV	Luke	7	48	Then Jesus said to her , “ Your sins are forgiven. ”
NIRV	Luke	7	49	The other guests began to talk about this among themselves . They said , “ Who is this who even forgives sins ? ”

NIRV	Luke	8	8	Still other seed fell on good soil . It grew up and produced a crop
NIRV	Luke	8	12	years . No one could heal her .
NIRV	Luke	8	2	So were some women who had been healed of evil spirits and sicknesses . One was Mary Magdalene . Seven demons had come out of her .
NIRV	Luke	8	3	Another was Joanna , the wife of Chuza . He was the manager of Herod ’ s household . Susanna and many others were there also . These women were helping to support Jesus and the
NIRV	Luke	8	4	A large crowd gathered together . People came to Jesus from town after town . As they did , he told a story . He said ,
NIRV	Luke	8	5	“ A farmer went out to plant his seed . He scattered the seed on the ground . Some fell on a path . People walked on it , and the birds ate it up .
NIRV	Luke	8	6	Some seed fell on rocky ground . When it grew , the plants dried up because they had no water .
NIRV	Luke	8	7	Other seed fell among thorns . The thorns grew up with it and crowded out the plants .
NIRV	Luke	8	100	times more than the farmer planted. ” When Jesus said this , he called out , “ Whoever has ears should listen. ”
NIRV	Luke	8	9	His disciples asked him what the story meant .
NIRV	Luke	8	10	He said , “ You have been given the chance to understand the secrets of God ’ s kingdom . But to outsiders I speak by using stories . In that way , “ ‘ They see , but they will not know what they are seeing . They hear , but they will not understand what they are hearing. ’ ( Isaiah 6:9 )
NIRV	Luke	8	11	“ Here is what the story means . The seed is God ’ s message .
NIRV	Luke	8	13	The seed on rocky ground stands for those who hear the message and receive it with joy . But they have no roots . They believe for a while . But when they are tested , they fall away from the faith .
NIRV	Luke	8	14	The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear the message . But as they go on their way , they are choked by life ’ s worries , riches and pleasures . So they do not reach full growth .
NIRV	Luke	8	15	But the seed on good soil stands for those with an honest and good heart . Those people hear the message . They keep it in their hearts . They remain faithful and produce a good crop . A Lamp on a Stand
NIRV	Luke	8	16	“ No one lights a lamp and then hides it in a clay jar or puts it under a bed . Instead , they put it on a stand . Then those who come in can see its light .
NIRV	Luke	8	17	What is hidden will be seen . And what is out of sight will be brought into the open and made known .
NIRV	Luke	8	18	So be careful how you listen . Whoever has something will be given more . Whoever has nothing , even what they think they have will be taken away from them. ” Jesus ’ Mother and Brothers
NIRV	Luke	8	19	Jesus ’ mother and brothers came to see him . But they could not get near him because of the crowd .
NIRV	Luke	8	20	Someone told him , “ Your mother and brothers are standing outside . They want to see you. ”
NIRV	Luke	8	21	He replied , “ My mother and brothers are those who hear God ’ s word and do what it says. ” Jesus Calms the Storm
NIRV	Luke	8	22	One day Jesus said to his disciples , “ Let ’ s go over to the other side of the lake. ” So they got into a boat and left .
NIRV	Luke	8	23	As they sailed , Jesus fell asleep . A storm came down on the lake . It was so bad that the boat was about to sink . They were in great danger .
NIRV	Luke	8	24	The disciples went and woke Jesus up . They said , “ Master ! Master ! We ’ re going to drown ! ” He got up and ordered the wind and the huge waves to stop . The storm quieted down . It was completely calm .
NIRV	Luke	8	25	“ Where is your faith ? ” he asked his disciples . They were amazed and full of fear . They asked one another , “ Who is this ? He commands even the winds and the waves , and they obey him. ” Jesus Heals a Man Controlled by Demons
NIRV	Luke	8	26	Jesus and his disciples sailed to the area of the Gerasenes across the lake from Galilee .
NIRV	Luke	8	27	When Jesus stepped on shore , he was met by a man from the town . The man was controlled by demons . For a long time he had not worn clothes or lived in a house . He lived in the tombs .
NIRV	Luke	8	28	When he saw Jesus , he cried out and fell at his feet . He shouted at the top of his voice , “ Jesus , Son of the Most High God , what do you want with me ? I beg you , don ’ t hurt me ! ”
NIRV	Luke	8	29	This was because Jesus had commanded the evil spirit to come out of the man . Many times the spirit had taken hold of him . The man ’ s hands and feet were chained , and he was kept under guard . But he had broken his chains . And then the demon had forced him to go out into lonely places in the countryside .
NIRV	Luke	8	30	Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” “ Legion , ” he replied , because many demons had gone into him .
NIRV	Luke	8	31	And they begged Jesus again and again not to order them to go into the Abyss .
NIRV	Luke	8	32	A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside . The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs . And he allowed it .
NIRV	Luke	8	33	When the demons came out of the man , they went into the pigs . Then the herd rushed down the steep bank . They ran into the lake and drowned .
NIRV	Luke	8	34	Those who were tending the pigs saw what had happened . They ran off and reported it in the town and countryside .
NIRV	Luke	8	35	The people went out to see what had happened . Then they came to Jesus . They found the man who was now free of the demons . He was sitting at Jesus ’ feet . He was dressed and thinking clearly . All this made the people afraid .
NIRV	Luke	8	36	Those who had seen it told the others how the man who had been controlled by demons was now healed .
NIRV	Luke	8	37	Then all the people who lived in the area of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them . They were filled with fear . So he got into the boat and left .
NIRV	Luke	8	38	The man who was now free of the demons begged to go with him . But Jesus sent him away . He said to him ,
NIRV	Luke	8	39	“ Return home and tell how much God has done for you. ” So the man went away . He told people all over town how much Jesus had done for him . Jesus Heals a Dead Girl and a Suffering Woman
NIRV	Luke	8	40	When Jesus returned , a crowd welcomed him . They were all expecting him .
NIRV	Luke	8	41	Then a man named Jairus came . He was a synagogue leader . He fell at Jesus ’ feet and begged Jesus to come to his house .
NIRV	Luke	8	42	His only daughter was dying . She was about
NIRV	Luke	8	43	A woman was there who had a sickness that made her bleed . Her sickness had lasted for
NIRV	Luke	8	44	She came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his clothes . Right away her bleeding stopped .
NIRV	Luke	8	45	“ Who touched me ? ” Jesus asked . Everyone said they didn ’ t do it . Then Peter said , “ Master , the people are crowding and pushing against you. ”
NIRV	Luke	8	46	But Jesus said , “ Someone touched me . I know that power has gone out from me. ”
NIRV	Luke	8	47	The woman realized that people would notice her . Shaking with fear , she came and fell at his feet . In front of everyone , she told why she had touched him . She also told how she had been healed in an instant .
NIRV	Luke	8	48	Then he said to her , “ Dear woman , your faith has healed you . Go in peace. ”
NIRV	Luke	8	49	While Jesus was still speaking , someone came from the house of Jairus . Jairus was the synagogue leader . “ Your daughter is dead , ” the messenger said . “ Don ’ t bother the teacher anymore. ”
NIRV	Luke	8	50	Hearing this , Jesus said to Jairus , “ Don ’ t be afraid . Just believe . She will be healed. ”
NIRV	Luke	8	51	When he arrived at the house of Jairus , he did not let everyone go in with him . He took only Peter , John and James , and the child ’ s father and mother .
NIRV	Luke	8	52	During this time , all the people were crying and sobbing loudly over the child . “ Stop crying ! ” Jesus said . “ She is not dead . She is sleeping. ”
NIRV	Luke	8	53	They laughed at him . They knew she was dead .
NIRV	Luke	8	54	But he took her by the hand and said , “ My child , get up ! ”
NIRV	Luke	8	55	Her spirit returned , and right away she stood up . Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat .
NIRV	Luke	8	56	Her parents were amazed . But Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened . Copyright ©

NIRV	Luke	9	12	baskets of leftover pieces . Peter Says That Jesus Is the Messiah
NIRV	Luke	9	2	Then he sent them out to announce God ’ s kingdom and to heal those who were sick .
NIRV	Luke	9	3	He told them , “ Don ’ t take anything for the journey . Do not take a walking stick or a bag . Do not take any bread , money or extra clothes .
NIRV	Luke	9	4	When you are invited into a house , stay there until you leave town .
NIRV	Luke	9	5	Some people may not welcome you . If they don ’ t , leave their town and shake the dust off your feet . This will be a witness against the people living there. ”
NIRV	Luke	9	6	So the
NIRV	Luke	9	7	Now Herod , the ruler of Galilee , heard about everything that was going on . He was bewildered , because some were saying that John the Baptist had been raised from the dead .
NIRV	Luke	9	8	Others were saying that Elijah had appeared . Still others were saying that a prophet of long ago had come back to life .
NIRV	Luke	9	10	The disciples returned . They told Jesus what they had done . Then he took them with him . They went off by themselves to a town called Bethsaida .
NIRV	Luke	9	11	But the crowds learned about it and followed Jesus . He welcomed them and spoke to them about God ’ s kingdom . He also healed those who needed to be healed .
NIRV	Luke	9	13	Jesus replied , “ You give them something to eat. ” The disciples answered , “ We have only five loaves of bread and two fish . We would have to go and buy food for all this crowd. ”
NIRV	Luke	9	14	About 5,000 men were there . But Jesus said to his disciples , “ Have them sit down in groups of about
NIRV	Luke	9	50	“ Do not stop him , ” Jesus said . “ Anyone who is not against you is for you. ” The Samaritans Do Not Welcome Jesus
NIRV	Luke	9	15	The disciples did so , and everyone sat down .
NIRV	Luke	9	16	Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish . He looked up to heaven and gave thanks . He broke them into pieces . Then he gave them to the disciples to give to the people .
NIRV	Luke	9	17	All of them ate and were satisfied . The disciples picked up
NIRV	Luke	9	18	One day Jesus was praying alone . Only his disciples were with him . He asked them , “ Who do the crowds say I am ? ”
NIRV	Luke	9	19	They replied , “ Some say John the Baptist . Others say Elijah . Still others say that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life. ”
NIRV	Luke	9	20	“ But what about you ? ” he asked . “ Who do you say I am ? ” Peter answered , “ God ’ s Messiah. ” Jesus Speaks About His Coming Death
NIRV	Luke	9	21	Jesus strongly warned them not to tell this to anyone .
NIRV	Luke	9	22	He said , “ The Son of Man must suffer many things . The elders will not accept him . The chief priests and the teachers of the law will not accept him either . He must be killed and on the third day rise from the dead. ”
NIRV	Luke	9	23	Then he said to all of them , “ Whoever wants to follow me must say no to themselves . They must pick up their cross every day and follow me .
NIRV	Luke	9	24	Whoever wants to save their life will lose it . But whoever loses their life for me will save it .
NIRV	Luke	9	25	What good is it if someone gains the whole world but loses or gives up their very self ?
NIRV	Luke	9	26	Suppose someone is ashamed of me and my words . The Son of Man will come in his glory and in the glory of the Father and the holy angels . Then he will be ashamed of that person .
NIRV	Luke	9	27	“ What I ’ m about to tell you is true . Some who are standing here will not die before they see God ’ s kingdom. ” Jesus ’ Appearance Is Changed
NIRV	Luke	9	28	About eight days after Jesus said this , he went up on a mountain to pray . He took Peter , John and James with him .
NIRV	Luke	9	29	As he was praying , the appearance of his face changed . His clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning .
NIRV	Luke	9	30	Two men , Moses and Elijah , appeared in shining glory . Jesus and the two of them talked together .
NIRV	Luke	9	31	They talked about how he would be leaving them soon . This was going to happen in Jerusalem .
NIRV	Luke	9	32	Peter and his companions had been very sleepy . But then they became completely awake . They saw Jesus ’ glory and the two men standing with him .
NIRV	Luke	9	33	As the men were leaving Jesus , Peter spoke up . “ Master , ” he said to him , “ it is good for us to be here . Let us put up three shelters . One will be for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah. ” Peter didn ’ t really know what he was saying .
NIRV	Luke	9	34	While he was speaking , a cloud appeared and covered them . The disciples were afraid as they entered the cloud .
NIRV	Luke	9	35	A voice came from the cloud . It said , “ This is my Son , and I have chosen him . Listen to him. ”
NIRV	Luke	9	36	When the voice had spoken , they found that Jesus was alone . The disciples kept quiet about this . They didn ’ t tell anyone at that time what they had seen . Jesus Heals a Boy Who Is Controlled by an Evil Spirit
NIRV	Luke	9	37	The next day Jesus and those who were with him came down from the mountain . A large crowd met Jesus .
NIRV	Luke	9	38	A man in the crowd called out . “ Teacher , ” he said , “ I beg you to look at my son . He is my only child .
NIRV	Luke	9	39	A spirit takes hold of him , and he suddenly screams . It throws him into fits so that he foams at the mouth . It hardly ever leaves him . It is destroying him .
NIRV	Luke	9	40	I begged your disciples to drive it out . But they couldn ’ t do it. ”
NIRV	Luke	9	41	“ You unbelieving and evil people ! ” Jesus replied . “ How long do I have to stay with you ? How long do I have to put up with you ? ” Then he said to the man , “ Bring your son here. ”
NIRV	Luke	9	42	Even while the boy was coming , the demon threw him into a fit . The boy fell to the ground . But Jesus ordered the evil spirit to leave the boy . Then Jesus healed him and gave him back to his father .
NIRV	Luke	9	43	They were all amazed at God ’ s greatness . Jesus Speaks a Second Time About His Coming Death Everyone was wondering about all that Jesus did . Then Jesus said to his disciples ,
NIRV	Luke	9	44	“ Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you . The Son of Man is going to be handed over to men. ”
NIRV	Luke	9	45	But they didn ’ t understand what this meant . That was because it was hidden from them . And they were afraid to ask Jesus about it . Who Is the Most Important Person ?
NIRV	Luke	9	46	The disciples began to argue about which one of them would be the most important person .
NIRV	Luke	9	47	Jesus knew what they were thinking . So he took a little child and had the child stand beside him .
NIRV	Luke	9	48	Then he spoke to them . “ Anyone who welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me , ” he said . “ And anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me . The one considered least important among all of you is really the most important. ”
NIRV	Luke	9	49	“ Master , ” said John , “ we saw someone driving out demons in your name . We tried to stop him , because he is not one of us. ”
NIRV	Luke	9	51	The time grew near for Jesus to be taken up to heaven . So he made up his mind to go to Jerusalem .
NIRV	Luke	9	52	He sent messengers on ahead . They went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him .
NIRV	Luke	9	53	But the people there did not welcome Jesus . That was because he was heading for Jerusalem .
NIRV	Luke	9	54	The disciples James and John saw this . They asked , “ Lord , do you want us to call down fire from heaven to destroy them ? ”
NIRV	Luke	9	55	But Jesus turned and commanded them not to do it .
NIRV	Luke	9	56	Then Jesus and his disciples went on to another village . The Cost of Following Jesus
NIRV	Luke	9	57	Once Jesus and those who were with him were walking along the road . A man said to Jesus , “ I will follow you no matter where you go. ”
NIRV	Luke	9	58	Jesus replied , “ Foxes have dens . Birds have nests . But the Son of Man has no place to lay his head. ”
NIRV	Luke	9	59	He said to another man , “ Follow me. ” But the man replied , “ Lord , first let me go and bury my father. ”
NIRV	Luke	9	60	Jesus said to him , “ Let dead people bury their own dead . You go and tell others about God ’ s kingdom. ”
NIRV	Luke	9	61	Still another person said , “ I will follow you , Lord . But first let me go back and say goodbye to my family. ”
NIRV	Luke	9	62	Jesus replied , “ Suppose someone starts to plow and then looks back . That person is not fit for service in God ’ s kingdom. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Luke	10	10	But what if you enter a town and are not welcomed ? Then go into its streets and say ,
NIRV	Luke	10	72	returned with joy . They said , “ Lord , even the demons obey us when we speak in your name. ”
NIRV	Luke	10	2	He told them , “ The harvest is huge , but the workers are few . So ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest field .
NIRV	Luke	10	3	Go ! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves .
NIRV	Luke	10	4	Do not take a purse or bag or sandals . And don ’ t greet anyone on the road .
NIRV	Luke	10	5	“ When you enter a house , first say , ‘ May this house be blessed with peace. ’
NIRV	Luke	10	6	If someone there works to bring peace , your blessing of peace will rest on them . If not , it will return to you .
NIRV	Luke	10	7	Stay there , and eat and drink anything they give you . Workers are worthy of their pay . Do not move around from house to house .
NIRV	Luke	10	8	“ When you enter a town and are welcomed , eat what is given to you .
NIRV	Luke	10	9	Heal the sick people who are there . Tell them , ‘ God ’ s kingdom has come near to you. ’
NIRV	Luke	10	11	‘ We wipe from our feet even the dust of your town . We do it to warn you . But here is what you can be sure of . God ’ s kingdom has come near. ’
NIRV	Luke	10	12	I tell you this . On judgment day it will be easier for Sodom than for that town .
NIRV	Luke	10	13	“ How terrible it will be for you , Chorazin ! How terrible for you , Bethsaida ! Suppose the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon . They would have turned away from their sins long ago . They would have put on the rough clothing people wear when they ’ re sad . They would have sat down in ashes .
NIRV	Luke	10	14	On judgment day it will be easier for Tyre and Sidon than for you .
NIRV	Luke	10	15	And what about you , Capernaum ? Will you be lifted up to the heavens ? No ! You will go down to the place of the dead .
NIRV	Luke	10	16	“ Whoever listens to you listens to me . Whoever does not accept you does not accept me . But whoever does not accept me does not accept the one who sent me. ”
NIRV	Luke	10	17	The
NIRV	Luke	10	18	Jesus replied , “ I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven .
NIRV	Luke	10	19	I have given you authority to walk all over snakes and scorpions . You will be able to destroy all the power of the enemy . Nothing will harm you .
NIRV	Luke	10	20	But do not be glad when the evil spirits obey you . Instead , be glad that your names are written in heaven. ”
NIRV	Luke	10	21	At that time Jesus was full of joy through the Holy Spirit . He said , “ I praise you , Father . You are Lord of heaven and earth . You have hidden these things from wise and educated people . But you have shown them to little children . Yes , Father . This is what you wanted to do .
NIRV	Luke	10	22	“ My Father has given all things to me . The Father is the only one who knows who the Son is . And the only ones who know the Father are the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to make the Father known. ”
NIRV	Luke	10	23	Then Jesus turned to his disciples . He said to them in private , “ Blessed are the eyes that see what you see .
NIRV	Luke	10	24	I tell you , many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see . But they didn ’ t see it . They wanted to hear what you hear . But they didn ’ t hear it. ” The Story of the Good Samaritan
NIRV	Luke	10	25	One day an authority on the law stood up to test Jesus . “ Teacher , ” he asked , “ what must I do to receive eternal life ? ”
NIRV	Luke	10	26	“ What is written in the Law ? ” Jesus replied . “ How do you understand it ? ”
NIRV	Luke	10	27	He answered , “ ‘ Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul . Love him with all your strength and with all your mind. ’ ( Deuteronomy 6:5 ) And , ‘ Love your neighbor as you love yourself. ’ ” ( Leviticus 19:18 )
NIRV	Luke	10	28	“ You have answered correctly , ” Jesus replied . “ Do that , and you will live. ”
NIRV	Luke	10	29	But the man wanted to make himself look good . So he asked Jesus , “ And who is my neighbor ? ”
NIRV	Luke	10	30	Jesus replied , “ A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho . Robbers attacked him . They stripped off his clothes and beat him . Then they went away , leaving him almost dead .
NIRV	Luke	10	31	A priest happened to be going down that same road . When he saw the man , he passed by on the other side .
NIRV	Luke	10	32	A Levite also came by . When he saw the man , he passed by on the other side too .
NIRV	Luke	10	33	But a Samaritan came to the place where the man was . When he saw the man , he felt sorry for him .
NIRV	Luke	10	34	He went to him , poured olive oil and wine on his wounds and bandaged them . Then he put the man on his own donkey . He brought him to an inn and took care of him .
NIRV	Luke	10	35	The next day he took out two silver coins . He gave them to the owner of the inn . ‘ Take care of him , ’ he said . ‘ When I return , I will pay you back for any extra expense you may have. ’
NIRV	Luke	10	36	“ Which of the three do you think was a neighbor to the man who was attacked by robbers ? ”
NIRV	Luke	10	37	The authority on the law replied , “ The one who felt sorry for him. ” Jesus told him , “ Go and do as he did. ” Jesus at the Home of Martha and Mary
NIRV	Luke	10	38	Jesus and his disciples went on their way . Jesus came to a village where a woman named Martha lived . She welcomed him into her home .
NIRV	Luke	10	39	She had a sister named Mary . Mary sat at the Lord ’ s feet listening to what he said .
NIRV	Luke	10	40	But Martha was busy with all the things that had to be done . She came to Jesus and said , “ Lord , my sister has left me to do the work by myself . Don ’ t you care ? Tell her to help me ! ”
NIRV	Luke	10	41	“ Martha , Martha , ” the Lord answered . “ You are worried and upset about many things .
NIRV	Luke	10	42	But few things are needed . Really , only one thing is needed . Mary has chosen what is better . And it will not be taken away from her. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Luke	11	11	“ Fathers , suppose your son asks for a fish . Which of you will give him a snake instead ?
NIRV	Luke	11	2	Jesus said to them , “ When you pray , this is what you should say . “ ‘ Father , may your name be honored . May your kingdom come .
NIRV	Luke	11	3	Give us each day our daily bread .
NIRV	Luke	11	4	Forgive us our sins , as we also forgive everyone who sins against us . Keep us from falling into sin when we are tempted. ’ ”
NIRV	Luke	11	5	Then Jesus said to them , “ Suppose you have a friend . You go to him at midnight and say , ‘ Friend , lend me three loaves of bread .
NIRV	Luke	11	6	A friend of mine on a journey has come to stay with me . I have no food to give him. ’
NIRV	Luke	11	7	And suppose the one inside answers , ‘ Don ’ t bother me . The door is already locked . My children and I are in bed . I can ’ t get up and give you anything. ’
NIRV	Luke	11	8	I tell you , that person will not get up . And he won ’ t give you bread just because he is your friend . But because you keep bothering him , he will surely get up . He will give you as much as you need .
NIRV	Luke	11	9	“ So here is what I say to you . Ask , and it will be given to you . Search , and you will find . Knock , and the door will be opened to you .
NIRV	Luke	11	10	Everyone who asks will receive . The one who searches will find . And the door will be opened to the one who knocks .
NIRV	Luke	11	12	Or suppose he asks for an egg . Which of you will give him a scorpion ?
NIRV	Luke	11	13	Even though you are evil , you know how to give good gifts to your children . How much more will your Father who is in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ! ” Jesus and Beelzebul
NIRV	Luke	11	14	Jesus was driving out a demon . The man who had the demon could not speak . When the demon left , the man began to speak . The crowd was amazed .
NIRV	Luke	11	15	But some of them said , “ Jesus is driving out demons by the power of Beelzebul , the prince of demons. ”
NIRV	Luke	11	16	Others tested Jesus by asking for a sign from heaven .
NIRV	Luke	11	17	Jesus knew what they were thinking . So he said to them , “ Any kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed . A family that is divided against itself will fall .
NIRV	Luke	11	18	If Satan fights against himself , how can his kingdom stand ? I say this because of what you claim . You say I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebul .
NIRV	Luke	11	19	Suppose I do drive out demons with Beelzebul ’ s help . With whose help do your followers drive them out ? So then , they will be your judges .
NIRV	Luke	11	20	But suppose I drive out demons with the help of God ’ s powerful finger . Then God ’ s kingdom has come upon you .
NIRV	Luke	11	21	“ When a strong man is completely armed and guards his house , what he owns is safe .
NIRV	Luke	11	22	But when someone stronger attacks , he is overpowered . The attacker takes away the armor the man had trusted in . Then he divides up what he has stolen .
NIRV	Luke	11	23	“ Whoever is not with me is against me . And whoever does not gather with me scatters .
NIRV	Luke	11	24	“ What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a person ? It goes through dry areas looking for a place to rest . But it doesn ’ t find it . Then it says , ‘ I will return to the house I left. ’
NIRV	Luke	11	25	When it arrives there , it finds the house swept clean and put in order .
NIRV	Luke	11	26	Then the evil spirit goes and takes seven other spirits more evil than itself . They go in and live there . That person is worse off than before. ”
NIRV	Luke	11	27	As Jesus was saying these things , a woman in the crowd called out . She shouted , “ Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you. ”
NIRV	Luke	11	28	He replied , “ Instead , blessed are those who hear God ’ s word and obey it. ” The Sign of Jonah
NIRV	Luke	11	29	As the crowds grew larger , Jesus spoke to them . “ The people of today are evil , ” he said . “ They ask for a sign from God . But none will be given except the sign of Jonah .
NIRV	Luke	11	30	He was a sign from God to the people of Nineveh . In the same way , the Son of Man will be a sign from God to the people of today .
NIRV	Luke	11	31	The Queen of the South will stand up on judgment day with the people now living . And she will prove that they are guilty . She came from very far away to listen to Solomon ’ s wisdom . And now something more important than Solomon is here .
NIRV	Luke	11	32	The men of Nineveh will stand up on judgment day with the people now living . And the Ninevites will prove that those people are guilty . The men of Nineveh turned away from their sins when Jonah preached to them . And now something more important than Jonah is here . The Eye Is the Lamp of the Body
NIRV	Luke	11	33	“ No one lights a lamp and hides it . No one puts it under a bowl . Instead , they put a lamp on its stand . Then those who come in can see the light .
NIRV	Luke	11	34	Your eye is like a lamp for your body . Suppose your eyes are healthy . Then your whole body also is full of light . But suppose your eyes can ’ t see well . Then your body also is full of darkness .
NIRV	Luke	11	35	So make sure that the light inside you is not darkness .
NIRV	Luke	11	36	Suppose your whole body is full of light . And suppose no part of it is dark . Then your body will be full of light . It will be just as when a lamp shines its light on you. ” Six Warnings
NIRV	Luke	11	37	Jesus finished speaking . Then a Pharisee invited him to eat with him . So Jesus went in and took his place at the table .
NIRV	Luke	11	38	But the Pharisee was surprised . He noticed that Jesus did not wash before the meal .
NIRV	Luke	11	39	Then the Lord spoke to him . “ You Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish , ” he said . “ But inside you are full of greed and evil .
NIRV	Luke	11	40	You foolish people ! Didn ’ t the one who made the outside make the inside also ?
NIRV	Luke	11	41	Give freely to poor people to show what is inside you . Then everything will be clean for you .
NIRV	Luke	11	42	“ How terrible it will be for you Pharisees ! You give God a tenth of your garden plants , such as mint and rue . But you have forgotten to be fair and to love God . You should have practiced the last things without failing to do the first .
NIRV	Luke	11	43	“ How terrible for you Pharisees ! You love the most important seats in the synagogues . You love having people greet you with respect in the market .
NIRV	Luke	11	44	“ How terrible for you ! You are like graves that are not marked . People walk over them without knowing it. ”
NIRV	Luke	11	45	An authority on the law spoke to Jesus . He said , “ Teacher , when you say things like that , you say bad things about us too. ”
NIRV	Luke	11	46	Jesus replied , “ How terrible for you authorities on the law ! You put such heavy loads on people that they can hardly carry them . But you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them .
NIRV	Luke	11	47	“ How terrible for you ! You build tombs for the prophets . It was your people of long ago who killed them .
NIRV	Luke	11	48	So you show that you agree with what your people did long ago . They killed the prophets , and now you build the prophets ’ tombs .
NIRV	Luke	11	49	So God in his wisdom said , ‘ I will send prophets and apostles to them . They will kill some . And they will try to hurt others. ’
NIRV	Luke	11	50	So the people of today will be punished . They will pay for all the prophets ’ blood spilled since the world began .
NIRV	Luke	11	51	I mean from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah . He was killed between the altar and the temple . Yes , I tell you , the people of today will be punished for all these things .
NIRV	Luke	11	52	“ How terrible for you authorities on the law ! You have taken away the key to the door of knowledge . You yourselves have not entered . And you have stood in the way of those who were entering. ”
NIRV	Luke	11	53	When Jesus went outside , the Pharisees and the teachers of the law strongly opposed him . They threw a lot of questions at him .
NIRV	Luke	11	54	They set traps for him . They wanted to catch him in something he might say . Copyright ©

NIRV	Luke	12	12	The Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say. ” The Story of the Rich Fool
NIRV	Luke	12	2	Everything that is secret will be brought out into the open . Everything that is hidden will be uncovered .
NIRV	Luke	12	3	What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight . What you have whispered to someone behind closed doors will be shouted from the rooftops .
NIRV	Luke	12	4	“ My friends , listen to me . Don ’ t be afraid of those who kill the body but can ’ t do any more than that .
NIRV	Luke	12	5	I will show you whom you should be afraid of . Be afraid of the one who has the authority to throw you into hell after you have been killed . Yes , I tell you , be afraid of him .
NIRV	Luke	12	6	Aren ’ t five sparrows sold for two pennies ? But God does not forget even one of them .
NIRV	Luke	12	7	In fact , he even counts every hair on your head ! So don ’ t be afraid . You are worth more than many sparrows .
NIRV	Luke	12	8	“ What about someone who says in front of others that he knows me ? I tell you , the Son of Man will say in front of God ’ s angels that he knows that person .
NIRV	Luke	12	9	But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn ’ t know me ? I , the Son of Man , will say in front of God ’ s angels that I don ’ t know him .
NIRV	Luke	12	10	Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven . But anyone who speaks evil things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
NIRV	Luke	12	11	“ You will be brought before synagogues , rulers and authorities . But do not worry about how to stand up for yourselves or what to say .
NIRV	Luke	12	13	Someone in the crowd spoke to Jesus . “ Teacher , ” he said , “ tell my brother to divide the family property with me. ”
NIRV	Luke	12	14	Jesus replied , “ Friend , who made me a judge or umpire between you ? ”
NIRV	Luke	12	15	Then he said to them , “ Watch out ! Be on your guard against wanting to have more and more things . Life is not made up of how much a person has. ”
NIRV	Luke	12	16	Then Jesus told them a story . He said , “ A certain rich man ’ s land produced a very large crop .
NIRV	Luke	12	17	He thought to himself , ‘ What should I do ? I don ’ t have any place to store my crops. ’
NIRV	Luke	12	18	“ Then he said , ‘ This is what I ’ ll do . I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones . I will store my extra grain in them .
NIRV	Luke	12	19	I ’ ll say to myself , “ You have plenty of grain stored away for many years . Take life easy . Eat , drink and have a good time. ” ’
NIRV	Luke	12	20	“ But God said to him , ‘ You foolish man ! Tonight I will take your life away from you . Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself ? ’
NIRV	Luke	12	21	“ That is how it will be for whoever stores things away for themselves but is not rich in the sight of God. ” Do Not Worry
NIRV	Luke	12	22	Then Jesus spoke to his disciples . He said , “ I tell you , do not worry . Don ’ t worry about your life and what you will eat . And don ’ t worry about your body and what you will wear .
NIRV	Luke	12	23	There is more to life than eating . There are more important things for the body than clothes .
NIRV	Luke	12	24	Think about the ravens . They don ’ t plant or gather crops . They don ’ t have any barns at all . But God feeds them . You are worth much more than birds !
NIRV	Luke	12	25	Can you add even one hour to your life by worrying ?
NIRV	Luke	12	26	You can ’ t do that very little thing . So why worry about the rest ?
NIRV	Luke	12	27	“ Think about how the wild flowers grow . They don ’ t work or make clothing . But here is what I tell you . Not even Solomon in his royal robes was dressed like one of those flowers .
NIRV	Luke	12	28	If that is how God dresses the wild grass , how much better will he dress you ! After all , the grass is here only today . Tomorrow it is thrown into the fire . Your faith is so small !
NIRV	Luke	12	29	Don ’ t spend time thinking about what you will eat or drink . Don ’ t worry about it .
NIRV	Luke	12	30	People who are ungodly run after all those things . Your Father knows that you need them .
NIRV	Luke	12	31	But put God ’ s kingdom first . Then those other things will also be given to you .
NIRV	Luke	12	32	“ Little flock , do not be afraid . Your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom .
NIRV	Luke	12	33	Sell what you own . Give to those who are poor . Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out . Store up riches in heaven that will never be used up . There , no thief can come near it . There , no moth can destroy it .
NIRV	Luke	12	34	Your heart will be where your riches are . Be Ready
NIRV	Luke	12	35	“ Be dressed and ready to serve . Keep your lamps burning .
NIRV	Luke	12	36	Be like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding dinner . When he comes and knocks , they can open the door for him at once .
NIRV	Luke	12	37	It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready when he comes . What I ’ m about to tell you is true . The master will then dress himself so he can serve them . He will have them take their places at the table . And he will come and wait on them .
NIRV	Luke	12	38	It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready . It will even be good if he comes in the middle of the night or toward morning .
NIRV	Luke	12	39	But here is what you must understand . Suppose the owner of the house knew at what hour the robber was coming . He would not have let his house be broken into .
NIRV	Luke	12	40	You also must be ready . The Son of Man will come at an hour when you don ’ t expect him. ”
NIRV	Luke	12	41	Peter asked , “ Lord , are you telling this story to us , or to everyone ? ”
NIRV	Luke	12	42	The Lord answered , “ Suppose a master puts one of his servants in charge of his other servants . The servant ’ s job is to give them the food they are to receive at the right time . The master wants a faithful and wise manager for this .
NIRV	Luke	12	43	It will be good for the servant if the master finds him doing his job when the master returns .
NIRV	Luke	12	44	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . The master will put that servant in charge of everything he owns .
NIRV	Luke	12	45	But suppose the servant says to himself , ‘ My master is taking a long time to come back. ’ Suppose that servant begins to beat the other servants , both men and women . Suppose he feeds himself . And suppose he drinks until he gets drunk .
NIRV	Luke	12	46	The master of that servant will come back on a day the servant doesn ’ t expect him . The master will return at an hour the servant doesn ’ t know . Then the master will cut him to pieces . He will send the servant to the place where unbelievers go .
NIRV	Luke	12	47	“ Suppose a servant knows the master ’ s wishes . But the servant doesn ’ t get ready and doesn ’ t do what the master wants . Then that servant will receive a heavy beating .
NIRV	Luke	12	48	But suppose the servant does not know his master ’ s wishes . And suppose the servant does things for which he should be punished . He will receive a lighter beating . Much will be required of everyone who has been given much . Even more will be asked of the person who is supposed to take care of much . Jesus Will Separate People From One Another
NIRV	Luke	12	49	“ I have come to bring fire on the earth . How I wish the fire had already started !
NIRV	Luke	12	50	But I have a baptism of suffering to go through . And I must go through it .
NIRV	Luke	12	51	Do you think I came to bring peace on earth ? No , I tell you . I have come to separate people .
NIRV	Luke	12	52	From now on there will be five members in a family , each one against the other . There will be three against two and two against three .
NIRV	Luke	12	53	They will be separated . Father will turn against son and son against father . Mother will turn against daughter and daughter against mother . Mother-in-law will turn against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law. ” Understanding the Meaning of What Is Happening
NIRV	Luke	12	54	Jesus spoke to the crowd . He said , “ You see a cloud rising in the west . Right away you say , ‘ It ’ s going to rain. ’ And it does .
NIRV	Luke	12	55	The south wind blows . So you say , ‘ It ’ s going to be hot. ’ And it is .
NIRV	Luke	12	56	You pretenders ! You know how to understand the appearance of the earth and the sky . Why can ’ t you understand the meaning of what is happening right now ?
NIRV	Luke	12	57	“ Why don ’ t you judge for yourselves what is right ?
NIRV	Luke	12	58	Suppose someone has a claim against you , and you are on your way to court . Try hard to settle the matter on the way . If you don ’ t , that person may drag you off to the judge . The judge may turn you over to the officer . And the officer may throw you into prison .

NIRV	Luke	13	13	Then he put his hands on her . Right away she stood up straight and praised God .
NIRV	Luke	13	2	Jesus said , “ These people from Galilee suffered greatly . Do you think they were worse sinners than all the other Galileans ?
NIRV	Luke	13	3	I tell you , no ! But unless you turn away from your sins , you will all die too .

NIRV	Luke	13	5	I tell you , no ! But unless you turn away from your sins , you will all die too. ”
NIRV	Luke	13	6	Then Jesus told a story . “ A man had a fig tree , ” he said . “ It was growing in his vineyard . When he went to look for fruit on it , he didn ’ t find any .
NIRV	Luke	13	7	So he went to the man who took care of the vineyard . He said , ‘ For three years now I ’ ve been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree . But I haven ’ t found any . Cut it down ! Why should it use up the soil ? ’
NIRV	Luke	13	8	“ ‘ Sir , ’ the man replied , ‘ leave it alone for one more year . I ’ ll dig around it and feed it .
NIRV	Luke	13	9	If it bears fruit next year , fine ! If not , then cut it down. ’ ” Jesus Heals a Disabled Woman on the Sabbath Day
NIRV	Luke	13	10	Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on a Sabbath day .
NIRV	Luke	13	11	A woman there had been disabled by an evil spirit for
NIRV	Luke	13	12	Jesus saw her . He asked her to come to him . He said to her , “ Woman , you will no longer be disabled . I am about to set you free. ”
NIRV	Luke	13	14	Jesus had healed the woman on the Sabbath day . This made the synagogue leader angry . He told the people , “ There are six days for work . So come and be healed on those days . But do not come on the Sabbath day. ”
NIRV	Luke	13	15	The Lord answered him , “ You pretenders ! Doesn ’ t each of you go to the barn and untie your ox or donkey on the Sabbath day ? Then don ’ t you lead it out to give it water ?
NIRV	Luke	13	16	This woman is a member of Abraham ’ s family line . But Satan has kept her disabled for
NIRV	Luke	13	17	When Jesus said this , all those who opposed him were put to shame . But the people were delighted . They loved all the wonderful things he was doing . The Stories of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast
NIRV	Luke	13	19	It is like a mustard seed . Someone took the seed and planted it in a garden . It grew and became a tree . The birds sat in its branches. ”
NIRV	Luke	13	20	Again he asked , “ What can I compare God ’ s kingdom to ?
NIRV	Luke	13	21	It is like yeast that a woman used . She mixed it into
NIRV	Luke	13	60	pounds of flour . The yeast worked its way all through the dough. ” The Narrow Door
NIRV	Luke	13	22	Then Jesus went through the towns and villages , teaching the people . He was on his way to Jerusalem .
NIRV	Luke	13	23	Someone asked him , “ Lord , are only a few people going to be saved ? ” He said to them ,
NIRV	Luke	13	24	“ Try very hard to enter through the narrow door . I tell you , many will try to enter and will not be able to .
NIRV	Luke	13	25	The owner of the house will get up and close the door . Then you will stand outside knocking and begging . You will say , ‘ Sir , open the door for us. ’ “ But he will answer , ‘ I don ’ t know you . And I don ’ t know where you come from. ’
NIRV	Luke	13	26	“ Then you will say , ‘ We ate and drank with you . You taught in our streets. ’
NIRV	Luke	13	27	“ But he will reply , ‘ I don ’ t know you . And I don ’ t know where you come from . Get away from me , all you who do evil ! ’
NIRV	Luke	13	28	“ You will weep and grind your teeth together when you see those who are in God ’ s kingdom . You will see Abraham , Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets there . But you yourselves will be thrown out .
NIRV	Luke	13	29	People will come from east and west and north and south . They will take their places at the feast in God ’ s kingdom .
NIRV	Luke	13	30	Then the last will be first . And the first will be last. ” Jesus ’ Sadness Over Jerusalem
NIRV	Luke	13	31	At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus . They said to him , “ Leave this place . Go somewhere else . Herod wants to kill you. ”
NIRV	Luke	13	32	He replied , “ Go and tell that fox , ‘ I will keep on driving out demons . I will keep on healing people today and tomorrow . And on the third day I will reach my goal. ’
NIRV	Luke	13	33	In any case , I must keep going today and tomorrow and the next day . Certainly no prophet can die outside Jerusalem !
NIRV	Luke	13	34	“ Jerusalem ! Jerusalem ! You kill the prophets and throw stones in order to kill those who are sent to you . Many times I have wanted to gather your people together . I have wanted to be like a hen who gathers her chicks under her wings . And you would not let me .

NIRV	Luke	14	2	In front of him was a man whose body was badly swollen .
NIRV	Luke	14	3	Jesus turned to the Pharisees and the authorities on the law . He asked them , “ Is it breaking the Law to heal on the Sabbath day ? ”
NIRV	Luke	14	4	But they remained silent . So Jesus took hold of the man and healed him . Then he sent him away .
NIRV	Luke	14	5	He asked them another question . He said , “ Suppose one of you has a child or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day . Wouldn ’ t you pull it out right away ? ”
NIRV	Luke	14	6	And they had nothing to say .
NIRV	Luke	14	7	Jesus noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table . So he told them a story .
NIRV	Luke	14	8	He said , “ Suppose someone invites you to a wedding feast . Do not take the place of honor . A person more important than you may have been invited .
NIRV	Luke	14	9	If so , the host who invited both of you will come to you . He will say , ‘ Give this person your seat. ’ Then you will be filled with shame . You will have to take the least important place .
NIRV	Luke	14	10	But when you are invited , take the lowest place . Then your host will come over to you . He will say , ‘ Friend , move up to a better place. ’ Then you will be honored in front of all the other guests .
NIRV	Luke	14	11	All those who lift themselves up will be made humble . And those who make themselves humble will be lifted up. ”
NIRV	Luke	14	12	Then Jesus spoke to his host . “ Suppose you give a lunch or a dinner , ” he said . “ Do not invite your friends , your brothers or sisters , or your relatives , or your rich neighbors . If you do , they may invite you to eat with them . So you will be paid back .
NIRV	Luke	14	13	But when you give a banquet , invite those who are poor . Also invite those who can ’ t see or walk .
NIRV	Luke	14	15	One of the people at the table with Jesus heard him say those things . So he said to Jesus , “ Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in God ’ s kingdom. ”
NIRV	Luke	14	16	Jesus replied , “ A certain man was preparing a great banquet . He invited many guests .
NIRV	Luke	14	17	Then the day of the banquet arrived . He sent his servant to those who had been invited . The servant told them , ‘ Come . Everything is ready now. ’
NIRV	Luke	14	18	“ But they all had the same idea . They began to make excuses . The first one said , ‘ I have just bought a field . I have to go and see it . Please excuse me. ’
NIRV	Luke	14	19	“ Another said , ‘ I have just bought five pairs of oxen . I ’ m on my way to try them out . Please excuse me. ’
NIRV	Luke	14	20	“ Still another said , ‘ I just got married , so I can ’ t come. ’
NIRV	Luke	14	21	“ The servant came back and reported this to his master . Then the owner of the house became angry . He ordered his servant , ‘ Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the town . Bring in those who are poor . Also bring those who can ’ t see or walk. ’
NIRV	Luke	14	22	“ ‘ Sir , ’ the servant said , ‘ what you ordered has been done . But there is still room. ’
NIRV	Luke	14	23	“ Then the master told his servant , ‘ Go out to the roads . Go out to the country lanes . Make the people come in . I want my house to be full .
NIRV	Luke	14	24	I tell you , not one of those people who were invited will get a taste of my banquet. ’ ” The Cost of Being a Disciple
NIRV	Luke	14	25	Large crowds were traveling with Jesus . He turned and spoke to them . He said ,
NIRV	Luke	14	26	“ Anyone who comes to me must hate their father and mother . They must hate their wife and children . They must hate their brothers and sisters . And they must hate even their own life . Unless they do this , they can ’ t be my disciple .
NIRV	Luke	14	27	Whoever doesn ’ t carry their cross and follow me can ’ t be my disciple .
NIRV	Luke	14	28	“ Suppose one of you wants to build a tower . Won ’ t you sit down first and figure out how much it will cost ? Then you will see whether you have enough money to finish it .
NIRV	Luke	14	29	Suppose you start building and are not able to finish . Then everyone who sees what you have done will laugh at you .
NIRV	Luke	14	30	They will say , ‘ This person started to build but wasn ’ t able to finish. ’
NIRV	Luke	14	31	“ Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king . And suppose he has 10,000 men , while the other has 20,000 coming against him . Won ’ t he first sit down and think about whether he can win ?
NIRV	Luke	14	32	And suppose he decides he can ’ t win . Then he will send some men to ask how peace can be made . He will do this while the other king is still far away .
NIRV	Luke	14	33	In the same way , you must give up everything you have . Those of you who don ’ t can not be my disciple .
NIRV	Luke	14	34	“ Salt is good . But suppose it loses its saltiness . How can it be made salty again ?
NIRV	Luke	14	35	It is not good for the soil . And it is not good for the trash pile . It will be thrown out . “ Whoever has ears should listen. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Luke	15	15	He went to work for someone who lived in that country . That person sent the son to the fields to feed the pigs .
NIRV	Luke	15	2	But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were whispering among themselves . They said , “ This man welcomes sinners and eats with them. ”
NIRV	Luke	15	3	Then Jesus told them a story .
NIRV	Luke	15	4	He said , “ Suppose one of you has
NIRV	Luke	15	100	sheep and loses one of them . Won ’ t he leave the

NIRV	Luke	15	5	When he finds it , he will joyfully put it on his shoulders
NIRV	Luke	15	6	and go home . Then he will call his friends and neighbors together . He will say , ‘ Be joyful with me . I have found my lost sheep. ’
NIRV	Luke	15	7	I tell you , it will be the same in heaven . There will be great joy when one sinner turns away from sin . Yes , there will be more joy than for
NIRV	Luke	15	8	“ Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one . Won ’ t she light a lamp and sweep the house ? Won ’ t she search carefully until she finds the coin ?

NIRV	Luke	15	10	I tell you , it is the same in heaven . There is joy in heaven over one sinner who turns away from sin. ” The Story of the Lost Son
NIRV	Luke	15	11	Jesus continued , “ There was a man who had two sons .
NIRV	Luke	15	12	The younger son spoke to his father . He said , ‘ Father , give me my share of the family property. ’ So the father divided his property between his two sons .
NIRV	Luke	15	13	“ Not long after that , the younger son packed up all he had . Then he left for a country far away . There he wasted his money on wild living .
NIRV	Luke	15	14	He spent everything he had . Then the whole country ran low on food . So the son didn ’ t have what he needed .
NIRV	Luke	15	16	The son wanted to fill his stomach with the food the pigs were eating . But no one gave him anything .
NIRV	Luke	15	17	“ Then he began to think clearly again . He said , ‘ How many of my father ’ s hired servants have more than enough food ! But here I am dying from hunger !
NIRV	Luke	15	18	I will get up and go back to my father . I will say to him , “ Father , I have sinned against heaven . And I have sinned against you .
NIRV	Luke	15	19	I am no longer fit to be called your son . Make me like one of your hired servants. ” ’
NIRV	Luke	15	20	So he got up and went to his father . “ While the son was still a long way off , his father saw him . He was filled with tender love for his son . He ran to him . He threw his arms around him and kissed him .
NIRV	Luke	15	21	“ The son said to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against heaven and against you . I am no longer fit to be called your son. ’
NIRV	Luke	15	22	“ But the father said to his servants , ‘ Quick ! Bring the best robe and put it on him . Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet .
NIRV	Luke	15	23	Bring the fattest calf and kill it . Let ’ s have a feast and celebrate .
NIRV	Luke	15	24	This son of mine was dead . And now he is alive again . He was lost . And now he is found. ’ So they began to celebrate .
NIRV	Luke	15	25	“ The older son was in the field . When he came near the house , he heard music and dancing .
NIRV	Luke	15	26	So he called one of the servants . He asked him what was going on .
NIRV	Luke	15	27	‘ Your brother has come home , ’ the servant replied . ‘ Your father has killed the fattest calf . He has done this because your brother is back safe and sound. ’
NIRV	Luke	15	28	“ The older brother became angry . He refused to go in . So his father went out and begged him .
NIRV	Luke	15	29	But he answered his father , ‘ Look ! All these years I ’ ve worked like a slave for you . I have always obeyed your orders . You never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends .
NIRV	Luke	15	30	But this son of yours wasted your money with some prostitutes . Now he comes home . And for him you kill the fattest calf ! ’
NIRV	Luke	15	31	“ ‘ My son , ’ the father said , ‘ you are always with me . Everything I have is yours .
NIRV	Luke	15	32	But we had to celebrate and be glad . This brother of yours was dead . And now he is alive again . He was lost . And now he is found. ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Luke	16	16	“ The teachings of the Law and the Prophets were preached until John the Baptist came . Since then , the good news of God ’ s kingdom is being preached . And everyone is trying very hard to enter it .
NIRV	Luke	16	2	So the rich man told him to come in . He asked him , ‘ What is this I hear about you ? Tell me exactly how you have handled what I own . You can ’ t be my manager any longer. ’
NIRV	Luke	16	3	“ The manager said to himself , ‘ What will I do now ? My master is taking away my job . I ’ m not strong enough to dig . And I ’ m too ashamed to beg .
NIRV	Luke	16	4	I know what I ’ m going to do . I ’ ll do something so that when I lose my job here , people will welcome me into their houses. ’
NIRV	Luke	16	5	“ So he called in each person who owed his master something . He asked the first one , ‘ How much do you owe my master ? ’
NIRV	Luke	16	6	“ ‘ I owe
NIRV	Luke	16	900	gallons of olive oil , ’ he replied . “ The manager told him , ‘ Take your bill . Sit down quickly and change it to
NIRV	Luke	16	450	gallons. ’
NIRV	Luke	16	7	“ Then he asked the second one , ‘ And how much do you owe ? ’ “ ‘ I owe 1,000 bushels of wheat , ’ he replied . “ The manager told him , ‘ Take your bill and change it to
NIRV	Luke	16	800	bushels. ’
NIRV	Luke	16	8	“ The manager had not been honest . But the master praised him for being clever . The people of this world are clever in dealing with those who are like themselves . They are more clever than God ’ s people .
NIRV	Luke	16	9	I tell you , use the riches of this world to help others . In that way , you will make friends for yourselves . Then when your riches are gone , you will be welcomed into your eternal home in heaven .
NIRV	Luke	16	10	“ Suppose you can be trusted with something very little . Then you can also be trusted with something very large . But suppose you are not honest with something very little . Then you will also not be honest with something very large .
NIRV	Luke	16	11	Suppose you have not been worthy of trust in handling worldly wealth . Then who will trust you with true riches ?
NIRV	Luke	16	12	Suppose you have not been worthy of trust in handling someone else ’ s property . Then who will give you property of your own ?
NIRV	Luke	16	13	“ No one can serve two masters at the same time . Either you will hate one of them and love the other . Or you will be faithful to one and dislike the other . You can ’ t serve God and money at the same time. ”
NIRV	Luke	16	14	The Pharisees loved money . They heard all that Jesus said and made fun of him .
NIRV	Luke	16	15	Jesus said to them , “ You try to make yourselves look good in the eyes of other people . But God knows your hearts . What people think is worth a lot is hated by God . More Teachings
NIRV	Luke	16	17	It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the smallest part of a letter to drop out of the Law .
NIRV	Luke	16	18	“ Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery . Also , the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery . The Rich Man and Lazarus
NIRV	Luke	16	19	“ Once there was a rich man . He was dressed in purple cloth and fine linen . He lived an easy life every day .
NIRV	Luke	16	20	A man named Lazarus was placed at his gate . Lazarus was a beggar . His body was covered with sores .
NIRV	Luke	16	21	Even dogs came and licked his sores . All he wanted was to eat what fell from the rich man ’ s table .
NIRV	Luke	16	22	“ The time came when the beggar died . The angels carried him to Abraham ’ s side . The rich man also died and was buried .
NIRV	Luke	16	23	In the place of the dead , the rich man was suffering terribly . He looked up and saw Abraham far away . Lazarus was by his side .
NIRV	Luke	16	24	So the rich man called out , ‘ Father Abraham ! Have pity on me ! Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water . Then he can cool my tongue with it . I am in terrible pain in this fire. ’
NIRV	Luke	16	25	“ But Abraham replied , ‘ Son , remember what happened in your lifetime . You received your good things . Lazarus received bad things . Now he is comforted here , and you are in terrible pain .
NIRV	Luke	16	26	Besides , a wide space has been placed between us and you . So those who want to go from here to you can ’ t go . And no one can cross over from there to us. ’
NIRV	Luke	16	27	“ The rich man answered , ‘ Then I beg you , father Abraham . Send Lazarus to my family .
NIRV	Luke	16	28	I have five brothers . Let Lazarus warn them . Then they will not come to this place of terrible suffering. ’
NIRV	Luke	16	29	“ Abraham replied , ‘ They have the teachings of Moses and the Prophets . Let your brothers listen to them. ’
NIRV	Luke	16	30	“ ‘ No , father Abraham , ’ he said . ‘ But if someone from the dead goes to them , they will turn away from their sins. ’
NIRV	Luke	16	31	“ Abraham said to him , ‘ They do not listen to Moses and the Prophets . So they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead. ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Luke	17	17	Jesus asked , “ Weren ’ t all ten healed ? Where are the other nine ?
NIRV	Luke	17	2	Suppose people lead one of these little ones to sin . It would be better for those people to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck .
NIRV	Luke	17	3	So watch what you do . “ If your brother or sister sins against you , tell them they are wrong . Then if they turn away from their sins , forgive them .
NIRV	Luke	17	4	Suppose they sin against you seven times in one day . And suppose they come back to you each time and say , ‘ I ’ m sorry. ’ You must forgive them. ”
NIRV	Luke	17	5	The apostles said to the Lord , “ Give us more faith ! ”

NIRV	Luke	17	10	It ’ s the same with you . Suppose you have done everything you were told to do . Then you should say , ‘ We are not worthy to serve you . We have only done our duty. ’ ” Jesus Heals Ten Men Who Have a Skin Disease
NIRV	Luke	17	11	Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem . He traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee .
NIRV	Luke	17	12	As he was going into a village , ten men met him . They had a skin disease . They were standing close by .
NIRV	Luke	17	13	And they called out in a loud voice , “ Jesus ! Master ! Have pity on us ! ”
NIRV	Luke	17	14	Jesus saw them and said , “ Go . Show yourselves to the priests. ” While they were on the way , they were healed .
NIRV	Luke	17	15	When one of them saw that he was healed , he came back . He praised God in a loud voice .
NIRV	Luke	17	16	He threw himself at Jesus ’ feet and thanked him . The man was a Samaritan .
NIRV	Luke	17	18	Didn ’ t anyone else return and give praise to God except this outsider ? ”
NIRV	Luke	17	19	Then Jesus said to him , “ Get up and go . Your faith has healed you. ” The Coming of God ’ s Kingdom
NIRV	Luke	17	20	Once the Pharisees asked Jesus when God ’ s kingdom would come . He replied , “ The coming of God ’ s kingdom is not something you can see .
NIRV	Luke	17	21	People will not say , ‘ Here it is. ’ Or , ‘ There it is. ’ That ’ s because God ’ s kingdom is among you. ”
NIRV	Luke	17	22	Then Jesus spoke to his disciples . “ The time is coming , ” he said , “ when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man . But you won ’ t see it .
NIRV	Luke	17	23	People will tell you , ‘ There he is ! ’ Or , ‘ Here he is ! ’ Don ’ t go running off after them .
NIRV	Luke	17	24	When the Son of Man comes , he will be like the lightning . It flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other .
NIRV	Luke	17	25	But first the Son of Man must suffer many things . He will not be accepted by the people of today .
NIRV	Luke	17	26	“ Remember how it was in the days of Noah . It will be the same when the Son of Man comes .
NIRV	Luke	17	27	People were eating and drinking . They were getting married . They were giving their daughters to be married . They did all those things right up to the day Noah entered the ark . Then the flood came and destroyed them all .
NIRV	Luke	17	28	“ It was the same in the days of Lot . People were eating and drinking . They were buying and selling . They were planting and building .
NIRV	Luke	17	29	But on the day Lot left Sodom , fire and sulfur rained down from heaven . And all the people were destroyed .
NIRV	Luke	17	30	“ It will be just like that on the day the Son of Man is shown to the world .
NIRV	Luke	17	31	Suppose someone is on the housetop on that day . And suppose what they own is inside the house . They should not go down to get what they own . No one in the field should go back for anything either .
NIRV	Luke	17	32	Remember Lot ’ s wife !
NIRV	Luke	17	33	Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it . Whoever loses their life will keep it .
NIRV	Luke	17	34	I tell you , on that night two people will be in one bed . One person will be taken and the other left . 35-36 Two women will be grinding grain together . One will be taken and the other left. ”

NIRV	Luke	18	18	A certain ruler asked Jesus a question . “ Good teacher , ” he said , “ what must I do to receive eternal life ? ”
NIRV	Luke	18	2	He said , “ In a certain town there was a judge . He didn ’ t have any respect for God or care about what people thought .
NIRV	Luke	18	3	A widow lived in that town . She came to the judge again and again . She kept begging him , ‘ Make things right for me . Someone is treating me badly. ’
NIRV	Luke	18	4	“ For some time the judge refused . But finally he said to himself , ‘ I don ’ t have any respect for God . I don ’ t care about what people think .
NIRV	Luke	18	5	But this widow keeps bothering me . So I will see that things are made right for her . If I don ’ t , she will someday come and attack me ! ’ ”
NIRV	Luke	18	6	The Lord said , “ Listen to what the unfair judge says .
NIRV	Luke	18	7	God ’ s chosen people cry out to him day and night . Won ’ t he make things right for them ? Will he keep putting them off ?

NIRV	Luke	18	9	Jesus told a story to some people who were sure they were right with God . They looked down on everyone else .
NIRV	Luke	18	10	He said to them , “ Two men went up to the temple to pray . One was a Pharisee . The other was a tax collector .
NIRV	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed . ‘ God , I thank you that I am not like other people , ’ he said . ‘ I am not like robbers or those who do other evil things . I am not like those who commit adultery . I am not even like this tax collector .

NIRV	Luke	18	13	“ But the tax collector stood farther away than the Pharisee . He would not even look up to heaven . He brought his hand to his heart and prayed . He said , ‘ God , have mercy on me . I am a sinner. ’
NIRV	Luke	18	14	“ I tell you , the tax collector went home accepted by God . But not the Pharisee . All those who lift themselves up will be made humble . And those who make themselves humble will be lifted up. ” Little Children Are Brought to Jesus
NIRV	Luke	18	15	People were also bringing babies to Jesus . They wanted him to place his hands on the babies . When the disciples saw this , they told the people to stop .
NIRV	Luke	18	16	But Jesus asked the children to come to him . “ Let the little children come to me , ” he said . “ Don ’ t keep them away . God ’ s kingdom belongs to people like them .
NIRV	Luke	18	17	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . Anyone who will not receive God ’ s kingdom like a little child will never enter it. ” Rich People and the Kingdom of God
NIRV	Luke	18	19	“ Why do you call me good ? ” Jesus answered . “ No one is good except God .
NIRV	Luke	18	20	You know what the commandments say . ‘ Do not commit adultery . Do not commit murder . Do not steal . Do not be a false witness . Honor your father and mother. ’ ” ( Exodus 20:12–16 ; Deuteronomy 5:16–20 )
NIRV	Luke	18	21	“ I have obeyed all those commandments since I was a boy , ” the ruler said .
NIRV	Luke	18	22	When Jesus heard this , he said to him , “ You are still missing one thing . Sell everything you have . Give the money to those who are poor . You will have treasure in heaven . Then come and follow me. ”
NIRV	Luke	18	23	When the ruler heard this , he became very sad . He was very rich .
NIRV	Luke	18	24	Jesus looked at him . Then he said , “ How hard it is for rich people to enter God ’ s kingdom !
NIRV	Luke	18	25	Is it hard for a camel to go through the eye of a needle ? It is even harder for someone who is rich to enter God ’ s kingdom ! ”
NIRV	Luke	18	26	Those who heard this asked , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
NIRV	Luke	18	27	Jesus replied , “ Things that are impossible with people are possible with God. ”
NIRV	Luke	18	28	Peter said to him , “ We have left everything we had in order to follow you ! ”
NIRV	Luke	18	29	“ What I ’ m about to tell you is true , ” Jesus said to them . “ Has anyone left home or wife or husband or brothers or sisters or parents or children for God ’ s kingdom ?

NIRV	Luke	18	33	They will whip him and kill him . On the third day , he will rise from the dead ! ”

NIRV	Luke	18	35	Jesus was approaching Jericho . A blind man was sitting by the side of the road begging .
NIRV	Luke	18	36	The blind man heard the crowd going by . He asked what was happening .
NIRV	Luke	18	37	They told him , “ Jesus of Nazareth is passing by. ”
NIRV	Luke	18	38	So the blind man called out , “ Jesus ! Son of David ! Have mercy on me ! ”
NIRV	Luke	18	39	Those who led the way commanded him to stop . They told him to be quiet . But he shouted even louder , “ Son of David ! Have mercy on me ! ”

NIRV	Luke	18	41	“ What do you want me to do for you ? ” Jesus asked . “ Lord , I want to be able to see , ” the blind man replied .
NIRV	Luke	18	42	Jesus said to him , “ Receive your sight . Your faith has healed you. ”

NIRV	Luke	19	19	“ His master answered , ‘ I will put you in charge of five towns. ’
NIRV	Luke	19	2	A man named Zacchaeus lived there . He was a chief tax collector and was very rich .
NIRV	Luke	19	3	Zacchaeus wanted to see who Jesus was . But he was a short man . He could not see Jesus because of the crowd .
NIRV	Luke	19	4	So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree . He wanted to see Jesus , who was coming that way .
NIRV	Luke	19	5	Jesus reached the spot where Zacchaeus was . He looked up and said , “ Zacchaeus , come down at once . I must stay at your house today. ”
NIRV	Luke	19	6	So Zacchaeus came down at once and welcomed him gladly .
NIRV	Luke	19	7	All the people saw this . They began to whisper among themselves . They said , “ Jesus has gone to be the guest of a sinner . ”
NIRV	Luke	19	8	But Zacchaeus stood up . He said , “ Look , Lord ! Here and now I give half of what I own to those who are poor . And if I have cheated anybody out of anything , I will pay it back . I will pay back four times the amount I took. ”

NIRV	Luke	19	11	While the people were listening to these things , Jesus told them a story . He was near Jerusalem . The people thought that God ’ s kingdom was going to appear right away .
NIRV	Luke	19	12	Jesus said , “ A man from an important family went to a country far away . He went there to be made king and then return home .
NIRV	Luke	19	13	So he sent for ten of his slaves . He gave them each about three months ’ pay . ‘ Put this money to work until I come back , ’ he said .
NIRV	Luke	19	14	“ But those he ruled over hated him . They sent some messengers after him . They were sent to say , ‘ We don ’ t want this man to be our king. ’
NIRV	Luke	19	15	“ But he was made king and returned home . Then he sent for the slaves he had given the money to . He wanted to find out what they had earned with it .
NIRV	Luke	19	16	“ The first one came to him . He said , ‘ Sir , your money has earned ten times as much. ’
NIRV	Luke	19	17	“ ‘ You have done well , my good slave ! ’ his master replied . ‘ You have been faithful in a very small matter . So I will put you in charge of ten towns. ’
NIRV	Luke	19	18	“ The second slave came to his master . He said , ‘ Sir , your money has earned five times as much. ’
NIRV	Luke	19	20	“ Then another slave came . He said , ‘ Sir , here is your money . I have kept it hidden in a piece of cloth .
NIRV	Luke	19	21	I was afraid of you . You are a hard man . You take out what you did not put in . You harvest what you did not plant. ’
NIRV	Luke	19	22	“ His master replied , ‘ I will judge you by your own words , you evil slave ! So you knew that I am a hard man ? You knew that I take out what I did not put in ? You knew that I harvest what I did not plant ?
NIRV	Luke	19	23	Then why didn ’ t you put my money in the bank ? When I came back , I could have collected it with interest. ’
NIRV	Luke	19	24	“ Then he said to those standing by , ‘ Take his money away from him . Give it to the one who has ten times as much. ’
NIRV	Luke	19	25	“ ‘ Sir , ’ they said , ‘ he already has ten times as much ! ’
NIRV	Luke	19	26	“ He replied , ‘ I tell you that everyone who has will be given more . But here is what will happen to anyone who has nothing . Even what they have will be taken away from them .
NIRV	Luke	19	27	And what about my enemies who did not want me to be king over them ? Bring them here ! Kill them in front of me ! ’ ” Jesus Comes to Jerusalem as King
NIRV	Luke	19	28	After Jesus had said this , he went on ahead . He was going up to Jerusalem .
NIRV	Luke	19	29	He approached Bethphage and Bethany . The hill there was called the Mount of Olives . Jesus sent out two of his disciples . He said to them ,
NIRV	Luke	19	30	“ Go to the village ahead of you . As soon as you get there , you will find a donkey ’ s colt tied up . No one has ever ridden it . Untie it and bring it here .
NIRV	Luke	19	31	Someone may ask you , ‘ Why are you untying it ? ’ If so , say , ‘ The Lord needs it. ’ ”
NIRV	Luke	19	32	Those who were sent ahead went and found the young donkey . It was there just as Jesus had told them .
NIRV	Luke	19	33	They were untying the colt when its owners came . The owners asked them , “ Why are you untying the colt ? ”
NIRV	Luke	19	34	They replied , “ The Lord needs it. ”
NIRV	Luke	19	35	Then the disciples brought the colt to Jesus . They threw their coats on the young donkey and put Jesus on it .
NIRV	Luke	19	36	As he went along , people spread their coats on the road .
NIRV	Luke	19	37	Jesus came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives . There the whole crowd of disciples began to praise God with joy . In loud voices they praised him for all the miracles they had seen . They shouted ,
NIRV	Luke	19	38	“ Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord ! ” ( Psalm 118:26 ) “ May there be peace and glory in the highest heaven ! ”
NIRV	Luke	19	39	Some of the Pharisees in the crowd spoke to Jesus . “ Teacher , ” they said , “ tell your disciples to stop ! ”
NIRV	Luke	19	40	“ I tell you , ” he replied , “ if they keep quiet , the stones will cry out. ”
NIRV	Luke	19	41	He approached Jerusalem . When he saw the city , he began to weep .
NIRV	Luke	19	42	He said , “ I wish you had known today what would bring you peace ! But now it is hidden from your eyes .
NIRV	Luke	19	43	The days will come when your enemies will arrive . They will build a wall of dirt up against your city . They will surround you and close you in on every side .
NIRV	Luke	19	44	You didn ’ t recognize the time when God came to you . So your enemies will smash you to the ground . They will destroy you and all the people inside your walls . They will not leave one stone on top of another. ” Jesus Clears Out the Temple
NIRV	Luke	19	45	Then Jesus entered the temple courtyard . He began to drive out those who were selling there .
NIRV	Luke	19	46	He told them , “ It is written that the Lord said , ‘ My house will be a house where people can pray. ’ ( Isaiah 56:7 ) But you have made it a ‘ den for robbers. ’ ” ( Jeremiah 7:11 )
NIRV	Luke	19	47	Every day Jesus was teaching at the temple . But the chief priests and the teachers of the law were trying to kill him . So were the leaders among the people .

NIRV	Luke	20	20	The religious leaders sent spies to keep a close watch on Jesus . The spies pretended to be sincere . They hoped they could trap Jesus with something he would say . Then they could hand him over to the power and authority of the governor .
NIRV	Luke	20	2	“ Tell us by what authority you are doing these things , ” they all said . “ Who gave you this authority ? ”
NIRV	Luke	20	3	Jesus replied , “ I will also ask you a question . Tell me ,
NIRV	Luke	20	4	was John ’ s baptism from heaven ? Or did it come from people ? ”
NIRV	Luke	20	5	They talked to one another about it . They said , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ he will ask , ‘ Why didn ’ t you believe him ? ’
NIRV	Luke	20	6	But if we say , ‘ From people , ’ all the people will throw stones at us and kill us . They believe that John was a prophet. ”
NIRV	Luke	20	7	So they answered Jesus , “ We don ’ t know where John ’ s baptism came from. ”
NIRV	Luke	20	8	Jesus said , “ Then I won ’ t tell you by what authority I am doing these things either. ” The Story of the Renters
NIRV	Luke	20	9	Jesus went on to tell the people a story . “ A man planted a vineyard , ” he said . “ He rented it out to some farmers . Then he went away for a long time .
NIRV	Luke	20	10	At harvest time he sent a slave to the renters . They were supposed to give him some of the fruit of the vineyard . But the renters beat the slave . Then they sent him away with nothing .
NIRV	Luke	20	11	So the man sent another slave . They beat that one and treated him badly . They also sent him away with nothing .
NIRV	Luke	20	12	The man sent a third slave . The renters wounded him and threw him out .
NIRV	Luke	20	13	“ Then the owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What should I do ? I have a son , and I love him . I will send him . Maybe they will respect him. ’
NIRV	Luke	20	14	“ But when the renters saw the son , they talked the matter over . ‘ This is the one who will receive all the owner ’ s property someday , ’ they said . ‘ Let ’ s kill him . Then everything will be ours. ’
NIRV	Luke	20	15	So they threw him out of the vineyard . And they killed him . “ What will the owner of the vineyard do to the renters ?
NIRV	Luke	20	16	He will come and kill them . He will give the vineyard to others. ” When the people heard this , they said , “ We hope this never happens ! ”
NIRV	Luke	20	17	Jesus looked right at them and said , “ Here is something I want you to explain the meaning of . It is written , “ ‘ The stone the builders didn ’ t accept has become the most important stone of all. ’ ( Psalm 118:22 )
NIRV	Luke	20	18	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces . But the stone will crush anyone it falls on. ”
NIRV	Luke	20	19	The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest Jesus at once . They knew he had told that story against them . But they were afraid of the people . Is It Right to Pay the Royal Tax to Caesar ?
NIRV	Luke	20	21	So the spies questioned Jesus . “ Teacher , ” they said , “ we know that you speak and teach what is right . We know you don ’ t favor one person over another . You teach the way of God truthfully .
NIRV	Luke	20	22	Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ”
NIRV	Luke	20	23	Jesus saw they were trying to trick him . So he said to them ,
NIRV	Luke	20	24	“ Show me a silver coin . Whose picture and words are on it ? ” “ Caesar ’ s , ” they replied .
NIRV	Luke	20	25	He said to them , “ Then give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar . And give back to God what belongs to God. ”
NIRV	Luke	20	26	They were not able to trap him with what he had said there in front of all the people . Amazed by his answer , they became silent . Marriage When the Dead Rise
NIRV	Luke	20	27	The Sadducees do not believe that people rise from the dead . Some of them came to Jesus with a question .
NIRV	Luke	20	28	“ Teacher , ” they said , “ Moses wrote for us about a man ’ s brother who dies . Suppose the brother leaves a wife but has no children . Then the man must marry the widow . He must provide children to carry on his dead brother ’ s name .
NIRV	Luke	20	29	There were seven brothers . The first one married a woman . He died without leaving any children .
NIRV	Luke	20	30	The second one married her .
NIRV	Luke	20	31	And then the third one married her . One after another , the seven brothers married her . They all died . None left any children .
NIRV	Luke	20	32	Finally , the woman died too .
NIRV	Luke	20	33	Now then , when the dead rise , whose wife will she be ? All seven brothers were married to her. ”
NIRV	Luke	20	34	Jesus replied , “ People in this world get married . And their parents give them to be married .
NIRV	Luke	20	35	But it will not be like that when the dead rise . Those who are considered worthy to take part in the world to come won ’ t get married . And their parents won ’ t give them to be married .
NIRV	Luke	20	36	They can ’ t die anymore . They are like the angels . They are God ’ s children . They will be given a new form of life when the dead rise .
NIRV	Luke	20	37	Remember the story of Moses and the burning bush . Even Moses showed that the dead rise . The Lord said to him , ‘ I am the God of Abraham . I am the God of Isaac . And I am the God of Jacob. ’ ( Exodus 3:6 )
NIRV	Luke	20	38	He is not the God of the dead . He is the God of the living . In his eyes , everyone is alive. ”
NIRV	Luke	20	39	Some of the teachers of the law replied , “ You have spoken well , teacher ! ”
NIRV	Luke	20	40	And no one dared to ask him any more questions . Whose Son Is the Messiah ?
NIRV	Luke	20	41	Jesus said to them , “ Why do people say that the Messiah is the son of David ?
NIRV	Luke	20	42	David himself says in the Book of Psalms , “ ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at my right hand
NIRV	Luke	20	43	until I put your enemies under your control. ” ’ ( Psalm 110:1 )
NIRV	Luke	20	44	David calls him ‘ Lord. ’ So how can he be David ’ s son ? ” Warning Against the Teachers of the Law
NIRV	Luke	20	45	All the people were listening . Jesus said to his disciples ,
NIRV	Luke	20	46	“ Watch out for the teachers of the law . They like to walk around in long robes . They love to be greeted with respect in the market . They love to have the most important seats in the synagogues . They also love to have the places of honor at banquets .
NIRV	Luke	20	47	They take over the houses of widows . They say long prayers to show off . God will punish these men very much. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Luke	21	21	Those who are in Judea should then escape to the mountains . Those in the city should get out . Those in the country should not enter the city .
NIRV	Luke	21	2	He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins .
NIRV	Luke	21	3	“ What I ’ m about to tell you is true , ” Jesus said . “ That poor widow has put in more than all the others .
NIRV	Luke	21	4	All these other people gave a lot because they are rich . But even though she is poor , she put in everything . She had nothing left to live on. ” When the Temple Will Be Destroyed and the Signs of the End
NIRV	Luke	21	5	Some of Jesus ’ disciples were talking about the temple . They spoke about how it was decorated with beautiful stones and with gifts that honored God . But Jesus asked ,
NIRV	Luke	21	6	“ Do you see all this ? The time will come when not one stone will be left on top of another . Every stone will be thrown down. ”
NIRV	Luke	21	7	“ Teacher , ” they asked , “ when will these things happen ? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place ? ”
NIRV	Luke	21	8	Jesus replied , “ Keep watch ! Be careful that you are not fooled . Many will come in my name . They will claim , ‘ I am he ! ’ And they will say , ‘ The time is near ! ’ Do not follow them .
NIRV	Luke	21	9	Do not be afraid when you hear about wars and about fighting against rulers . Those things must happen first . But the end will not come right away. ”
NIRV	Luke	21	10	Then Jesus said to them , “ Nation will fight against nation . Kingdom will fight against kingdom .
NIRV	Luke	21	11	In many places there will be powerful earthquakes . People will go hungry . There will be terrible sicknesses . Things will happen that will make people afraid . There will be great and miraculous signs from heaven .
NIRV	Luke	21	12	“ But before all this , people will arrest you and treat you badly . They will hand you over to synagogues and put you in prison . You will be brought to kings and governors . All this will happen to you because of my name .

NIRV	Luke	21	20	“ A time is coming when you will see armies surround Jerusalem . Then you will know that it will soon be destroyed .
NIRV	Luke	21	22	This is the time when God will punish Jerusalem . Everything will come true , just as it has been written .
NIRV	Luke	21	23	How awful it will be in those days for pregnant women ! How awful for nursing mothers ! There will be terrible suffering in the land . There will be great anger against those people .
NIRV	Luke	21	24	Some will be killed by the sword . Others will be taken as prisoners to all the nations . Jerusalem will be taken over by Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles come to an end .
NIRV	Luke	21	25	“ There will be signs in the sun , moon and stars . The nations of the earth will be in terrible pain . They will be puzzled by the roaring and tossing of the sea .
NIRV	Luke	21	26	Terror will make people faint . They will be worried about what is happening in the world . The sun , moon and stars will be shaken from their places .
NIRV	Luke	21	27	At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud . He will come with power and great glory .
NIRV	Luke	21	28	When these things begin to take place , stand up . Hold your head up with joy and hope . The time when you will be set free will be very close. ”
NIRV	Luke	21	29	Jesus told them a story . “ Look at the fig tree and all the trees , ” he said .
NIRV	Luke	21	30	“ When you see leaves appear on the branches , you know that summer is near .

NIRV	Luke	22	22	The Son of Man will go to his death , just as God has already decided . But how terrible it will be for the one who hands him over ! ”
NIRV	Luke	22	2	The chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for a way to get rid of Jesus . They were afraid of the people .
NIRV	Luke	22	3	Then Satan entered Judas , who was called Iscariot . Judas was one of the
NIRV	Luke	22	12	disciples . Judas approached Jesus to kiss him .
NIRV	Luke	22	4	He went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard . He talked with them about how he could hand Jesus over to them .
NIRV	Luke	22	5	They were delighted and agreed to give him money .
NIRV	Luke	22	6	Judas accepted their offer . He watched for the right time to hand Jesus over to them . He wanted to do it when no crowd was around . The Last Supper
NIRV	Luke	22	7	Then the day of Unleavened Bread came . That was the time the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed .
NIRV	Luke	22	8	Jesus sent Peter and John on ahead . “ Go , ” he told them . “ Prepare for us to eat the Passover meal. ”
NIRV	Luke	22	9	“ Where do you want us to prepare for it ? ” they asked .
NIRV	Luke	22	10	Jesus replied , “ When you enter the city , a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him to the house he enters .
NIRV	Luke	22	11	Then say to the owner of the house , ‘ The Teacher asks , “ Where is the guest room ? Where can I eat the Passover meal with my disciples ? ” ’
NIRV	Luke	22	13	Peter and John left . They found things just as Jesus had told them . So they prepared the Passover meal .
NIRV	Luke	22	14	When the hour came , Jesus and his apostles took their places at the table .
NIRV	Luke	22	15	He said to them , “ I have really looked forward to eating this Passover meal with you . I wanted to do this before I suffer .
NIRV	Luke	22	16	I tell you , I will not eat the Passover meal again until it is celebrated in God ’ s kingdom. ”
NIRV	Luke	22	17	After Jesus took the cup , he gave thanks . He said , “ Take this cup and share it among yourselves .
NIRV	Luke	22	18	I tell you , I will not drink wine with you again until God ’ s kingdom comes. ”
NIRV	Luke	22	19	Then Jesus took bread . He gave thanks and broke it . He handed it to them and said , “ This is my body . It is given for you . Every time you eat it , do this in memory of me. ”
NIRV	Luke	22	20	In the same way , after the supper he took the cup . He said , “ This cup is the new covenant in my blood . It is poured out for you .
NIRV	Luke	22	21	But someone here is going to hand me over to my enemies . His hand is with mine on the table .
NIRV	Luke	22	23	The apostles began to ask one another about this . They wondered which one of them would do it .
NIRV	Luke	22	24	They also started to argue . They disagreed about which of them was thought to be the most important person .
NIRV	Luke	22	25	Jesus said to them , “ The kings of the Gentiles hold power over their people . And those who order them around call themselves Protectors .
NIRV	Luke	22	26	But you must not be like that . Instead , the most important among you should be like the youngest . The one who rules should be like the one who serves .
NIRV	Luke	22	27	Who is more important ? Is it the one at the table , or the one who serves ? Isn ’ t it the one who is at the table ? But I am among you as one who serves .
NIRV	Luke	22	28	You have stood by me during my troubles .
NIRV	Luke	22	29	And I give you a kingdom , just as my Father gave me a kingdom .
NIRV	Luke	22	30	Then you will eat and drink at my table in my kingdom . And you will sit on thrones , judging the
NIRV	Luke	22	31	“ Simon , Simon ! Satan has asked to sift all of you disciples like wheat .
NIRV	Luke	22	32	But I have prayed for you , Simon . I have prayed that your faith will not fail . When you have turned back , help your brothers to be strong. ”
NIRV	Luke	22	33	But Simon replied , “ Lord , I am ready to go with you to prison and to death. ”
NIRV	Luke	22	34	Jesus answered , “ I tell you , Peter , you will say three times that you don ’ t know me . And you will do it before the rooster crows today. ”
NIRV	Luke	22	35	Then Jesus asked the disciples , “ Did you need anything when I sent you without a purse , bag or sandals ? ” “ Nothing , ” they answered .
NIRV	Luke	22	36	He said to them , “ But now if you have a purse , take it . And also take a bag . If you don ’ t have a sword , sell your coat and buy one .
NIRV	Luke	22	37	It is written , ‘ He was counted among those who had committed crimes. ’ ( Isaiah 53:12 ) I tell you that what is written about me must come true . Yes , it is already coming true. ”
NIRV	Luke	22	38	The disciples said , “ See , Lord , here are two swords. ” “ Two swords are enough ! ” he replied . Jesus Prays on the Mount of Olives
NIRV	Luke	22	39	Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives . His disciples followed him .
NIRV	Luke	22	40	When they reached the place , Jesus spoke . “ Pray that you won ’ t fall into sin when you are tempted , ” he said to them .
NIRV	Luke	22	41	Then he went a short distance away from them . There he got down on his knees and prayed .
NIRV	Luke	22	42	He said , “ Father , if you are willing , take this cup of suffering away from me . But do what you want , not what I want. ”
NIRV	Luke	22	43	An angel from heaven appeared to Jesus and gave him strength .
NIRV	Luke	22	44	Because he was very sad and troubled , he prayed even harder . His sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground .
NIRV	Luke	22	45	After that , he got up from prayer and went back to the disciples . He found them sleeping . They were worn out because they were very sad .
NIRV	Luke	22	46	“ Why are you sleeping ? ” he asked them . “ Get up ! Pray that you won ’ t fall into sin when you are tempted. ” Jesus Is Arrested
NIRV	Luke	22	47	While Jesus was still speaking , a crowd came up . The man named Judas was leading them . He was one of the
NIRV	Luke	22	48	But Jesus asked him , “ Judas , are you handing over the Son of Man with a kiss ? ”
NIRV	Luke	22	49	Jesus ’ followers saw what was going to happen . So they said , “ Lord , should we use our swords against them ? ”
NIRV	Luke	22	50	One of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear .
NIRV	Luke	22	51	But Jesus answered , “ Stop this ! ” And he touched the man ’ s ear and healed him .
NIRV	Luke	22	52	Then Jesus spoke to the chief priests , the officers of the temple guard , and the elders . They had all come for him . “ Am I leading a band of armed men against you ? ” he asked . “ Do you have to come with swords and clubs ?
NIRV	Luke	22	53	Every day I was with you in the temple courtyard . And you didn ’ t lay a hand on me . But this is your hour . This is when darkness rules. ” Peter Says He Does Not Know Jesus
NIRV	Luke	22	54	Then the men arrested Jesus and led him away . They took him into the high priest ’ s house . Peter followed from far away .
NIRV	Luke	22	55	Some people there started a fire in the middle of the courtyard . Then they sat down together . Peter sat down with them .
NIRV	Luke	22	56	A female servant saw him sitting there in the firelight . She looked closely at him . Then she said , “ This man was with Jesus. ”
NIRV	Luke	22	57	But Peter said he had not been with him . “ Woman , I don ’ t know him , ” he said .
NIRV	Luke	22	58	A little later someone else saw Peter . “ You also are one of them , ” he said . “ No , ” Peter replied . “ I ’ m not ! ”
NIRV	Luke	22	59	About an hour later , another person spoke up . “ This fellow must have been with Jesus , ” he said . “ He is from Galilee. ”
NIRV	Luke	22	60	Peter replied , “ Man , I don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about ! ” Just as he was speaking , the rooster crowed .
NIRV	Luke	22	61	The Lord turned and looked right at Peter . Then Peter remembered what the Lord had spoken to him . “ The rooster will crow today , ” Jesus had said . “ Before it does , you will say three times that you don ’ t know me. ”
NIRV	Luke	22	62	Peter went outside . He broke down and cried . The Guards Make Fun of Jesus
NIRV	Luke	22	63	There were men guarding Jesus . They began laughing at him and beating him .
NIRV	Luke	22	64	They blindfolded him . They said , “ Prophesy ! Who hit you ? ”
NIRV	Luke	22	65	They also said many other things to make fun of him . Jesus Is Brought to Pilate and Herod
NIRV	Luke	22	66	At dawn the elders of the people met together . These included the chief priests and the teachers of the law . Jesus was led to them .
NIRV	Luke	22	67	“ If you are the Messiah , ” they said , “ tell us. ” Jesus answered , “ If I tell you , you will not believe me .
NIRV	Luke	22	68	And if I asked you , you would not answer .
NIRV	Luke	22	69	But from now on , the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God. ”
NIRV	Luke	22	70	They all asked , “ Are you the Son of God then ? ” He replied , “ You say that I am. ”
NIRV	Luke	22	71	Then they said , “ Why do we need any more witnesses ? We have heard it from his own lips. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Luke	23	23	But with loud shouts they kept calling for Jesus to be crucified . The people ’ s shouts won out .
NIRV	Luke	23	2	They began to bring charges against Jesus . They said , “ We have found this man misleading our people . He is against paying taxes to Caesar . And he claims to be Messiah , a king. ”
NIRV	Luke	23	3	So Pilate asked Jesus , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” “ You have said so , ” Jesus replied .
NIRV	Luke	23	4	Then Pilate spoke to the chief priests and the crowd . He announced , “ I find no basis for a charge against this man. ”
NIRV	Luke	23	5	But they kept it up . They said , “ His teaching stirs up the people all over Judea . He started in Galilee and has come all the way here. ”
NIRV	Luke	23	6	When Pilate heard this , he asked if the man was from Galilee .
NIRV	Luke	23	7	He learned that Jesus was from Herod ’ s area of authority . So Pilate sent Jesus to Herod . At that time Herod was also in Jerusalem .
NIRV	Luke	23	8	When Herod saw Jesus , he was very pleased . He had been wanting to see Jesus for a long time . He had heard much about him . He hoped to see Jesus perform a sign of some kind .
NIRV	Luke	23	9	Herod asked him many questions , but Jesus gave him no answer .
NIRV	Luke	23	10	The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there . With loud shouts they brought charges against him .
NIRV	Luke	23	11	Herod and his soldiers laughed at him and made fun of him . They dressed him in a beautiful robe . Then they sent him back to Pilate .
NIRV	Luke	23	12	That day Herod and Pilate became friends . Before this time they had been enemies .
NIRV	Luke	23	13	Pilate called together the chief priests , the rulers and the people .
NIRV	Luke	23	14	He said to them , “ You brought me this man . You said he was turning the people against the authorities . I have questioned him in front of you . I have found no basis for your charges against him .
NIRV	Luke	23	15	Herod hasn ’ t either . So he sent Jesus back to us . As you can see , Jesus has done nothing that is worthy of death . 16-17 So I will just have him whipped and let him go. ”
NIRV	Luke	23	18	But the whole crowd shouted , “ Kill this man ! But let Barabbas go ! ”
NIRV	Luke	23	19	Barabbas had been thrown into prison . He had taken part in a struggle in the city against the authorities . He had also committed murder .
NIRV	Luke	23	20	Pilate wanted to let Jesus go . So he made an appeal to the crowd again .
NIRV	Luke	23	21	But they kept shouting , “ Crucify him ! Crucify him ! ”
NIRV	Luke	23	22	Pilate spoke to them for the third time . “ Why ? ” he asked . “ What wrong has this man done ? I have found no reason to have him put to death . So I will just have him whipped and let him go. ”
NIRV	Luke	23	24	So Pilate decided to give them what they wanted .
NIRV	Luke	23	25	He set free the man they asked for . The man had been thrown in prison for murder and for fighting against the authorities . Pilate handed Jesus over to them so they could carry out their plans . Jesus Is Nailed to a Cross
NIRV	Luke	23	26	As the soldiers led Jesus away , they took hold of Simon . Simon was from Cyrene . He was on his way in from the country . They put a wooden cross on his shoulders . Then they made him carry it behind Jesus .
NIRV	Luke	23	27	A large number of people followed Jesus . Some were women whose hearts were filled with sorrow . They cried loudly because of him .
NIRV	Luke	23	28	Jesus turned and said to them , “ Daughters of Jerusalem , do not weep for me . Weep for yourselves and for your children .
NIRV	Luke	23	29	The time will come when you will say , ‘ Blessed are the women who can ’ t have children ! Blessed are those who never gave birth or nursed babies ! ’
NIRV	Luke	23	30	It is written , “ ‘ The people will say to the mountains , “ Fall on us ! ” They ’ ll say to the hills , “ Cover us ! ” ’ ( Hosea 10:8 )
NIRV	Luke	23	31	People do these things when trees are green . So what will happen when trees are dry ? ”
NIRV	Luke	23	32	Two other men were also led out with Jesus to be killed . Both of them had broken the law .
NIRV	Luke	23	33	The soldiers brought them to the place called the Skull . There they nailed Jesus to the cross . He hung between the two criminals . One was on his right and one was on his left .
NIRV	Luke	23	34	Jesus said , “ Father , forgive them . They don ’ t know what they are doing. ” The soldiers divided up his clothes by casting lots .
NIRV	Luke	23	35	The people stood there watching . The rulers even made fun of Jesus . They said , “ He saved others . Let him save himself if he is God ’ s Messiah , the Chosen One. ”
NIRV	Luke	23	36	The soldiers also came up and poked fun at him . They offered him wine vinegar .
NIRV	Luke	23	37	They said , “ If you are the king of the Jews , save yourself. ”
NIRV	Luke	23	38	A written sign had been placed above him . It read , this is the king of the jews .
NIRV	Luke	23	39	One of the criminals hanging there made fun of Jesus . He said , “ Aren ’ t you the Messiah ? Save yourself ! Save us ! ”
NIRV	Luke	23	40	But the other criminal scolded him . “ Don ’ t you have any respect for God ? ” he said . “ Remember , you are under the same sentence of death .
NIRV	Luke	23	41	We are being punished fairly . We are getting just what our actions call for . But this man hasn ’ t done anything wrong. ”
NIRV	Luke	23	42	Then he said , “ Jesus , remember me when you come into your kingdom. ”
NIRV	Luke	23	43	Jesus answered him , “ What I ’ m about to tell you is true . Today you will be with me in paradise. ” Jesus Dies
NIRV	Luke	23	44	It was now about noon . Then darkness covered the whole land until three o ’ clock .
NIRV	Luke	23	45	The sun had stopped shining . The temple curtain was torn in two .
NIRV	Luke	23	46	Jesus called out in a loud voice , “ Father , into your hands I commit my life. ” After he said this , he took his last breath .
NIRV	Luke	23	47	The Roman commander saw what had happened . He praised God and said , “ Jesus was surely a man who did what was right. ”
NIRV	Luke	23	48	The people had gathered to watch this sight . When they saw what happened , they felt very sad . Then they went away .
NIRV	Luke	23	49	But all those who knew Jesus stood not very far away , watching these things . They included the women who had followed him from Galilee . Jesus Is Buried
NIRV	Luke	23	50	A man named Joseph was a member of the Jewish Council . He was a good and honest man .
NIRV	Luke	23	51	Joseph had not agreed with what the leaders had decided and done . He was from Arimathea , a town in Judea . He himself was waiting for God ’ s kingdom .
NIRV	Luke	23	52	Joseph went to Pilate and asked for Jesus ’ body .
NIRV	Luke	23	53	Joseph took it down and wrapped it in linen cloth . Then he placed it in a tomb cut in the rock . No one had ever been buried there .
NIRV	Luke	23	54	It was Preparation Day . The Sabbath day was about to begin .
NIRV	Luke	23	55	The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph . They saw the tomb and how Jesus ’ body was placed in it .
NIRV	Luke	23	56	Then they went home . There they prepared spices and perfumes . But they rested on the Sabbath day in order to obey the Law . Copyright ©

NIRV	Luke	24	2	They found the stone rolled away from it .
NIRV	Luke	24	3	When they entered the tomb , they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
NIRV	Luke	24	4	They were wondering about this . Suddenly two men in clothes as bright as lightning stood beside them .
NIRV	Luke	24	5	The women were terrified . They bowed down with their faces to the ground . Then the men said to them , “ Why do you look for the living among the dead ?
NIRV	Luke	24	6	Jesus is not here ! He has risen ! Remember how he told you he would rise . It was while he was still with you in Galilee .
NIRV	Luke	24	7	He said , ‘ The Son of Man must be handed over to sinful people . He must be nailed to a cross . On the third day he will rise from the dead. ’ ”
NIRV	Luke	24	8	Then the women remembered Jesus ’ words .
NIRV	Luke	24	9	They came back from the tomb . They told all these things to the
NIRV	Luke	24	11	disciples and those with them . They were all gathered together .
NIRV	Luke	24	10	Mary Magdalene , Joanna , Mary the mother of James , and the others with them were the ones who told the apostles .

NIRV	Luke	24	13	That same day two of Jesus ’ followers were going to a village called Emmaus . It was about seven miles from Jerusalem .
NIRV	Luke	24	14	They were talking with each other about everything that had happened .
NIRV	Luke	24	15	As they talked about those things , Jesus himself came up and walked along with them .
NIRV	Luke	24	16	But God kept them from recognizing him .
NIRV	Luke	24	17	Jesus asked them , “ What are you talking about as you walk along ? ” They stood still , and their faces were sad .
NIRV	Luke	24	18	One of them was named Cleopas . He said to Jesus , “ Are you the only person visiting Jerusalem who doesn ’ t know ? Don ’ t you know about the things that have happened there in the last few days ? ”
NIRV	Luke	24	19	“ What things ? ” Jesus asked . “ About Jesus of Nazareth , ” they replied . “ He was a prophet . He was powerful in what he said and did in the sight of God and all the people .
NIRV	Luke	24	20	The chief priests and our rulers handed Jesus over to be sentenced to death . They nailed him to a cross .
NIRV	Luke	24	21	But we had hoped that he was the one who was going to set Israel free . Also , it is the third day since all this happened .
NIRV	Luke	24	22	Some of our women amazed us too . Early this morning they went to the tomb .
NIRV	Luke	24	23	But they didn ’ t find his body . So they came and told us what they had seen . They saw angels , who said Jesus was alive .
NIRV	Luke	24	25	Jesus said to them , “ How foolish you are ! How long it takes you to believe all that the prophets said !
NIRV	Luke	24	26	Didn ’ t the Messiah have to suffer these things and then receive his glory ? ”
NIRV	Luke	24	27	Jesus explained to them what was said about himself in all the Scriptures . He began with Moses and all the Prophets .
NIRV	Luke	24	28	They approached the village where they were going . Jesus kept walking as if he were going farther .
NIRV	Luke	24	29	But they tried hard to keep him from leaving . They said , “ Stay with us . It is nearly evening . The day is almost over. ” So he went in to stay with them .
NIRV	Luke	24	30	He joined them at the table . Then he took bread and gave thanks . He broke it and began to give it to them .
NIRV	Luke	24	31	Their eyes were opened , and they recognized him . But then he disappeared from their sight .
NIRV	Luke	24	32	They said to each other , “ He explained to us what the Scriptures meant . Weren ’ t we excited as he talked with us on the road ? ”
NIRV	Luke	24	33	They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem . There they found the
NIRV	Luke	24	34	They were saying , “ It ’ s true ! The Lord has risen ! He has appeared to Simon ! ”
NIRV	Luke	24	35	Then the two of them told what had happened to them on the way . They told how they had recognized Jesus when he broke the bread . Jesus Appears to the Disciples
NIRV	Luke	24	36	The disciples were still talking about this when Jesus himself suddenly stood among them . He said , “ May you have peace ! ”
NIRV	Luke	24	37	They were surprised and terrified . They thought they were seeing a ghost .
NIRV	Luke	24	38	Jesus said to them , “ Why are you troubled ? Why do you have doubts in your minds ?
NIRV	Luke	24	39	Look at my hands and my feet . It ’ s really me ! Touch me and see . A ghost does not have a body or bones . But you can see that I do. ”
NIRV	Luke	24	40	After he said that , he showed them his hands and feet .
NIRV	Luke	24	41	But they still did not believe it . They were amazed and filled with joy . So Jesus asked them , “ Do you have anything here to eat ? ”
NIRV	Luke	24	42	They gave him a piece of cooked fish .
NIRV	Luke	24	43	He took it and ate it in front of them .
NIRV	Luke	24	44	Jesus said to them , “ This is what I told you while I was still with you . Everything written about me in the Law of Moses , the Prophets and the Psalms must come true. ”
NIRV	Luke	24	45	Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures .
NIRV	Luke	24	46	He told them , “ This is what is written . The Messiah will suffer . He will rise from the dead on the third day .
NIRV	Luke	24	47	His followers will preach in his name . They will tell others to turn away from their sins and be forgiven . People from every nation will hear it , beginning at Jerusalem .
NIRV	Luke	24	48	You have seen these things with your own eyes .
NIRV	Luke	24	49	I am going to send you what my Father has promised . But for now , stay in the city . Stay there until you have received power from heaven. ” Jesus Is Taken Up Into Heaven
NIRV	Luke	24	50	Jesus led his disciples out to the area near Bethany . Then he lifted up his hands and blessed them .
NIRV	Luke	24	51	While he was blessing them , he left them . He was taken up into heaven .
NIRV	Luke	24	52	Then they worshiped him . With great joy , they returned to Jerusalem .
NIRV	Luke	24	53	Every day they went to the temple , praising God . Copyright ©

NIRV	John	1	1	In the beginning , the Word was already there . The Word was with God , and the Word was God .
NIRV	John	1	2	He was with God in the beginning .
NIRV	John	1	3	All things were made through him . Nothing that has been made was made without him .
NIRV	John	1	4	Life was in him , and that life was the light for all people .
NIRV	John	1	5	The light shines in the darkness . But the darkness has not overcome the light .
NIRV	John	1	6	There was a man sent from God . His name was John .
NIRV	John	1	7	He came to be a witness about that light . He was a witness so that all people might believe .
NIRV	John	1	8	John himself was not the light . He came only as a witness to the light .
NIRV	John	1	9	The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world .
NIRV	John	1	10	The Word was in the world . And the world was made through him . But the world did not recognize him .
NIRV	John	1	11	He came to what was his own . But his own people did not accept him .
NIRV	John	1	12	Some people did accept him and did believe in his name . He gave them the right to become children of God .
NIRV	John	1	13	To be a child of God has nothing to do with human parents . Children of God are not born because of human choice or because a husband wants them to be born . They are born because of what God does .
NIRV	John	1	14	The Word became a human being . He made his home with us . We have seen his glory . It is the glory of the One and Only , who came from the Father . And the Word was full of grace and truth .
NIRV	John	1	15	John was a witness about the Word . John cried out and said , “ This was the one I was talking about . I said , ‘ He who comes after me is more important than I am . He is more important because he existed before I was born. ’ ”
NIRV	John	1	16	God is full of grace . From him we have all received grace in place of the grace already given .
NIRV	John	1	17	In the past , God gave us grace through the law of Moses . Now , grace and truth come to us through Jesus Christ .
NIRV	John	1	18	No one has ever seen God . But the One and Only is God and is at the Father ’ s side . The one at the Father ’ s side has shown us what God is like . John the Baptist Says That He Is Not the Messiah
NIRV	John	1	19	The Jewish leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask John who he was . John spoke the truth to them .
NIRV	John	1	20	He did not try to hide the truth . He spoke to them openly . He said , “ I am not the Messiah. ”
NIRV	John	1	21	They asked him , “ Then who are you ? Are you Elijah ? ” He said , “ I am not. ” “ Are you the Prophet we ’ ve been expecting ? ” they asked . “ No , ” he answered .
NIRV	John	1	22	They asked one last time , “ Who are you ? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? ”
NIRV	John	1	23	John replied , using the words of Isaiah the prophet . John said , “ I ’ m the messenger who is calling out in the desert , ‘ Make the way for the Lord straight. ’ ” ( Isaiah 40:3 )
NIRV	John	1	24	The Pharisees who had been sent
NIRV	John	1	25	asked him , “ If you are not the Messiah , why are you baptizing people ? Why are you doing that if you aren ’ t Elijah or the Prophet we ’ ve been expecting ? ”
NIRV	John	1	26	“ I baptize people with water , ” John replied . “ But someone is standing among you whom you do not know .
NIRV	John	1	27	He is the one who comes after me . I am not good enough to untie his sandals. ”
NIRV	John	1	28	This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan River . That was where John was baptizing . What John Says About Jesus
NIRV	John	1	29	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him . John said , “ Look ! The Lamb of God ! He takes away the sin of the world !
NIRV	John	1	30	This is the one I was talking about . I said , ‘ A man who comes after me is more important than I am . That ’ s because he existed before I was born. ’
NIRV	John	1	31	I did not know him . But God wants to make it clear to Israel who this person is . That ’ s the reason I came baptizing with water. ”
NIRV	John	1	32	Then John told them , “ I saw the Holy Spirit come down from heaven like a dove . The Spirit remained on Jesus .
NIRV	John	1	33	I myself did not know him . But the one who sent me to baptize with water told me , ‘ You will see the Spirit come down and remain on someone . He is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit. ’
NIRV	John	1	34	I have seen it happen . I am a witness that this is God ’ s Chosen One. ” John ’ s Disciples Follow Jesus
NIRV	John	1	35	The next day John was there again with two of his disciples .
NIRV	John	1	36	He saw Jesus walking by . John said , “ Look ! The Lamb of God ! ”
NIRV	John	1	37	The two disciples heard him say this . So they followed Jesus .
NIRV	John	1	38	Then Jesus turned around and saw them following . He asked , “ What do you want ? ” They said , “ Rabbi , where are you staying ? ” Rabbi means Teacher .
NIRV	John	1	39	“ Come , ” he replied . “ You will see. ” So they went and saw where he was staying . They spent the rest of the day with him . It was about four o ’ clock in the afternoon .
NIRV	John	1	40	Andrew was Simon Peter ’ s brother . Andrew was one of the two disciples who heard what John had said . He had also followed Jesus .
NIRV	John	1	41	The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon . He told him , “ We have found the Messiah. ” Messiah means Christ .
NIRV	John	1	42	And he brought Simon to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , “ You are Simon , son of John . You will be called Cephas. ” Cephas means Peter , or Rock . Jesus Chooses Philip and Nathanael
NIRV	John	1	43	The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee . He found Philip and said to him , “ Follow me. ”
NIRV	John	1	44	Philip was from the town of Bethsaida . So were Andrew and Peter .
NIRV	John	1	45	Philip found Nathanael and told him , “ We have found the one whom Moses wrote about in the Law . The prophets also wrote about him . He is Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph. ”
NIRV	John	1	46	“ Nazareth ! Can anything good come from there ? ” Nathanael asked . “ Come and see , ” said Philip .
NIRV	John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael approaching . Here is what Jesus said about him . “ He is a true Israelite . Nothing about him is false. ”
NIRV	John	1	48	“ How do you know me ? ” Nathanael asked . Jesus answered , “ I saw you while you were still under the fig tree . I saw you there before Philip called you. ”
NIRV	John	1	49	Nathanael replied , “ Rabbi , you are the Son of God . You are the king of Israel. ”
NIRV	John	1	50	Jesus said , “ You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree . You will see greater things than that. ”
NIRV	John	1	51	Then he said to the disciples , “ What I ’ m about to tell you is true . You will see heaven open . You will see the angels of God going up and coming down on the Son of Man. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	John	2	2	Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding .
NIRV	John	2	3	When the wine was gone , Jesus ’ mother said to him , “ They have no more wine. ”
NIRV	John	2	4	“ Dear woman , why are you telling me about this ? ” Jesus replied . “ The time for me to show who I really am isn ’ t here yet. ”
NIRV	John	2	5	His mother said to the servants , “ Do what he tells you. ”
NIRV	John	2	6	Six stone water jars stood nearby . The Jews used water from that kind of jar for special washings . They did that to make themselves pure and “ clean. ” Each jar could hold
NIRV	John	2	20	They replied , “ It has taken
NIRV	John	2	30	gallons .
NIRV	John	2	7	Jesus said to the servants , “ Fill the jars with water. ” So they filled them to the top .
NIRV	John	2	8	Then he told them , “ Now dip some out . Take it to the person in charge of the dinner. ” They did what he said .
NIRV	John	2	9	The person in charge tasted the water that had been turned into wine . He didn ’ t realize where it had come from . But the servants who had brought the water knew . Then the person in charge called the groom to one side .
NIRV	John	2	10	He said to him , “ Everyone brings out the best wine first . They bring out the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink . But you have saved the best until now. ”
NIRV	John	2	11	What Jesus did here in Cana in Galilee was the first of his signs . Jesus showed his glory by doing this sign . And his disciples believed in him .
NIRV	John	2	12	After this , Jesus went down to Capernaum . His mother and brothers and disciples went with him . They all stayed there for a few days . Jesus Clears Out the Temple Courtyard
NIRV	John	2	13	It was almost time for the Jewish Passover Feast . So Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
NIRV	John	2	14	In the temple courtyard he found people selling cattle , sheep and doves . Others were sitting at tables exchanging money .
NIRV	John	2	15	So Jesus made a whip out of ropes . He chased all the sheep and cattle from the temple courtyard . He scattered the coins of the people exchanging money . And he turned over their tables .
NIRV	John	2	16	He told those who were selling doves , “ Get these out of here ! Stop turning my Father ’ s house into a market ! ”
NIRV	John	2	17	His disciples remembered what had been written . It says , “ My great love for your house will destroy me. ” ( Psalm 69:9 )
NIRV	John	2	18	Then the Jewish leaders asked him , “ What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do this ? ”
NIRV	John	2	19	Jesus answered them , “ When you destroy this temple , I will raise it up again in three days. ”
NIRV	John	2	46	years to build this temple . Are you going to raise it up in three days ? ”
NIRV	John	2	21	But the temple Jesus had spoken about was his body .
NIRV	John	2	22	His disciples later remembered what he had said . That was after he had been raised from the dead . Then they believed the Scripture . They also believed the words that Jesus had spoken .
NIRV	John	2	23	Meanwhile , he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast . Many people saw the signs he was doing . And they believed in his name .
NIRV	John	2	24	But Jesus did not fully trust them . He knew what people are like .
NIRV	John	2	25	He didn ’ t need anyone to tell him what people are like . He already knew why people do what they do . Copyright ©

NIRV	John	3	3	Jesus replied , “ What I ’ m about to tell you is true . No one can see God ’ s kingdom unless they are born again. ”
NIRV	John	3	2	He came to Jesus at night and said , “ Rabbi , we know that you are a teacher who has come from God . We know that God is with you . If he weren ’ t , you couldn ’ t do the signs you are doing. ”
NIRV	John	3	4	“ How can someone be born when they are old ? ” Nicodemus asked . “ They can ’ t go back inside their mother ! They can ’ t be born a second time ! ”
NIRV	John	3	5	Jesus answered , “ What I ’ m about to tell you is true . No one can enter God ’ s kingdom unless they are born with water and the Holy Spirit .
NIRV	John	3	6	People give birth to people . But the Spirit gives birth to spirit .
NIRV	John	3	7	You should not be surprised when I say , ‘ You must all be born again. ’
NIRV	John	3	8	The wind blows where it wants to . You hear the sound it makes . But you can ’ t tell where it comes from or where it is going . It is the same with everyone who is born with the Spirit. ”
NIRV	John	3	9	“ How can this be ? ” Nicodemus asked .
NIRV	John	3	10	“ You are Israel ’ s teacher , ” said Jesus . “ Don ’ t you understand these things ?
NIRV	John	3	11	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . We speak about what we know . We are witnesses about what we have seen . But still you people do not accept what we say .
NIRV	John	3	12	I have spoken to you about earthly things , and you do not believe . So how will you believe if I speak about heavenly things ?
NIRV	John	3	13	No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven . He is the Son of Man .
NIRV	John	3	14	Moses lifted up the snake in the desert . In the same way , the Son of Man must also be lifted up .
NIRV	John	3	15	Then everyone who believes may have eternal life in him. ”
NIRV	John	3	16	God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son . Anyone who believes in him will not die but will have eternal life .
NIRV	John	3	17	God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world . He sent his Son to save the world through him .
NIRV	John	3	18	Anyone who believes in him is not judged . But anyone who does not believe is judged already . They have not believed in the name of God ’ s one and only Son .
NIRV	John	3	19	Here is the judgment . Light has come into the world , but people loved darkness instead of light . They loved darkness because what they did was evil .
NIRV	John	3	20	Everyone who does evil deeds hates the light . They will not come into the light . They are afraid that what they do will be seen .
NIRV	John	3	21	But anyone who lives by the truth comes into the light . They live by the truth with God ’ s help . They come into the light so that it will be easy to see their good deeds . John the Baptist Is a Witness About Jesus
NIRV	John	3	22	After this , Jesus and his disciples went out into the countryside of Judea . There he spent some time with them . And he baptized people there .
NIRV	John	3	23	John was also baptizing . He was at Aenon near Salim , where there was plenty of water . People were coming and being baptized .
NIRV	John	3	24	This was before John was put in prison .
NIRV	John	3	25	Some of John ’ s disciples and a certain Jew began to argue . They argued about special washings to make people “ clean. ”
NIRV	John	3	26	They came to John and here is what they said to him . “ Rabbi , that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River is baptizing people . He is the one you told us about . Everyone is going to him. ”
NIRV	John	3	27	John replied , “ A person can receive only what God gives them from heaven .
NIRV	John	3	28	You yourselves are witnesses that I said , ‘ I am not the Messiah . I was sent ahead of him. ’
NIRV	John	3	29	The bride belongs to the groom . The friend who helps the groom waits and listens for him . He is full of joy when he hears the groom ’ s voice . That joy is mine , and it is now complete .
NIRV	John	3	30	He must become more important . I must become less important .
NIRV	John	3	31	“ The one who comes from above is above everything . The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks like someone from the earth . The one who comes from heaven is above everything .
NIRV	John	3	32	He is a witness to what he has seen and heard . But no one accepts what he says .
NIRV	John	3	33	Anyone who has accepted it has said , ‘ Yes . God is truthful. ’
NIRV	John	3	34	The one whom God has sent speaks God ’ s words . That ’ s because God gives the Holy Spirit without limit .
NIRV	John	3	35	The Father loves the Son and has put everything into his hands .
NIRV	John	3	36	Anyone who believes in the Son has eternal life . Anyone who does not believe in the Son will not have life . God ’ s anger remains on them. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	John	4	4	Jesus had to go through Samaria .
NIRV	John	4	2	But in fact Jesus was not baptizing . His disciples were .
NIRV	John	4	3	So Jesus left Judea and went back again to Galilee .
NIRV	John	4	5	He came to a town in Samaria called Sychar . It was near the piece of land Jacob had given his son Joseph .
NIRV	John	4	6	Jacob ’ s well was there . Jesus was tired from the journey . So he sat down by the well . It was about noon .
NIRV	John	4	7	A woman from Samaria came to get some water . Jesus said to her , “ Will you give me a drink ? ”
NIRV	John	4	8	His disciples had gone into the town to buy food .
NIRV	John	4	9	The Samaritan woman said to him , “ You are a Jew . I am a Samaritan woman . How can you ask me for a drink ? ” She said this because Jews don ’ t have anything to do with Samaritans .
NIRV	John	4	10	Jesus answered her , “ You do not know what God ’ s gift is . And you do not know who is asking you for a drink . If you did , you would have asked him . He would have given you living water. ”
NIRV	John	4	11	“ Sir , ” the woman said , “ you don ’ t have anything to get water with . The well is deep . Where can you get this living water ?
NIRV	John	4	12	Our father Jacob gave us the well . He drank from it himself . So did his sons and his livestock . Are you more important than he is ? ”
NIRV	John	4	13	Jesus answered , “ Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again .
NIRV	John	4	14	But anyone who drinks the water I give them will never be thirsty . In fact , the water I give them will become a spring of water in them . It will flow up into eternal life. ”
NIRV	John	4	15	The woman said to him , “ Sir , give me this water . Then I will never be thirsty . And I won ’ t have to keep coming here to get water. ”
NIRV	John	4	16	He told her , “ Go . Get your husband and come back. ”
NIRV	John	4	17	“ I have no husband , ” she replied . Jesus said to her , “ You are right when you say you have no husband .
NIRV	John	4	18	The fact is , you have had five husbands . And the man you live with now is not your husband . What you have just said is very true. ”
NIRV	John	4	19	“ Sir , ” the woman said , “ I can see that you are a prophet .
NIRV	John	4	20	Our people have always worshiped on this mountain . But you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem. ”
NIRV	John	4	21	Jesus said , “ Woman , believe me . A time is coming when you will not worship the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem .
NIRV	John	4	22	You Samaritans worship what you do not know . We worship what we do know . Salvation comes from the Jews .
NIRV	John	4	23	But a new time is coming . In fact , it is already here . True worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth . They are the kind of worshipers the Father is looking for .
NIRV	John	4	24	God is spirit . His worshipers must worship him in the Spirit and in truth. ”
NIRV	John	4	25	The woman said , “ I know that Messiah is coming. ” Messiah means Christ . “ When he comes , he will explain everything to us. ”
NIRV	John	4	26	Then Jesus said , “ The one you ’ re talking about is the one speaking to you . I am he. ” The Disciples Join Jesus Again
NIRV	John	4	27	Just then Jesus ’ disciples returned . They were surprised to find him talking with a woman . But no one asked , “ What do you want from her ? ” No one asked , “ Why are you talking with her ? ”
NIRV	John	4	28	The woman left her water jar and went back to the town . She said to the people ,
NIRV	John	4	29	“ Come . See a man who told me everything I ’ ve ever done . Could this be the Messiah ? ”
NIRV	John	4	30	The people came out of the town and made their way toward Jesus .
NIRV	John	4	31	His disciples were saying to him , “ Rabbi , eat something ! ”
NIRV	John	4	32	But he said to them , “ I have food to eat that you know nothing about. ”
NIRV	John	4	33	Then his disciples asked each other , “ Did someone bring him food ? ”
NIRV	John	4	34	Jesus said , “ My food is to do what my Father sent me to do . My food is to finish his work .
NIRV	John	4	35	Don ’ t you have a saying ? You say , ‘ It ’ s still four months until harvest time. ’ But I tell you , open your eyes ! Look at the fields ! They are ripe for harvest right now .
NIRV	John	4	36	Even now the one who gathers the crop is getting paid . They are already harvesting the crop for eternal life . So the one who plants and the one who gathers can now be glad together .
NIRV	John	4	37	Here is a true saying . ‘ One plants and another gathers. ’
NIRV	John	4	38	I sent you to gather what you have not worked for . Others have done the hard work . You have gathered the benefits of their work. ” Many Samaritans Believe in Jesus
NIRV	John	4	39	Many of the Samaritans from the town of Sychar believed in Jesus . They believed because of what the woman had said about him . She said , “ He told me everything I ’ ve ever done. ”
NIRV	John	4	40	Then the Samaritans came to him and tried to get him to stay with them . So he stayed two days .
NIRV	John	4	41	Because of what he said , many more people became believers .
NIRV	John	4	42	They said to the woman , “ We no longer believe just because of what you said . We have now heard for ourselves . We know that this man really is the Savior of the world. ” Jesus Heals an Official ’ s Son
NIRV	John	4	43	After the two days , Jesus left for Galilee .
NIRV	John	4	44	He himself had pointed out that a prophet is not respected in his own country .
NIRV	John	4	45	When he arrived in Galilee , the people living there welcomed him . They had seen everything he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast . That was because they had also been there .
NIRV	John	4	46	Once more , Jesus visited Cana in Galilee . Cana is where he had turned the water into wine . A royal official was there . His son was sick in bed at Capernaum .
NIRV	John	4	47	The official heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea . So he went to Jesus and begged him to come and heal his son . The boy was close to death .
NIRV	John	4	48	Jesus told him , “ You people will never believe unless you see signs and wonders. ”
NIRV	John	4	49	The royal official said , “ Sir , come down before my child dies. ”
NIRV	John	4	50	“ Go , ” Jesus replied . “ Your son will live. ” The man believed what Jesus said , and so he left .
NIRV	John	4	51	While he was still on his way home , his slaves met him . They gave him the news that his boy was living .
NIRV	John	4	52	He asked what time his son got better . They said to him , “ Yesterday , at one o ’ clock in the afternoon , the fever left him. ”
NIRV	John	4	53	Then the father realized what had happened . That was the exact time Jesus had said to him , “ Your son will live. ” So he and his whole family became believers .

NIRV	John	5	5	One person was there who had not been able to walk for
NIRV	John	5	2	In Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate is a pool . In the Aramaic language it is called Bethesda . It is surrounded by five rows of columns with a roof over them . 3-4 Here a great number of disabled people used to lie down . Among them were those who were blind , those who could not walk , and those who could hardly move .
NIRV	John	5	38	And his word does not live in you . That ’ s because you do not believe the one he sent .
NIRV	John	5	6	Jesus saw him lying there . He knew that the man had been in that condition for a long time . So he asked him , “ Do you want to get well ? ”
NIRV	John	5	7	“ Sir , ” the disabled man replied , “ I have no one to help me into the pool when an angel stirs up the water . I try to get in , but someone else always goes down ahead of me. ”
NIRV	John	5	8	Then Jesus said to him , “ Get up ! Pick up your mat and walk. ”
NIRV	John	5	9	The man was healed right away . He picked up his mat and walked . This happened on a Sabbath day .
NIRV	John	5	10	So the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed , “ It is the Sabbath day . The law does not allow you to carry your mat. ”
NIRV	John	5	11	But he replied , “ The one who made me well said to me , ‘ Pick up your mat and walk. ’ ”
NIRV	John	5	12	They asked him , “ Who is this fellow ? Who told you to pick it up and walk ? ”
NIRV	John	5	13	The one who was healed had no idea who it was . Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there .
NIRV	John	5	14	Later Jesus found him at the temple . Jesus said to him , “ See , you are well again . Stop sinning , or something worse may happen to you. ”
NIRV	John	5	15	The man went away . He told the Jewish leaders it was Jesus who had made him well . The Authority of the Son
NIRV	John	5	16	Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath day . So the Jewish leaders began to oppose him .
NIRV	John	5	17	Jesus defended himself . He said to them , “ My Father is always doing his work . He is working right up to this day . I am working too. ”
NIRV	John	5	18	For this reason the Jewish leaders tried even harder to kill him . According to them , Jesus was not only breaking the law of the Sabbath day . He was even calling God his own Father . He was making himself equal with God .
NIRV	John	5	19	Jesus answered , “ What I ’ m about to tell you is true . The Son can do nothing by himself . He can do only what he sees his Father doing . What the Father does , the Son also does .
NIRV	John	5	20	This is because the Father loves the Son . The Father shows him everything he does . Yes , and the Father will show the Son even greater works than these . And you will be amazed .
NIRV	John	5	21	The Father raises the dead and gives them life . In the same way , the Son gives life to anyone he wants to .
NIRV	John	5	22	Also , the Father does not judge anyone . He has given the Son the task of judging .
NIRV	John	5	23	Then all people will honor the Son just as they honor the Father . Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father , who sent him .
NIRV	John	5	24	“ What I ’ m about to tell you is true . Anyone who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life . They will not be judged . They have crossed over from death to life .
NIRV	John	5	25	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . A time is coming for me to give life . In fact , it has already begun . The dead will hear the voice of the Son of God . Those who hear it will live .
NIRV	John	5	26	The Father has life in himself . He has allowed the Son also to have life in himself .
NIRV	John	5	27	And the Father has given him the authority to judge . This is because he is the Son of Man .
NIRV	John	5	28	“ Do not be amazed at this . A time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice .
NIRV	John	5	29	They will all come out of their graves . People who have done what is good will rise and live again . People who have done what is evil will rise and be found guilty .
NIRV	John	5	30	I can do nothing by myself . I judge only as I hear . And my judging is fair . I do not try to please myself . I try to please the one who sent me . Being a Witness About Jesus
NIRV	John	5	31	“ If I am a witness about myself , what I say is not true .
NIRV	John	5	32	There is someone else who is a witness in my favor . And I know that what he says about me is true .
NIRV	John	5	33	“ You have sent people to John the Baptist . He has been a witness to the truth .
NIRV	John	5	34	I do not accept what a person says . I only talk about what John says so that you can be saved .
NIRV	John	5	35	John was like a lamp that burned and gave light . For a while you chose to enjoy his light .
NIRV	John	5	36	“ What I say about myself is more important than what John says about me . I am doing the works the Father gave me to finish . These works are a witness that the Father has sent me .
NIRV	John	5	37	The Father who sent me is himself a witness about me . You have never heard his voice . You have never seen what he really looks like .
NIRV	John	5	39	You study the Scriptures carefully . You study them because you think they will give you eternal life . The Scriptures you study are a witness about me .
NIRV	John	5	40	But you refuse to come to me and receive life .
NIRV	John	5	41	“ I do not accept praise from human beings .
NIRV	John	5	42	But I know you . I know that you do not have love for God in your hearts .
NIRV	John	5	43	I have come in my Father ’ s name , and you do not accept me . But if someone else comes in his own name , you will accept him .
NIRV	John	5	44	You accept praise from one another . But you do not seek the praise that comes from the only God . So how can you believe ?
NIRV	John	5	45	“ Do not think I will bring charges against you in front of the Father . Moses is the one who does that . And he is the one you build your hopes on .
NIRV	John	5	46	Do you believe Moses ? Then you should believe me . He wrote about me .
NIRV	John	5	47	But you do not believe what he wrote . So how are you going to believe what I say ? ” Copyright ©

NIRV	John	6	6	He asked this only to test Philip . He already knew what he was going to do .
NIRV	John	6	2	A large crowd of people followed him . They had seen the signs he had done by healing sick people .
NIRV	John	6	3	Then Jesus went up on a mountainside . There he sat down with his disciples .
NIRV	John	6	4	The Jewish Passover Feast was near .
NIRV	John	6	5	Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him . So he said to Philip , “ Where can we buy bread for these people to eat ? ”
NIRV	John	6	7	Philip answered him , “ Suppose we were able to buy enough bread for each person to have just a bite . That would take more than half a year ’ s pay ! ”
NIRV	John	6	8	Another of his disciples spoke up . It was Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother . He said ,
NIRV	John	6	9	“ Here is a boy with five small loaves of barley bread . He also has two small fish . But how far will that go in such a large crowd ? ”
NIRV	John	6	10	Jesus said , “ Have the people sit down. ” There was plenty of grass in that place , and they sat down . About 5,000 men were there .
NIRV	John	6	11	Then Jesus took the loaves and gave thanks . He handed out the bread to those who were seated . He gave them as much as they wanted . And he did the same with the fish .
NIRV	John	6	12	disciples . But later he was going to hand Jesus over to his enemies . Copyright ©
NIRV	John	6	13	So they gathered what was left over from the five barley loaves . They filled
NIRV	John	6	14	The people saw the sign that Jesus did . Then they began to say , “ This must be the Prophet who is supposed to come into the world. ”
NIRV	John	6	15	But Jesus knew that they planned to come and force him to be their king . So he went away again to a mountain by himself . Jesus Walks on the Water
NIRV	John	6	16	When evening came , Jesus ’ disciples went down to the Sea of Galilee .
NIRV	John	6	17	There they got into a boat and headed across the lake toward Capernaum . By now it was dark . Jesus had not yet joined them .
NIRV	John	6	18	A strong wind was blowing , and the water became rough .
NIRV	John	6	19	They rowed about three or four miles . Then they saw Jesus coming toward the boat . He was walking on the water . They were frightened .
NIRV	John	6	20	But he said to them , “ It is I. Don ’ t be afraid. ”
NIRV	John	6	21	Then they agreed to take him into the boat . Right away the boat reached the shore where they were heading .
NIRV	John	6	22	The next day the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the lake realized something . They saw that only one boat had been there . They knew that Jesus had not gotten into it with his disciples . And they knew that the disciples had gone away alone .
NIRV	John	6	23	Then some boats arrived from Tiberias . It was near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord gave thanks .
NIRV	John	6	24	The crowd realized that Jesus and his disciples were not there . So they got into boats and went to Capernaum to look for Jesus . Jesus Is the Bread of Life
NIRV	John	6	25	They found him on the other side of the lake . They asked him , “ Rabbi , when did you get here ? ”
NIRV	John	6	26	Jesus answered , “ What I ’ m about to tell you is true . You are not looking for me because you saw the signs I did . You are looking for me because you ate the loaves until you were full .
NIRV	John	6	27	Do not work for food that spoils . Work for food that lasts forever . That is the food the Son of Man will give you . For God the Father has put his seal of approval on him. ”
NIRV	John	6	28	Then they asked him , “ What does God want from us ? What works does he want us to do ? ”
NIRV	John	6	29	Jesus answered , “ God ’ s work is to believe in the one he has sent. ”
NIRV	John	6	30	So they asked him , “ What sign will you give us ? What will you do so we can see it and believe you ?
NIRV	John	6	31	Long ago our people ate the manna in the desert . It is written in Scripture , ‘ The Lord gave them bread from heaven to eat. ’ ” ( Exodus 16:4 ; Nehemiah 9:15 ; Psalm 78:24,25 )
NIRV	John	6	32	Jesus said to them , “ What I ’ m about to tell you is true . It is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven . It is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven .
NIRV	John	6	33	The bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven . He gives life to the world. ”
NIRV	John	6	34	“ Sir , ” they said , “ always give us this bread. ”
NIRV	John	6	35	Then Jesus said , “ I am the bread of life . Whoever comes to me will never go hungry . And whoever believes in me will never be thirsty .
NIRV	John	6	36	But it is just as I told you . You have seen me , and you still do not believe .
NIRV	John	6	37	Everyone the Father gives me will come to me . I will never send away anyone who comes to me .
NIRV	John	6	38	I have not come down from heaven to do what I want to do . I have come to do what the one who sent me wants me to do .
NIRV	John	6	39	The one who sent me doesn ’ t want me to lose anyone he has given me . He wants me to raise them up on the last day .
NIRV	John	6	40	My Father wants all who look to the Son and believe in him to have eternal life . I will raise them up on the last day. ”
NIRV	John	6	41	Then the Jews there began to complain about Jesus . That was because he said , “ I am the bread that came down from heaven. ”
NIRV	John	6	42	They said , “ Isn ’ t this Jesus , the son of Joseph ? Don ’ t we know his father and mother ? How can he now say , ‘ I came down from heaven ’ ? ”
NIRV	John	6	43	“ Stop complaining among yourselves , ” Jesus answered .
NIRV	John	6	44	“ No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me brings them . Then I will raise them up on the last day .
NIRV	John	6	45	It is written in the Prophets , ‘ God will teach all of them. ’ ( Isaiah 54:13 ) Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me .
NIRV	John	6	46	No one has seen the Father except the one who has come from God . Only he has seen the Father .
NIRV	John	6	47	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . Everyone who believes has life forever .
NIRV	John	6	48	I am the bread of life .
NIRV	John	6	49	Long ago your people ate the manna in the desert , and they still died .
NIRV	John	6	50	But here is the bread that comes down from heaven . A person can eat it and not die .
NIRV	John	6	51	I am the living bread that came down from heaven . Everyone who eats some of this bread will live forever . This bread is my body . I will give it for the life of the world. ”
NIRV	John	6	52	Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves . They said , “ How can this man give us his body to eat ? ”
NIRV	John	6	53	Jesus said to them , “ What I ’ m about to tell you is true . You must eat the Son of Man ’ s body and drink his blood . If you don ’ t , you have no life in you .
NIRV	John	6	54	Anyone who eats my body and drinks my blood has eternal life . I will raise them up on the last day .
NIRV	John	6	55	My body is real food . My blood is real drink .
NIRV	John	6	56	Anyone who eats my body and drinks my blood remains in me . And I remain in them .
NIRV	John	6	57	The living Father sent me , and I live because of him . In the same way , those who feed on me will live because of me .
NIRV	John	6	58	This is the bread that came down from heaven . Long ago your people ate manna and died . But whoever eats this bread will live forever. ”
NIRV	John	6	59	He said this while he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum . Many Disciples Leave Jesus
NIRV	John	6	60	Jesus ’ disciples heard this . Many of them said , “ This is a hard teaching . Who can accept it ? ”
NIRV	John	6	61	Jesus was aware that his disciples were complaining about his teaching . So he said to them , “ Does this upset you ?
NIRV	John	6	62	Then what if you see the Son of Man go up to where he was before ?
NIRV	John	6	63	The Holy Spirit gives life . The body means nothing at all . The words I have spoken to you are full of the Spirit . They give life .
NIRV	John	6	64	But there are some of you who do not believe. ” Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe . And he had known who was going to hand him over to his enemies .
NIRV	John	6	65	So he continued speaking . He said , “ This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father helps them. ”
NIRV	John	6	66	From this time on , many of his disciples turned back . They no longer followed him .
NIRV	John	6	67	“ You don ’ t want to leave also , do you ? ” Jesus asked the
NIRV	John	6	68	Simon Peter answered him , “ Lord , who can we go to ? You have the words of eternal life .
NIRV	John	6	69	We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God. ”
NIRV	John	6	70	Then Jesus replied , “ Didn ’ t I choose you , the
NIRV	John	6	71	He meant Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot . Judas was one of the

NIRV	John	7	7	The people of the world can ’ t hate you . But they hate me . This is because I am a witness that their works are evil .
NIRV	John	7	2	The Jewish Feast of Booths was near .
NIRV	John	7	3	Jesus ’ brothers said to him , “ Leave Galilee and go to Judea . Then your disciples there will see the works that you do .
NIRV	John	7	4	No one who wants to be well known does things in secret . Since you are doing these things , show yourself to the world. ”
NIRV	John	7	5	Even Jesus ’ own brothers did not believe in him .
NIRV	John	7	6	So Jesus told them , “ The time for me to show who I really am is not here yet . For you , any time would be the right time .
NIRV	John	7	8	You go to the feast . I am not going up to this feast . This is because my time has not yet fully come. ”
NIRV	John	7	9	After he said this , he stayed in Galilee .
NIRV	John	7	10	But when his brothers had left for the feast , he went also . But he went secretly , not openly .
NIRV	John	7	11	At the feast the Jewish leaders were watching for Jesus . They were asking , “ Where is he ? ”
NIRV	John	7	12	Many people in the crowd were whispering about him . Some said , “ He is a good man. ” Others replied , “ No . He fools the people. ”
NIRV	John	7	13	But no one would say anything about him openly . They were afraid of the leaders . Jesus Teaches at the Feast
NIRV	John	7	14	Jesus did nothing until halfway through the feast . Then he went up to the temple courtyard and began to teach .
NIRV	John	7	15	The Jews there were amazed . They asked , “ How did this man learn so much without being taught ? ”
NIRV	John	7	16	Jesus answered , “ What I teach is not my own . It comes from the one who sent me .
NIRV	John	7	17	Here is how someone can find out whether my teaching comes from God or from me . That person must choose to do what God wants them to do .
NIRV	John	7	18	Whoever speaks on their own does it to get personal honor . But someone who works for the honor of the one who sent him is truthful . Nothing about him is false .
NIRV	John	7	19	Didn ’ t Moses give you the law ? But not one of you obeys the law . Why are you trying to kill me ? ”
NIRV	John	7	20	“ You are controlled by demons , ” the crowd answered . “ Who is trying to kill you ? ”
NIRV	John	7	21	Jesus said to them , “ I did one miracle , and you are all amazed .
NIRV	John	7	22	Moses gave you circumcision , and so you circumcise a child on the Sabbath day . But circumcision did not really come from Moses . It came from Abraham .
NIRV	John	7	23	You circumcise a boy on the Sabbath day . You think that if you do , you won ’ t break the law of Moses . Then why are you angry with me ? I healed a man ’ s entire body on the Sabbath day !
NIRV	John	7	24	Stop judging only by what you see . Judge in the right way. ” People Don ’ t Agree About Who Jesus Is
NIRV	John	7	25	Then some of the people of Jerusalem began asking questions . They said , “ Isn ’ t this the man some people are trying to kill ?
NIRV	John	7	26	Here he is ! He is speaking openly . They aren ’ t saying a word to him . Have the authorities really decided that he is the Messiah ?
NIRV	John	7	27	But we know where this man is from . When the Messiah comes , no one will know where he is from. ”
NIRV	John	7	28	Jesus was still teaching in the temple courtyard . He cried out , “ Yes , you know me . And you know where I am from . I am not here on my own authority . The one who sent me is true . You do not know him .
NIRV	John	7	29	But I know him . I am from him , and he sent me. ”
NIRV	John	7	30	When he said this , they tried to arrest him . But no one laid a hand on him . The time for him to show who he really was had not yet come .
NIRV	John	7	31	Still , many people in the crowd believed in him . They said , “ How will it be when the Messiah comes ? Will he do more signs than this man ? ”
NIRV	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering things like this about him . Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him .
NIRV	John	7	33	Jesus said , “ I am with you for only a short time . Then I will go to the one who sent me .
NIRV	John	7	34	You will look for me , but you won ’ t find me . You can ’ t come where I am going. ”
NIRV	John	7	35	The Jews said to one another , “ Where does this man plan to go ? Does he think we can ’ t find him ? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks ? Will he go there to teach the Greeks ?
NIRV	John	7	36	What did he mean when he said , ‘ You will look for me , but you won ’ t find me ’ ? And what did he mean when he said , ‘ You can ’ t come where I am going ’ ? ”
NIRV	John	7	37	It was the last and most important day of the feast . Jesus stood up and spoke in a loud voice . He said , “ Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink .
NIRV	John	7	38	Does anyone believe in me ? Then , just as Scripture says , rivers of living water will flow from inside them. ”
NIRV	John	7	39	When he said this , he meant the Holy Spirit . Those who believed in Jesus would receive the Spirit later . Up to that time , the Spirit had not been given . This was because Jesus had not yet received glory .
NIRV	John	7	40	The people heard his words . Some of them said , “ This man must be the Prophet we ’ ve been expecting. ”
NIRV	John	7	41	Others said , “ He is the Messiah. ” Still others asked , “ How can the Messiah come from Galilee ?
NIRV	John	7	42	Doesn ’ t Scripture say that the Messiah will come from the family line of David ? Doesn ’ t it say that he will come from Bethlehem , the town where David lived ? ”
NIRV	John	7	43	So the people did not agree about who Jesus was .
NIRV	John	7	44	Some wanted to arrest him . But no one laid a hand on him . The Jewish Leaders Do Not Believe
NIRV	John	7	45	Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and the Pharisees . They asked the guards , “ Why didn ’ t you bring him in ? ”
NIRV	John	7	46	“ No one ever spoke the way this man does , ” the guards replied .
NIRV	John	7	47	“ You mean he has fooled you also ? ” the Pharisees asked .
NIRV	John	7	48	“ Have any of the rulers or Pharisees believed in him ?
NIRV	John	7	49	No ! But this mob knows nothing about the law . There is a curse on them. ”
NIRV	John	7	50	Then Nicodemus , a Pharisee , spoke . He was the one who had gone to Jesus earlier . He asked ,
NIRV	John	7	51	“ Does our law find a man guilty without hearing him first ? Doesn ’ t it want to find out what he is doing ? ”
NIRV	John	7	52	They replied , “ Are you from Galilee too ? Look into it . You will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee. ”

NIRV	John	8	8	He bent down again and wrote on the ground .
NIRV	John	8	1	But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives .
NIRV	John	8	2	At sunrise he arrived again in the temple courtyard . All the people gathered around him there . He sat down to teach them .
NIRV	John	8	3	The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman . She had been caught committing adultery . They made her stand in front of the group .
NIRV	John	8	4	They said to Jesus , “ Teacher , this woman was caught sleeping with a man who was not her husband .
NIRV	John	8	5	In the Law , Moses commanded us to kill such women by throwing stones at them . Now what do you say ? ”
NIRV	John	8	6	They were trying to trap Jesus with that question . They wanted to have a reason to bring charges against him . But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger .
NIRV	John	8	7	They kept asking him questions . So he stood up and said to them , “ Has any one of you not sinned ? Then you be the first to throw a stone at her. ”
NIRV	John	8	9	Those who heard what he had said began to go away . They left one at a time , the older ones first . Soon only Jesus was left . The woman was still standing there .
NIRV	John	8	10	Jesus stood up and asked her , “ Woman , where are they ? Hasn ’ t anyone found you guilty ? ”
NIRV	John	8	11	“ No one , sir , ” she said . “ Then I don ’ t find you guilty either , ” Jesus said . “ Go now and leave your life of sin. ” Challenge to What Jesus Says About Himself
NIRV	John	8	12	Jesus spoke to the people again . He said , “ I am the light of the world . Anyone who follows me will never walk in darkness . They will have that light . They will have life. ”
NIRV	John	8	13	The Pharisees argued with him . “ Here you are , ” they said , “ appearing as your own witness . But your witness does not count. ”
NIRV	John	8	14	Jesus answered , “ Even if I am a witness about myself , what I say does count . I know where I came from . And I know where I am going . But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going .
NIRV	John	8	15	You judge by human standards . I don ’ t judge anyone .
NIRV	John	8	16	But if I do judge , what I decide is true . This is because I am not alone . I stand with the Father , who sent me .
NIRV	John	8	17	Your own Law says that the witness of two people proves the truth about something .
NIRV	John	8	18	I am a witness about myself . The other witness about me is the Father , who sent me. ”
NIRV	John	8	19	Then they asked him , “ Where is your father ? ” “ You do not know me or my Father , ” Jesus replied . “ If you knew me , you would know my Father also. ”
NIRV	John	8	20	He spoke these words while he was teaching in the temple courtyard . He was near the place where the offerings were put . But no one arrested him . That ’ s because the time for him to die had not yet come . Challenge to Who Jesus Claims to Be
NIRV	John	8	21	Once more Jesus said to them , “ I am going away . You will look for me , and you will die in your sin . You can ’ t come where I am going. ”
NIRV	John	8	22	This made the Jews ask , “ Will he kill himself ? Is that why he says , ‘ You can ’ t come where I am going ’ ? ”
NIRV	John	8	23	But Jesus said , “ You are from below . I am from heaven . You are from this world . I am not from this world .
NIRV	John	8	24	I told you that you would die in your sins . This will happen if you don ’ t believe that I am he . If you don ’ t believe , you will certainly die in your sins. ”
NIRV	John	8	25	“ Who are you ? ” they asked . “ Just what I have been telling you from the beginning , ” Jesus replied .
NIRV	John	8	26	“ I have a lot to say that will judge you . But the one who sent me can be trusted . And I tell the world what I have heard from him. ”
NIRV	John	8	27	They did not understand that Jesus was telling them about his Father .
NIRV	John	8	28	So Jesus said , “ You will lift up the Son of Man . Then you will know that I am he . You will also know that I do nothing on my own . I speak just what the Father has taught me .
NIRV	John	8	29	The one who sent me is with me . He has not left me alone , because I always do what pleases him. ”
NIRV	John	8	30	Even while Jesus was speaking , many people believed in him . Challenge to the Claim to Be Children of Abraham
NIRV	John	8	31	Jesus spoke to the Jews who had believed him . “ If you obey my teaching , ” he said , “ you are really my disciples .
NIRV	John	8	32	Then you will know the truth . And the truth will set you free. ”
NIRV	John	8	33	They answered him , “ We are Abraham ’ s children . We have never been slaves of anyone . So how can you say that we will be set free ? ”
NIRV	John	8	34	Jesus replied , “ What I ’ m about to tell you is true . Everyone who sins is a slave of sin .
NIRV	John	8	35	A slave has no lasting place in the family . But a son belongs to the family forever .
NIRV	John	8	36	So if the Son of Man sets you free , you will really be free .
NIRV	John	8	37	I know that you are Abraham ’ s children . But you are looking for a way to kill me . You have no room for my word .
NIRV	John	8	38	I am telling you what I saw when I was with my Father . You are doing what you have heard from your father . ”
NIRV	John	8	39	“ Abraham is our father , ” they answered . Jesus said , “ Are you really Abraham ’ s children ? If you are , you will do what Abraham did .
NIRV	John	8	40	But you are looking for a way to kill me . I am a man who has told you the truth I heard from God . Abraham didn ’ t do the things you want to do .
NIRV	John	8	41	You are doing what your own father does. ” “ We have the right to claim to be God ’ s children , ” they objected . “ The only Father we have is God himself. ”
NIRV	John	8	42	Jesus said to them , “ If God were your Father , you would love me . I have come here from God . I have not come on my own . God sent me .
NIRV	John	8	43	Why aren ’ t my words clear to you ? Because you can ’ t really hear what I say .
NIRV	John	8	44	You belong to your father , the devil . You want to obey your father ’ s wishes . From the beginning , the devil was a murderer . He has never obeyed the truth . There is no truth in him . When he lies , he speaks his natural language . He does this because he is a liar . He is the father of lies .
NIRV	John	8	45	But because I tell the truth , you don ’ t believe me !
NIRV	John	8	46	Can any of you prove I am guilty of sinning ? Am I not telling the truth ? Then why don ’ t you believe me ?
NIRV	John	8	47	Whoever belongs to God hears what God says . The reason you don ’ t hear is that you don ’ t belong to God. ” Jesus Makes Claims About Himself
NIRV	John	8	48	The Jews answered Jesus , “ Aren ’ t we right when we say you are a Samaritan ? Aren ’ t you controlled by a demon ? ”
NIRV	John	8	49	“ I am not controlled by a demon , ” said Jesus . “ I honor my Father . You do not honor me .
NIRV	John	8	50	years old , ” they said to Jesus . “ And you have seen Abraham ? ”
NIRV	John	8	51	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . Whoever obeys my word will never die. ”
NIRV	John	8	52	Then they cried out , “ Now we know you are controlled by a demon ! Abraham died . So did the prophets . But you say that whoever obeys your word will never die .
NIRV	John	8	53	Are you greater than our father Abraham ? He died . So did the prophets . Who do you think you are ? ”
NIRV	John	8	54	Jesus replied , “ If I bring glory to myself , my glory means nothing . You claim that my Father is your God . He is the one who brings glory to me .
NIRV	John	8	55	You do not know him . But I know him . If I said I did not , I would be a liar like you . But I do know him . And I obey his word .
NIRV	John	8	56	Your father Abraham was filled with joy at the thought of seeing my day . He saw it and was glad. ”
NIRV	John	8	57	“ You are not even
NIRV	John	8	58	“ What I ’ m about to tell you is true , ” Jesus answered . “ Before Abraham was born , I am ! ”
NIRV	John	8	59	When he said this , they picked up stones to kill him . But Jesus hid himself . He slipped away from the temple area . Copyright ©

NIRV	John	9	9	Some claimed that he was . Others said , “ No . He only looks like him. ” But the man who had been blind kept saying , “ I am the man. ”
NIRV	John	9	2	Jesus ’ disciples asked him , “ Rabbi , who sinned ? Was this man born blind because he sinned ? Or did his parents sin ? ”
NIRV	John	9	3	“ It isn ’ t because this man sinned , ” said Jesus . “ It isn ’ t because his parents sinned . He was born blind so that God ’ s power could be shown by what ’ s going to happen .
NIRV	John	9	4	While it is still day , we must do the works of the one who sent me . Night is coming . Then no one can work .
NIRV	John	9	5	While I am in the world , I am the light of the world. ”
NIRV	John	9	6	After he said this , he spit on the ground . He made some mud with the spit . Then he put the mud on the man ’ s eyes .
NIRV	John	9	7	“ Go , ” he told him . “ Wash in the Pool of Siloam. ” Siloam means Sent . So the man went and washed . And he came home able to see .
NIRV	John	9	8	His neighbors and people who had seen him earlier begging asked questions . “ Isn ’ t this the same man who used to sit and beg ? ” they asked .
NIRV	John	9	10	“ Then how were your eyes opened ? ” they asked .
NIRV	John	9	11	He replied , “ The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes . He told me to go to Siloam and wash . So I went and washed . Then I could see. ”
NIRV	John	9	12	“ Where is this man ? ” they asked him . “ I don ’ t know , ” he said . The Pharisees Want to Know How the Blind Man Was Healed
NIRV	John	9	13	They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind .
NIRV	John	9	14	The day Jesus made the mud and opened the man ’ s eyes was a Sabbath day .
NIRV	John	9	15	So the Pharisees also asked him how he was able to see . “ He put mud on my eyes , ” the man replied . “ Then I washed . And now I can see. ”
NIRV	John	9	16	Some of the Pharisees said , “ Jesus has not come from God . He does not keep the Sabbath day. ” But others asked , “ How can a sinner do such signs ? ” So the Pharisees did not agree with one another .
NIRV	John	9	17	Then they turned again to the blind man . “ What do you have to say about him ? ” they asked . “ It was your eyes he opened. ” The man replied , “ He is a prophet. ”
NIRV	John	9	18	They still did not believe that the man had been blind and now could see . So they sent for his parents .
NIRV	John	9	19	“ Is this your son ? ” they asked . “ Is this the one you say was born blind ? How is it that now he can see ? ”
NIRV	John	9	20	“ We know he is our son , ” the parents answered . “ And we know he was born blind .
NIRV	John	9	21	But we don ’ t know how he can now see . And we don ’ t know who opened his eyes . Ask him . He is an adult . He can speak for himself. ”
NIRV	John	9	22	His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders . The leaders had already made this decision about Jesus . Anyone who said Jesus was the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue .
NIRV	John	9	23	That was why the man ’ s parents said , “ He is an adult . Ask him. ”
NIRV	John	9	24	Again the Pharisees called the man who had been blind to come to them . “ Give glory to God by telling the truth ! ” they said . “ We know that the man who healed you is a sinner. ”
NIRV	John	9	25	He replied , “ I don ’ t know if he is a sinner or not . I do know one thing . I was blind , but now I can see ! ”
NIRV	John	9	26	Then they asked him , “ What did he do to you ? How did he open your eyes ? ”
NIRV	John	9	27	He answered , “ I have already told you . But you didn ’ t listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you want to become his disciples too ? ”
NIRV	John	9	28	Then they began to attack him with their words . “ You are this fellow ’ s disciple ! ” they said . “ We are disciples of Moses !
NIRV	John	9	29	We know that God spoke to Moses . But we don ’ t even know where this fellow comes from. ”
NIRV	John	9	30	The man answered , “ That is really surprising ! You don ’ t know where he comes from , and yet he opened my eyes .
NIRV	John	9	31	We know that God does not listen to sinners . He listens to the godly person who does what he wants them to do .
NIRV	John	9	32	Nobody has ever heard of anyone opening the eyes of a person born blind .
NIRV	John	9	33	If this man had not come from God , he could do nothing. ”
NIRV	John	9	34	Then the Pharisees replied , “ When you were born , you were already deep in sin . How dare you talk like that to us ! ” And they threw him out of the synagogue . People Who Can ’ t See the Truth
NIRV	John	9	35	Jesus heard that the Pharisees had thrown the man out of the synagogue . When Jesus found him , he said , “ Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ”
NIRV	John	9	36	“ Who is he , sir ? ” the man asked . “ Tell me , so I can believe in him. ”
NIRV	John	9	37	Jesus said , “ You have now seen him . In fact , he is the one speaking with you. ”
NIRV	John	9	38	Then the man said , “ Lord , I believe. ” And he worshiped him .
NIRV	John	9	39	Jesus said , “ I have come into this world to judge it . I have come so that people who are blind will see . I have come so that people who can see will become blind. ”
NIRV	John	9	40	Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this . They asked , “ What ? Are we blind too ? ”
NIRV	John	9	41	Jesus said , “ If you were blind , you would not be guilty of sin . But since you claim you can see , you remain guilty . Copyright ©

NIRV	John	10	10	A thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy . I have come so they may have life . I want them to have it in the fullest possible way .
NIRV	John	10	2	The one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep .
NIRV	John	10	3	The gatekeeper opens the gate for him . The sheep listen to his voice . He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
NIRV	John	10	4	When he has brought out all his own sheep , he goes on ahead of them . His sheep follow him because they know his voice .
NIRV	John	10	5	But they will never follow a stranger . In fact , they will run away from him . They don ’ t recognize a stranger ’ s voice. ”
NIRV	John	10	6	Jesus told this story . But the Pharisees didn ’ t understand what he was telling them .
NIRV	John	10	7	So Jesus said again , “ What I ’ m about to tell you is true . I am like a gate for the sheep .
NIRV	John	10	8	All who have come before me are thieves and robbers . But the sheep have not listened to them .
NIRV	John	10	9	I ’ m like a gate . Anyone who enters through me will be saved . They will come in and go out . And they will find plenty of food .
NIRV	John	10	11	“ I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd gives his life for the sheep .
NIRV	John	10	12	The hired man is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep . So when the hired man sees the wolf coming , he leaves the sheep and runs away . Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it .
NIRV	John	10	13	The man runs away because he is a hired man . He does not care about the sheep .
NIRV	John	10	14	“ I am the good shepherd . I know my sheep , and my sheep know me .
NIRV	John	10	15	They know me just as the Father knows me and I know the Father . And I give my life for the sheep .
NIRV	John	10	16	I have other sheep that do not belong to this sheep pen . I must bring them in too . They also will listen to my voice . Then there will be one flock and one shepherd .
NIRV	John	10	17	The reason my Father loves me is that I give up my life . But I will take it back again .
NIRV	John	10	18	No one takes it from me . I give it up myself . I have the authority to give it up . And I have the authority to take it back again . I received this command from my Father. ”
NIRV	John	10	19	The Jews who heard these words could not agree with one another .
NIRV	John	10	20	Many of them said , “ He is controlled by a demon . He has gone crazy ! Why should we listen to him ? ”
NIRV	John	10	21	But others said , “ A person controlled by a demon does not say things like this . Can a demon open the eyes of someone who is blind ? ” Another Challenge to Jesus ’ Claims
NIRV	John	10	22	Then came the Feast of Hanukkah at Jerusalem . It was winter .
NIRV	John	10	23	Jesus was in the temple courtyard walking in Solomon ’ s Porch .
NIRV	John	10	24	The Jews who were gathered there around Jesus spoke to him . They said , “ How long will you keep us waiting ? If you are the Messiah , tell us plainly. ”
NIRV	John	10	25	Jesus answered , “ I did tell you . But you do not believe . The works that I do in my Father ’ s name are a witness for me .
NIRV	John	10	26	But you do not believe , because you are not my sheep .
NIRV	John	10	27	My sheep listen to my voice . I know them , and they follow me .
NIRV	John	10	28	I give them eternal life , and they will never die . No one will steal them out of my hand .
NIRV	John	10	29	My Father , who has given them to me , is greater than anyone . No one can steal them out of my Father ’ s hand .
NIRV	John	10	30	I and the Father are one. ”
NIRV	John	10	31	Again the Jews who had challenged him picked up stones to kill him .
NIRV	John	10	32	But Jesus said to them , “ I have shown you many good works from the Father . Which good work are you throwing stones at me for ? ”
NIRV	John	10	33	“ We are not throwing stones at you for any good work , ” they replied . “ We are stoning you for saying a very evil thing . You are only a man . But you claim to be God. ”
NIRV	John	10	34	Jesus answered them , “ Didn ’ t God say in your Law , ‘ I have said you are “ gods ” ’ ? ( Psalm 82:6 )
NIRV	John	10	35	We know that Scripture is always true . God spoke to some people and called them ‘ gods. ’
NIRV	John	10	36	If that is true , what about the one the Father set apart as his very own ? What about this one the Father sent into the world ? Why do you charge me with saying a very evil thing ? Is it because I said , ‘ I am God ’ s Son ’ ?
NIRV	John	10	37	Don ’ t believe me unless I do the works of my Father .
NIRV	John	10	38	But what if I do them ? Even if you don ’ t believe me , believe these works . Then you will know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father. ”
NIRV	John	10	39	Again they tried to arrest him . But he escaped from them .
NIRV	John	10	40	Then Jesus went back across the Jordan River . He went to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days . There he stayed .
NIRV	John	10	41	Many people came to him . They said , “ John never performed a sign . But everything he said about this man was true. ”
NIRV	John	10	42	And in that place many believed in Jesus . Copyright ©

NIRV	John	11	11	After he said this , Jesus went on speaking to them . “ Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep , ” he said . “ But I am going there to wake him up. ”
NIRV	John	11	2	Mary would later pour perfume on the Lord . She would also wipe Jesus ’ feet with her hair . It was her brother Lazarus who was sick in bed .
NIRV	John	11	3	So the sisters sent a message to Jesus . “ Lord , ” they told him , “ the one you love is sick. ”
NIRV	John	11	4	When Jesus heard this , he said , “ This sickness will not end in death . No , it is for God ’ s glory . God ’ s Son will receive glory because of it. ”
NIRV	John	11	5	Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
NIRV	John	11	6	So after he heard Lazarus was sick , he stayed where he was for two more days .
NIRV	John	11	7	And then he said to his disciples , “ Let us go back to Judea. ”
NIRV	John	11	8	“ But Rabbi , ” they said , “ a short time ago the Jews there tried to kill you with stones . Are you still going back ? ”
NIRV	John	11	9	Jesus answered , “ Aren ’ t there
NIRV	John	11	12	His disciples replied , “ Lord , if he ’ s sleeping , he will get better. ”
NIRV	John	11	10	But when they walk at night , they ’ ll trip and fall . They have no light. ”
NIRV	John	11	13	Jesus had been speaking about the death of Lazarus . But his disciples thought he meant natural sleep .
NIRV	John	11	14	So then he told them plainly , “ Lazarus is dead .
NIRV	John	11	15	For your benefit , I am glad I was not there . Now you will believe . But let us go to him. ”
NIRV	John	11	16	Then Thomas , who was also called Didymus , spoke to the rest of the disciples . “ Let us go also , ” he said . “ Then we can die with Jesus. ” Jesus Comforts the Sisters of Lazarus
NIRV	John	11	17	When Jesus arrived , he found out that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days .
NIRV	John	11	18	Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem .
NIRV	John	11	19	Many Jews had come to Martha and Mary . They had come to comfort them because their brother was dead .
NIRV	John	11	20	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went out to meet him . But Mary stayed at home .
NIRV	John	11	21	“ Lord , ” Martha said to Jesus , “ I wish you had been here ! Then my brother would not have died .
NIRV	John	11	22	But I know that even now God will give you anything you ask for. ”
NIRV	John	11	23	Jesus said to her , “ Your brother will rise again. ”
NIRV	John	11	24	Martha answered , “ I know he will rise again . This will happen when people are raised from the dead on the last day. ”
NIRV	John	11	25	Jesus said to her , “ I am the resurrection and the life . Anyone who believes in me will live , even if they die .
NIRV	John	11	26	And whoever lives by believing in me will never die . Do you believe this ? ”
NIRV	John	11	27	“ Yes , Lord , ” she replied . “ I believe that you are the Messiah , the Son of God . I believe that you are the one who is supposed to come into the world. ”
NIRV	John	11	28	After she said this , she went back home . She called her sister Mary to one side to talk to her . “ The Teacher is here , ” Martha said . “ He is asking for you. ”
NIRV	John	11	29	When Mary heard this , she got up quickly and went to him .
NIRV	John	11	30	Jesus had not yet entered the village . He was still at the place where Martha had met him .
NIRV	John	11	31	Some Jews had been comforting Mary in the house . They noticed how quickly she got up and went out . So they followed her . They thought she was going to the tomb to mourn there .
NIRV	John	11	32	Mary reached the place where Jesus was . When she saw him , she fell at his feet . She said , “ Lord , I wish you had been here ! Then my brother would not have died. ”
NIRV	John	11	33	Jesus saw her crying . He saw that the Jews who had come along with her were crying also . His spirit became very sad , and he was troubled .
NIRV	John	11	34	“ Where have you put him ? ” he asked . “ Come and see , Lord , ” they replied .
NIRV	John	11	35	Jesus wept .
NIRV	John	11	36	Then the Jews said , “ See how much he loved him ! ”
NIRV	John	11	37	But some of them said , “ He opened the eyes of the blind man . Couldn ’ t he have kept this man from dying ? ” Jesus Raises Lazarus From the Dead
NIRV	John	11	38	Once more Jesus felt very sad . He came to the tomb . It was a cave with a stone in front of the entrance .
NIRV	John	11	39	“ Take away the stone , ” he said . “ But , Lord , ” said Martha , the sister of the dead man , “ by this time there is a bad smell . Lazarus has been in the tomb for four days. ”
NIRV	John	11	40	Then Jesus said , “ Didn ’ t I tell you that if you believe , you will see God ’ s glory ? ”
NIRV	John	11	41	So they took away the stone . Then Jesus looked up . He said , “ Father , I thank you for hearing me .
NIRV	John	11	42	I know that you always hear me . But I said this for the benefit of the people standing here . I said it so they will believe that you sent me. ”
NIRV	John	11	43	Then Jesus called in a loud voice . He said , “ Lazarus , come out ! ”
NIRV	John	11	44	The dead man came out . His hands and feet were wrapped with strips of linen . A cloth was around his face . Jesus said to them , “ Take off the clothes he was buried in and let him go. ” The Plan to Kill Jesus
NIRV	John	11	45	Many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary saw what Jesus did . So they believed in him .
NIRV	John	11	46	But some of them went to the Pharisees . They told the Pharisees what Jesus had done .
NIRV	John	11	47	Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin . “ What can we do ? ” they asked . “ This man is performing many signs .
NIRV	John	11	48	If we let him keep on doing this , everyone will believe in him . Then the Romans will come . They will take away our temple and our nation. ”
NIRV	John	11	49	One of the Jewish leaders spoke up . His name was Caiaphas . He was high priest at that time . He said , “ You don ’ t know anything at all !
NIRV	John	11	50	You don ’ t realize what is good for you . It is better if one man dies for the people than if the whole nation is destroyed. ”
NIRV	John	11	51	He did not say this on his own because he was high priest at that time . He prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation .
NIRV	John	11	52	He also prophesied that Jesus would die for God ’ s children scattered everywhere . He would die to bring them together and make them one .
NIRV	John	11	53	So from that day on , the Jewish rulers planned to kill Jesus .
NIRV	John	11	54	Jesus no longer moved around openly among the people of Judea . Instead , he went away to an area near the desert . He went to a village called Ephraim . There he stayed with his disciples .
NIRV	John	11	55	It was almost time for the Jewish Passover Feast . Many people went up from the country to Jerusalem . They went there for the special washing that would make them pure before the Passover Feast .
NIRV	John	11	56	They kept looking for Jesus as they stood in the temple courtyard . They asked one another , “ What do you think ? Isn ’ t he coming to the feast at all ? ”
NIRV	John	11	57	But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders . They had commanded anyone who found out where Jesus was staying to report it . Then they could arrest him . Copyright ©

NIRV	John	12	12	The next day the large crowd that had come for the feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem .
NIRV	John	12	2	A dinner was given at Bethany to honor Jesus . Martha served the food . Lazarus was among the people at the table with Jesus .
NIRV	John	12	3	Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard . It was an expensive perfume . She poured it on Jesus ’ feet and wiped them with her hair . The house was filled with the sweet smell of the perfume .
NIRV	John	12	4	But Judas Iscariot didn ’ t like what Mary did . He was one of Jesus ’ disciples . Later he was going to hand Jesus over to his enemies . Judas said ,
NIRV	John	12	5	“ Why wasn ’ t this perfume sold ? Why wasn ’ t the money given to poor people ? It was worth a year ’ s pay. ”
NIRV	John	12	6	He didn ’ t say this because he cared about the poor . He said it because he was a thief . Judas was in charge of the money bag . He used to help himself to what was in it .
NIRV	John	12	7	“ Leave her alone , ” Jesus replied . “ The perfume was meant for the day I am buried .
NIRV	John	12	8	You will always have the poor among you . But you won ’ t always have me. ”
NIRV	John	12	9	Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there , so they came . But they did not come only because of Jesus . They also came to see Lazarus . After all , Jesus had raised him from the dead .
NIRV	John	12	10	So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus too .
NIRV	John	12	11	Because of Lazarus , many of the Jews were starting to follow Jesus . They were believing in him . Jesus Comes to Jerusalem as King
NIRV	John	12	13	So they took branches from palm trees and went out to meet him . They shouted , “ Hosanna ! ” “ Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! ” ( Psalm 118:25,26 ) “ Blessed is the king of Israel ! ”
NIRV	John	12	14	Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it . This is just as it is written in Scripture . It says ,
NIRV	John	12	15	“ City of Zion , do not be afraid . See , your king is coming . He is sitting on a donkey ’ s colt. ” ( Zechariah 9:9 )
NIRV	John	12	16	At first , Jesus ’ disciples did not understand all this . They realized it only after he had received glory . Then they realized that these things had been written about him . They realized that these things had been done to him .
NIRV	John	12	17	A crowd had been with Jesus when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead . So they continued to tell everyone about what had happened .
NIRV	John	12	18	Many people went out to meet him . They had heard that he had done this sign .
NIRV	John	12	19	So the Pharisees said to one another , “ This isn ’ t getting us anywhere . Look how the whole world is following him ! ” Jesus Tells About His Coming Death
NIRV	John	12	20	There were some Greeks among the people who went up to worship during the feast .
NIRV	John	12	21	They came to ask Philip for a favor . Philip was from Bethsaida in Galilee . “ Sir , ” they said , “ we would like to see Jesus. ”
NIRV	John	12	22	Philip went to tell Andrew . Then Andrew and Philip told Jesus .
NIRV	John	12	23	Jesus replied , “ The time has come for the Son of Man to receive glory .
NIRV	John	12	24	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . Unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies , it remains only one seed . But if it dies , it produces many seeds .
NIRV	John	12	25	Anyone who loves their life will lose it . But anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it and have eternal life .
NIRV	John	12	26	Anyone who serves me must follow me . And where I am , my servant will also be . My Father will honor the one who serves me .
NIRV	John	12	27	“ My soul is troubled . What should I say ? ‘ Father , keep me from having to go through with this ’ ? No . This is the very reason I have come to this point in my life .
NIRV	John	12	28	Father , bring glory to your name ! ” Then a voice came from heaven . It said , “ I have brought glory to my name . I will bring glory to it again. ”
NIRV	John	12	29	The crowd there heard the voice . Some said it was thunder . Others said an angel had spoken to Jesus .
NIRV	John	12	30	Jesus said , “ This voice was for your benefit , not mine .
NIRV	John	12	31	Now it is time for the world to be judged . Now the prince of this world will be thrown out .
NIRV	John	12	32	And I am going to be lifted up from the earth . When I am , I will bring all people to myself. ”
NIRV	John	12	33	He said this to show them how he was going to die .
NIRV	John	12	34	The crowd spoke up . “ The Law tells us that the Messiah will remain forever , ” they said . “ So how can you say , ‘ The Son of Man must be lifted up ’ ? Who is this ‘ Son of Man ’ ? ”
NIRV	John	12	35	Then Jesus told them , “ You are going to have the light just a little while longer . Walk while you have the light . Do this before darkness catches up with you . Whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going .
NIRV	John	12	36	While you have the light , believe in it . Then you can become children of light. ” When Jesus had finished speaking , he left and hid from them . Some Jews Believe and Some Don ’ t
NIRV	John	12	37	Jesus had performed so many signs in front of them . But they still would not believe in him .
NIRV	John	12	38	This happened as Isaiah the prophet had said it would . He had said , “ Lord , who has believed what we ’ ve been saying ? Who has seen the Lord ’ s saving power ? ” ( Isaiah 53:1 )
NIRV	John	12	39	For this reason , they could not believe . As Isaiah says in another place ,
NIRV	John	12	40	“ The Lord has blinded their eyes . He has closed their minds . So they can ’ t see with their eyes . They can ’ t understand with their minds . They can ’ t turn to the Lord . If they could , he would heal them. ” ( Isaiah 6:10 )
NIRV	John	12	41	Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus ’ glory and spoke about him .
NIRV	John	12	42	At the same time that Jesus did those signs , many of the Jewish leaders believed in him . But because of the Pharisees , they would not openly admit they believed . They were afraid they would be thrown out of the synagogue .
NIRV	John	12	43	They loved praise from people more than praise from God .
NIRV	John	12	44	Then Jesus cried out , “ Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only . They also believe in the one who sent me .
NIRV	John	12	45	The one who looks at me sees the one who sent me .
NIRV	John	12	46	I have come into the world to be its light . So no one who believes in me will stay in darkness .
NIRV	John	12	47	“ I don ’ t judge a person who hears my words but does not obey them . I didn ’ t come to judge the world . I came to save the world .
NIRV	John	12	48	But there is a judge for anyone who does not accept me and my words . These words I have spoken will judge them on the last day .
NIRV	John	12	49	I did not speak on my own . The Father who sent me commanded me to say all that I have said .
NIRV	John	12	50	I know that his command leads to eternal life . So everything I say is just what the Father has told me to say. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	John	13	13	“ You call me ‘ Teacher ’ and ‘ Lord. ’ You are right . That is what I am .
NIRV	John	13	2	They were having their evening meal . The devil had already tempted Judas , son of Simon Iscariot . He had urged Judas to hand Jesus over to his enemies .
NIRV	John	13	3	Jesus knew that the Father had put everything under his power . He also knew he had come from God and was returning to God .
NIRV	John	13	4	So he got up from the meal and took off his outer clothes . He wrapped a towel around his waist .
NIRV	John	13	5	After that , he poured water into a large bowl . Then he began to wash his disciples ’ feet . He dried them with the towel that was wrapped around him .
NIRV	John	13	6	He came to Simon Peter . “ Lord , ” Peter said to him , “ are you going to wash my feet ? ”
NIRV	John	13	7	Jesus replied , “ You don ’ t realize now what I am doing . But later you will understand. ”
NIRV	John	13	8	“ No , ” said Peter . “ You will never wash my feet. ” Jesus answered , “ Unless I wash you , you can ’ t share life with me. ”
NIRV	John	13	9	“ Lord , ” Simon Peter replied , “ not just my feet ! Wash my hands and my head too ! ”
NIRV	John	13	10	Jesus answered , “ People who have had a bath need to wash only their feet . The rest of their body is clean . And you are clean . But not all of you are. ”
NIRV	John	13	11	Jesus knew who was going to hand him over to his enemies . That was why he said not every one was clean .
NIRV	John	13	12	When Jesus finished washing their feet , he put on his clothes . Then he returned to his place . “ Do you understand what I have done for you ? ” he asked them .
NIRV	John	13	14	I , your Lord and Teacher , have washed your feet . So you also should wash one another ’ s feet .
NIRV	John	13	15	I have given you an example . You should do as I have done for you .
NIRV	John	13	16	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . A slave is not more important than his master . And a messenger is not more important than the one who sends him .
NIRV	John	13	17	Now you know these things . So you will be blessed if you do them . Jesus Tells What Judas Will Do
NIRV	John	13	18	“ I am not talking about all of you . I know the ones I have chosen . But this will happen so that this passage of Scripture will come true . It says , ‘ The one who shared my bread has turned against me. ’ ( Psalm 41:9 )
NIRV	John	13	19	“ I am telling you now , before it happens . When it does happen , you will believe that I am who I am .
NIRV	John	13	20	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . Anyone who accepts someone I send accepts me . And anyone who accepts me accepts the one who sent me. ”
NIRV	John	13	21	After he had said this , Jesus ’ spirit was troubled . He said , “ What I ’ m about to tell you is true . One of you is going to hand me over to my enemies. ”
NIRV	John	13	22	His disciples stared at one another . They had no idea which one of them he meant .
NIRV	John	13	23	The disciple Jesus loved was next to him at the table .
NIRV	John	13	24	Simon Peter motioned to that disciple . He said , “ Ask Jesus which one he means. ”
NIRV	John	13	25	The disciple was leaning back against Jesus . He asked him , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
NIRV	John	13	26	Jesus answered , “ It is the one I will give this piece of bread to . I will give it to him after I have dipped it in the dish. ” He dipped the piece of bread . Then he gave it to Judas , son of Simon Iscariot .
NIRV	John	13	27	As soon as Judas took the bread , Satan entered into him . So Jesus told him , “ Do quickly what you are going to do. ”
NIRV	John	13	28	But no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him .
NIRV	John	13	29	Judas was in charge of the money . So some of the disciples thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the feast . Others thought Jesus was talking about giving something to poor people .
NIRV	John	13	30	As soon as Judas had taken the bread , he went out . And it was night . Peter Says He Does Not Know Jesus
NIRV	John	13	31	After Judas was gone , Jesus spoke . He said , “ Now the Son of Man receives glory . And he brings glory to God .
NIRV	John	13	32	If the Son brings glory to God , God himself will bring glory to the Son . God will do it at once .
NIRV	John	13	33	“ My children , I will be with you only a little longer . You will look for me . Just as I told the Jews , so I am telling you now . You can ’ t come where I am going .
NIRV	John	13	34	“ I give you a new command . Love one another . You must love one another , just as I have loved you .
NIRV	John	13	35	If you love one another , everyone will know you are my disciples. ”
NIRV	John	13	36	Simon Peter asked him , “ Lord , where are you going ? ” Jesus replied , “ Where I am going you can ’ t follow now . But you will follow me later. ”
NIRV	John	13	37	“ Lord , ” Peter asked , “ why can ’ t I follow you now ? I will give my life for you. ”
NIRV	John	13	38	Then Jesus answered , “ Will you really give your life for me ? What I ’ m about to tell you is true . Before the rooster crows , you will say three times that you don ’ t know me ! Copyright ©

NIRV	John	14	14	You may ask me for anything in my name . I will do it . Jesus Promises That the Holy Spirit Will Come
NIRV	John	14	2	There are many rooms in my Father ’ s house . If this were not true , would I have told you that I am going there ? Would I have told you that I would prepare a place for you there ?
NIRV	John	14	3	If I go and do that , I will come back . And I will take you to be with me . Then you will also be where I am .
NIRV	John	14	4	You know the way to the place where I am going. ” Jesus Is the Way to the Father
NIRV	John	14	5	Thomas said to him , “ Lord , we don ’ t know where you are going . So how can we know the way ? ”
NIRV	John	14	6	Jesus answered , “ I am the way and the truth and the life . No one comes to the Father except through me .
NIRV	John	14	7	If you really know me , you will know my Father also . From now on , you do know him . And you have seen him. ”
NIRV	John	14	8	Philip said , “ Lord , show us the Father . That will be enough for us. ”
NIRV	John	14	9	Jesus answered , “ Don ’ t you know me , Philip ? I have been among you such a long time ! Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father . So how can you say , ‘ Show us the Father ’ ?
NIRV	John	14	10	Don ’ t you believe that I am in the Father ? Don ’ t you believe that the Father is in me ? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority . The Father lives in me . He is the one who is doing his work .
NIRV	John	14	11	Believe me when I say I am in the Father . Also believe that the Father is in me . Or at least believe what the works I have been doing say about me .
NIRV	John	14	12	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . Anyone who believes in me will do the works I have been doing . In fact , they will do even greater things . That ’ s because I am going to the Father .
NIRV	John	14	13	And I will do anything you ask in my name . Then the Father will receive glory from the Son .
NIRV	John	14	15	“ If you love me , obey my commands .
NIRV	John	14	16	I will ask the Father . And he will give you another friend to help you and to be with you forever .
NIRV	John	14	17	That friend is the Spirit of truth . The world can ’ t accept him . That ’ s because the world does not see him or know him . But you know him . He lives with you , and he will be in you .
NIRV	John	14	18	I will not leave you like children who don ’ t have parents . I will come to you .
NIRV	John	14	19	Before long , the world will not see me anymore . But you will see me . Because I live , you will live also .
NIRV	John	14	20	On that day you will realize that I am in my Father . You will know that you are in me , and I am in you .
NIRV	John	14	21	Anyone who has my commands and obeys them loves me . My Father will love the one who loves me . I too will love them . And I will show myself to them. ”
NIRV	John	14	22	Then Judas spoke . “ Lord , ” he said , “ why do you plan to show yourself only to us ? Why not also to the world ? ” The Judas who spoke those words was not Judas Iscariot .
NIRV	John	14	23	Jesus replied , “ Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching . My Father will love them . We will come to them and make our home with them .
NIRV	John	14	24	Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching . The words you hear me say are not my own . They belong to the Father who sent me .
NIRV	John	14	25	“ I have spoken all these things while I am still with you .
NIRV	John	14	26	But the Father will send the Friend in my name to help you . The Friend is the Holy Spirit . He will teach you all things . He will remind you of everything I have said to you .
NIRV	John	14	27	I leave my peace with you . I give my peace to you . I do not give it to you as the world does . Do not let your hearts be troubled . And do not be afraid .
NIRV	John	14	28	“ You heard me say , ‘ I am going away . And I am coming back to you. ’ If you loved me , you would be glad I am going to the Father . The Father is greater than I am .
NIRV	John	14	29	I have told you now before it happens . Then when it does happen , you will believe .
NIRV	John	14	30	I will not say much more to you . The prince of this world is coming . He has no power over me .
NIRV	John	14	31	But he comes so that the world may learn that I love the Father . They must also learn that I do exactly what my Father has commanded me to do . “ Come now . Let us leave . Copyright ©

NIRV	John	15	15	I do not call you slaves anymore . Slaves do not know their master ’ s business . Instead , I have called you friends . I have told you everything I learned from my Father .
NIRV	John	15	2	He cuts off every branch joined to me that does not bear fruit . He trims every branch that does bear fruit . Then it will bear even more fruit .
NIRV	John	15	3	You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you .
NIRV	John	15	4	Remain joined to me , just as I also remain joined to you . No branch can bear fruit by itself . It must remain joined to the vine . In the same way , you can ’ t bear fruit unless you remain joined to me .
NIRV	John	15	5	“ I am the vine . You are the branches . If you remain joined to me , and I to you , you will bear a lot of fruit . You can ’ t do anything without me .
NIRV	John	15	6	If you don ’ t remain joined to me , you are like a branch that is thrown away and dries up . Branches like those are picked up . They are thrown into the fire and burned .
NIRV	John	15	7	If you remain joined to me and my words remain in you , ask for anything you wish . And it will be done for you .
NIRV	John	15	8	When you bear a lot of fruit , it brings glory to my Father . It shows that you are my disciples .
NIRV	John	15	9	“ Just as the Father has loved me , I have loved you . Now remain in my love .
NIRV	John	15	10	If you obey my commands , you will remain in my love . In the same way , I have obeyed my Father ’ s commands and remain in his love .
NIRV	John	15	11	I have told you this so that you will have the same joy that I have . I also want your joy to be complete .
NIRV	John	15	12	Here is my command . Love one another , just as I have loved you .
NIRV	John	15	13	No one has greater love than the one who gives their life for their friends .
NIRV	John	15	14	You are my friends if you do what I command .
NIRV	John	15	16	You did not choose me . Instead , I chose you . I appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit that will last . I also appointed you so that the Father will give you what you ask for . He will give you whatever you ask for in my name .
NIRV	John	15	17	Here is my command . Love one another . The World Hates the Disciples
NIRV	John	15	18	“ My disciples , does the world hate you ? Remember that it hated me first .
NIRV	John	15	19	If you belonged to the world , it would love you like one of its own . But you do not belong to the world . I have chosen you out of the world . That is why the world hates you .
NIRV	John	15	20	Remember what I told you . I said , ‘ A slave is not more important than his master. ’ ( John 13:16 ) If people hated me and tried to hurt me , they will do the same to you . If they obeyed my teaching , they will obey yours also .
NIRV	John	15	21	They will treat you like that because of my name . They do not know the one who sent me .
NIRV	John	15	22	If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not be guilty of sin . But now they have no excuse for their sin .
NIRV	John	15	23	Whoever hates me hates my Father also .
NIRV	John	15	24	I did works among them that no one else did . If I hadn ’ t , they would not be guilty of sin . But now they have seen those works . And still they have hated both me and my Father .
NIRV	John	15	25	This has happened so that what is written in their Law would come true . It says , ‘ They hated me without any reason. ’ ( Psalms 35:19 ; 69:4 ) The Work of the Holy Spirit
NIRV	John	15	26	“ I will send the Friend to you from the Father . He is the Spirit of truth , who comes out from the Father . When the Friend comes to help you , he will be a witness about me .

NIRV	John	16	16	Jesus continued , “ In a little while , you will no longer see me . Then after a little while , you will see me. ”
NIRV	John	16	2	You will be thrown out of the synagogue . In fact , the time is coming when someone may kill you . And they will think they are doing God a favor .
NIRV	John	16	3	They will do things like that because they do not know the Father or me .
NIRV	John	16	4	Why have I told you this ? So that when their time comes , you will remember that I warned you about them . I didn ’ t tell you this from the beginning because I was with you .
NIRV	John	16	5	But now I am going to the one who sent me . None of you asks me , ‘ Where are you going ? ’
NIRV	John	16	6	Instead , you are filled with sadness because I have said these things .
NIRV	John	16	7	But what I ’ m about to tell you is true . It is for your good that I am going away . Unless I go away , the Friend will not come to help you . But if I go , I will send him to you .
NIRV	John	16	8	When he comes , he will prove that the world ’ s people are guilty . He will prove their guilt concerning sin and godliness and judgment .
NIRV	John	16	9	The world is guilty as far as sin is concerned . That ’ s because people do not believe in me .
NIRV	John	16	10	The world is guilty as far as godliness is concerned . That ’ s because I am going to the Father , where you can ’ t see me anymore .
NIRV	John	16	11	The world is guilty as far as judgment is concerned . That ’ s because the devil , the prince of this world , has already been judged .
NIRV	John	16	12	“ I have much more to say to you . It is more than you can handle right now .
NIRV	John	16	13	But when the Spirit of truth comes , he will guide you into all the truth . He will not speak on his own . He will speak only what he hears . And he will tell you what is still going to happen .
NIRV	John	16	14	He will bring me glory . That ’ s because what he receives from me he will show to you .
NIRV	John	16	15	Everything that belongs to the Father is mine . That is why I said what the Holy Spirit receives from me he will show to you . The Disciples ’ Sadness Will Turn Into Joy
NIRV	John	16	17	After they heard this , some of his disciples spoke to one another . They said , “ What does he mean by saying , ‘ In a little while , you will no longer see me . Then after a little while , you will see me ’ ? And what does he mean by saying , ‘ I am going to the Father ’ ? ”
NIRV	John	16	18	They kept asking , “ What does he mean by ‘ a little while ’ ? We don ’ t understand what he is saying. ”
NIRV	John	16	19	Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about these things . So he said to them , “ Are you asking one another what I meant ? Didn ’ t you understand when I said , ‘ In a little while , you will no longer see me . Then after a little while , you will see me ’ ?
NIRV	John	16	20	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . You will weep and mourn while the world is full of joy . You will be sad , but your sadness will turn into joy .
NIRV	John	16	21	A woman giving birth to a baby has pain . That ’ s because her time to give birth has come . But when her baby is born , she forgets the pain . She forgets because she is so happy that a baby has been born into the world .
NIRV	John	16	22	That ’ s the way it is with you . Now it ’ s your time to be sad . But I will see you again . Then you will be full of joy . And no one will take away your joy .
NIRV	John	16	23	When that day comes , you will no longer ask me for anything . What I ’ m about to tell you is true . My Father will give you anything you ask for in my name .
NIRV	John	16	24	Until now you have not asked for anything in my name . Ask , and you will receive what you ask for . Then your joy will be complete .
NIRV	John	16	25	“ I have not been speaking to you plainly . But a time is coming when I will speak clearly . Then I will tell you plainly about my Father .
NIRV	John	16	26	When that day comes , you will ask for things in my name . I am not saying I will ask the Father instead of you asking him .
NIRV	John	16	27	No , the Father himself loves you because you have loved me . He also loves you because you have believed that I came from God .
NIRV	John	16	28	I came from the Father and entered the world . Now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father. ”
NIRV	John	16	29	Then Jesus ’ disciples said , “ Now you are speaking plainly . You are using examples that are clear .
NIRV	John	16	30	Now we can see that you know everything . You don ’ t even need anyone to ask you questions . This makes us believe that you came from God. ”
NIRV	John	16	31	“ Do you believe now ? ” Jesus replied .
NIRV	John	16	32	“ A time is coming when you will be scattered and go to your own homes . In fact , that time is already here . You will leave me all alone . But I am not really alone . My Father is with me .
NIRV	John	16	33	“ I have told you these things , so that you can have peace because of me . In this world you will have trouble . But be encouraged ! I have won the battle over the world. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	John	17	9	I pray for them . I am not praying for the world . I am praying for those you have given me , because they are yours .
NIRV	John	17	10	All I have is yours , and all you have is mine . Glory has come to me because of my disciples .
NIRV	John	17	11	I will not remain in the world any longer . But they are still in the world , and I am coming to you . Holy Father , keep them safe by the power of your name . It is the name you gave me . Keep them safe so they can be one , just as you and I are one .
NIRV	John	17	12	While I was with them , I guarded them . I kept them safe through the name you gave me . None of them has been lost , except the one who was headed for ruin . It happened so that Scripture would come true .
NIRV	John	17	13	“ I am coming to you now . But I say these things while I am still in the world . I say them so that those you gave me can have the same joy that I have .
NIRV	John	17	14	I have given them your word . The world has hated them . That ’ s because they are not part of the world any more than I am .
NIRV	John	17	15	I do not pray that you will take them out of the world . I pray that you will keep them safe from the evil one .
NIRV	John	17	16	They do not belong to the world , just as I do not belong to it .
NIRV	John	17	18	You sent me into the world . In the same way , I have sent them into the world .
NIRV	John	17	19	I make myself holy for them so that they too can be made holy by the truth . Jesus Prays for All Believers
NIRV	John	17	20	“ I do not pray only for them . I pray also for everyone who will believe in me because of their message .
NIRV	John	17	21	Father , I pray they will be one , just as you are in me and I am in you . I want them also to be in us . Then the world will believe that you have sent me .
NIRV	John	17	22	I have given them the glory you gave me . I did this so they would be one , just as we are one .
NIRV	John	17	23	I will be in them , just as you are in me . This is so that they may be brought together perfectly as one . Then the world will know that you sent me . It will also show the world that you have loved those you gave me , just as you have loved me .
NIRV	John	17	24	“ Father , I want those you have given me to be with me where I am . I want them to see my glory , the glory you have given me . You gave it to me because you loved me before the world was created .
NIRV	John	17	25	“ Father , you are holy . The world does not know you , but I know you . Those you have given me know you have sent me .

NIRV	John	18	2	Judas knew the place . He was going to hand Jesus over to his enemies . Jesus had often met in that place with his disciples .
NIRV	John	18	3	So Judas came to the garden . He was guiding a group of soldiers and some officials . The chief priests and the Pharisees had sent them . They were carrying torches , lanterns and weapons .

NIRV	John	18	9	This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken would come true . He had said , “ I have not lost anyone God has given me. ” ( John 6:39 )
NIRV	John	18	10	Simon Peter had a sword and pulled it out . He struck the high priest ’ s slave and cut off his right ear . The slave ’ s name was Malchus .
NIRV	John	18	11	Jesus commanded Peter , “ Put your sword away ! Shouldn ’ t I drink the cup of suffering the Father has given me ? ”
NIRV	John	18	12	Then the group of soldiers , their commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus . They tied him up
NIRV	John	18	13	and brought him first to Annas . He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , the high priest at that time .
NIRV	John	18	14	Caiaphas had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be good if one man died for the people . Peter Says He Is Not Jesus ’ Disciple
NIRV	John	18	15	Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus . The high priest knew the other disciple . So that disciple went with Jesus into the high priest ’ s courtyard .
NIRV	John	18	16	But Peter had to wait outside by the door . The other disciple came back . He was the one the high priest knew . He spoke to the servant woman who was on duty there . Then he brought Peter in .
NIRV	John	18	17	She asked Peter , “ You aren ’ t one of Jesus ’ disciples too , are you ? ” “ I am not , ” he replied .
NIRV	John	18	19	Meanwhile , the high priest questioned Jesus . He asked him about his disciples and his teaching .
NIRV	John	18	20	“ I have spoken openly to the world , ” Jesus replied . “ I always taught in synagogues or at the temple , where all the Jews come together . I didn ’ t say anything in secret .
NIRV	John	18	21	Why question me ? Ask the people who heard me . They certainly know what I said. ”
NIRV	John	18	22	When Jesus said that , one of the officials nearby slapped him in the face . “ Is this any way to answer the high priest ? ” he asked .
NIRV	John	18	23	“ Have I said something wrong ? ” Jesus replied . “ If I have , then tell everyone what it was . But if I spoke the truth , why did you hit me ? ”
NIRV	John	18	24	Annas sent him , tied up , to Caiaphas , the high priest . Peter Again Says He Is Not Jesus ’ Disciple
NIRV	John	18	25	Meanwhile , Simon Peter was still standing there warming himself by the fire . So they asked him , “ You aren ’ t one of Jesus ’ disciples too , are you ? ” He said , “ I am not. ”
NIRV	John	18	26	One of the high priest ’ s slaves was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off . He said to Peter , “ Didn ’ t I see you with Jesus in the garden ? ”
NIRV	John	18	27	Again Peter said no . At that exact moment a rooster began to crow . Jesus Is Brought to Pilate
NIRV	John	18	28	Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor . By now it was early morning . The Jewish leaders did not want to be made “ unclean. ” They wanted to be able to eat the Passover meal . So they did not enter the palace .
NIRV	John	18	29	Pilate came out to them . He asked , “ What charges are you bringing against this man ? ”
NIRV	John	18	30	“ He has committed crimes , ” they replied . “ If he hadn ’ t , we would not have handed him over to you. ”
NIRV	John	18	31	Pilate said , “ Take him yourselves . Judge him by your own law. ” “ But we don ’ t have the right to put anyone to death , ” they complained .
NIRV	John	18	32	This happened so that what Jesus said about how he was going to die would come true .
NIRV	John	18	33	Then Pilate went back inside the palace . He ordered Jesus to be brought to him . Pilate asked him , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ”
NIRV	John	18	34	“ Is that your own idea ? ” Jesus asked . “ Or did others talk to you about me ? ”
NIRV	John	18	35	“ Am I a Jew ? ” Pilate replied . “ Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me . What have you done ? ”
NIRV	John	18	36	Jesus said , “ My kingdom is not from this world . If it were , those who serve me would fight . They would try to keep the Jewish leaders from arresting me . My kingdom is from another place. ”
NIRV	John	18	37	“ So you are a king , then ! ” said Pilate . Jesus answered , “ You say that I am a king . In fact , that ’ s the reason I was born . I was born and came into the world to be a witness to the truth . Everyone who is on the side of truth listens to me. ”
NIRV	John	18	38	“ What is truth ? ” Pilate replied . Then Pilate went out again to the Jews gathered there . He said , “ I find no basis for any charge against him .
NIRV	John	18	39	But you have a practice at Passover time . At that time , you ask me to set one prisoner free for you . Do you want me to set ‘ the king of the Jews ’ free ? ”
NIRV	John	18	40	They shouted back , “ No ! Not him ! Give us Barabbas ! ” Barabbas had taken part in an armed struggle against the country ’ s rulers . Copyright ©

NIRV	John	19	19	Pilate had a notice prepared . It was fastened to the cross . It read , jesus of nazareth , the king of the jews .
NIRV	John	19	2	The soldiers twisted thorns together to make a crown . They put it on Jesus ’ head . Then they put a purple robe on him .
NIRV	John	19	3	They went up to him again and again . They kept saying , “ We honor you , king of the Jews ! ” And they slapped him in the face .
NIRV	John	19	4	Once more Pilate came out . He said to the Jews gathered there , “ Look , I am bringing Jesus out to you . I want to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him. ”
NIRV	John	19	5	Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . Then Pilate said to them , “ Here is the man ! ”
NIRV	John	19	6	As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him , they shouted , “ Crucify him ! Crucify him ! ” But Pilate answered , “ You take him and crucify him . I myself find no basis for a charge against him. ”
NIRV	John	19	7	The Jewish leaders replied , “ We have a law . That law says he must die . He claimed to be the Son of God. ”
NIRV	John	19	8	When Pilate heard that , he was even more afraid .
NIRV	John	19	9	He went back inside the palace . “ Where do you come from ? ” he asked Jesus . But Jesus did not answer him .
NIRV	John	19	10	“ Do you refuse to speak to me ? ” Pilate said . “ Don ’ t you understand ? I have the power to set you free or to nail you to a cross. ”
NIRV	John	19	11	Jesus answered , “ You were given power from heaven . If you weren ’ t , you would have no power over me . So the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin. ”
NIRV	John	19	12	From then on , Pilate tried to set Jesus free . But the Jewish leaders kept shouting , “ If you let this man go , you are not Caesar ’ s friend ! Anyone who claims to be a king is against Caesar ! ”
NIRV	John	19	13	When Pilate heard that , he brought Jesus out . Pilate sat down on the judge ’ s seat . It was at a place called the Stone Walkway . In the Aramaic language it was called Gabbatha .
NIRV	John	19	14	It was about noon on Preparation Day in Passover Week . “ Here is your king , ” Pilate said to the Jews .
NIRV	John	19	15	But they shouted , “ Take him away ! Take him away ! Crucify him ! ” “ Should I crucify your king ? ” Pilate asked . “ We have no king but Caesar , ” the chief priests answered .
NIRV	John	19	16	Finally , Pilate handed Jesus over to them to be nailed to a cross . Jesus Is Nailed to a Cross So the soldiers took charge of Jesus .
NIRV	John	19	17	He had to carry his own cross . He went out to a place called the Skull . In the Aramaic language it was called Golgotha .
NIRV	John	19	18	There they nailed Jesus to the cross . Two other men were crucified with him . One was on each side of him . Jesus was in the middle .
NIRV	John	19	20	Many of the Jews read the sign . That ’ s because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city . And the sign was written in the Aramaic , Latin and Greek languages .
NIRV	John	19	21	The chief priests of the Jews argued with Pilate . They said , “ Do not write ‘ The King of the Jews. ’ Write that this man claimed to be king of the Jews. ”
NIRV	John	19	22	Pilate answered , “ I have written what I have written. ”
NIRV	John	19	23	When the soldiers crucified Jesus , they took his clothes . They divided them into four parts . Each soldier got one part . All that was left was Jesus ’ long , inner robe . It did not have any seams . It was made out of one piece of cloth from top to bottom .
NIRV	John	19	24	“ Let ’ s not tear it , ” they said to one another . “ Let ’ s cast lots to see who will get it. ” This happened so that Scripture would come true . It says , “ They divided up my clothes among them . They cast lots for what I was wearing. ” ( Psalm 22:18 ) So that is what the soldiers did .
NIRV	John	19	25	Jesus ’ mother stood near his cross . So did his mother ’ s sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
NIRV	John	19	26	Jesus saw his mother there . He also saw the disciple he loved standing nearby . Jesus said to his mother , “ Dear woman , here is your son. ”
NIRV	John	19	27	He said to the disciple , “ Here is your mother. ” From that time on , the disciple took her into his home . Jesus Dies
NIRV	John	19	28	Later , Jesus knew that everything had now been finished . He also knew that what Scripture said must come true . So he said , “ I am thirsty. ”
NIRV	John	19	29	A jar of wine vinegar was there . So they soaked a sponge in it . They put the sponge on the stem of a hyssop plant . Then they lifted it up to Jesus ’ lips .
NIRV	John	19	30	After Jesus drank he said , “ It is finished. ” Then he bowed his head and died .
NIRV	John	19	31	It was Preparation Day . The next day would be a special Sabbath day . The Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath day . So they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down .
NIRV	John	19	32	The soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus . Then they broke the legs of the other man .
NIRV	John	19	33	But when they came to Jesus , they saw that he was already dead . So they did not break his legs .
NIRV	John	19	34	Instead , one of the soldiers stuck his spear into Jesus ’ side . Right away , blood and water flowed out .
NIRV	John	19	35	The man who saw it has been a witness about it . And what he has said is true . He knows that he tells the truth . He is a witness so that you also may believe .
NIRV	John	19	36	These things happened in order that Scripture would come true . It says , “ Not one of his bones will be broken. ” ( Exodus 12:46 ; Numbers 9:12 ; Psalm 34:20 )
NIRV	John	19	37	Scripture also says , “ They will look to the one they have pierced. ” ( Zechariah 12:10 ) Jesus Is Buried
NIRV	John	19	38	Later Joseph asked Pilate for Jesus ’ body . Joseph was from the town of Arimathea . He was a follower of Jesus . But he followed Jesus secretly because he was afraid of the Jewish leaders . After Pilate gave him permission , Joseph came and took the body away .
NIRV	John	19	39	Nicodemus went with Joseph . He was the man who had earlier visited Jesus at night . Nicodemus brought some mixed spices that weighed about
NIRV	John	19	75	pounds .
NIRV	John	19	40	The two men took Jesus ’ body . They wrapped it in strips of linen cloth , along with the spices . That was the way the Jews buried people .
NIRV	John	19	41	At the place where Jesus was crucified , there was a garden . A new tomb was there . No one had ever been put in it before .
NIRV	John	19	42	That day was the Jewish Preparation Day , and the tomb was nearby . So they placed Jesus there . Copyright ©

NIRV	John	20	20	Then he showed them his hands and his side . The disciples were very happy when they saw the Lord .
NIRV	John	20	2	So she ran to Simon Peter and another disciple , the one Jesus loved . She said , “ They have taken the Lord out of the tomb ! We don ’ t know where they have put him ! ”
NIRV	John	20	3	So Peter and the other disciple started out for the tomb .
NIRV	John	20	4	Both of them were running . The other disciple ran faster than Peter . He reached the tomb first .
NIRV	John	20	5	He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there . But he did not go in .
NIRV	John	20	6	Then Simon Peter came along behind him . He went straight into the tomb . He saw the strips of linen lying there .
NIRV	John	20	7	He also saw the funeral cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus ’ head . The cloth was still lying in its place . It was separate from the linen .
NIRV	John	20	8	The disciple who had reached the tomb first also went inside . He saw and believed .
NIRV	John	20	9	They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead .
NIRV	John	20	10	Then the disciples went back to where they were staying . Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene
NIRV	John	20	11	But Mary stood outside the tomb crying . As she cried , she bent over to look into the tomb .
NIRV	John	20	12	disciples . He was also called Didymus . He was not with the other disciples when Jesus came .
NIRV	John	20	13	They asked her , “ Woman , why are you crying ? ” “ They have taken my Lord away , ” she said . “ I don ’ t know where they have put him. ”
NIRV	John	20	14	Then she turned around and saw Jesus standing there . But she didn ’ t realize that it was Jesus .
NIRV	John	20	15	He asked her , “ Woman , why are you crying ? Who are you looking for ? ” She thought he was the gardener . So she said , “ Sir , did you carry him away ? Tell me where you put him . Then I will go and get him. ”
NIRV	John	20	16	Jesus said to her , “ Mary. ” She turned toward him . Then she cried out in the Aramaic language , “ Rabboni ! ” Rabboni means Teacher .
NIRV	John	20	17	Jesus said , “ Do not hold on to me . I have not yet ascended to the Father . Instead , go to those who believe in me . Tell them , ‘ I am ascending to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God. ’ ”
NIRV	John	20	18	Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news . She said , “ I have seen the Lord ! ” And she told them that he had said these things to her . Jesus Appears to His Disciples
NIRV	John	20	19	On the evening of that first day of the week , the disciples were together . They had locked the doors because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders . Jesus came in and stood among them . He said , “ May peace be with you ! ”
NIRV	John	20	21	Again Jesus said , “ May peace be with you ! The Father has sent me . So now I am sending you. ”
NIRV	John	20	22	He then breathed on them . He said , “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
NIRV	John	20	23	If you forgive anyone ’ s sins , their sins are forgiven . If you do not forgive them , they are not forgiven. ” Jesus Appears to Thomas
NIRV	John	20	24	Thomas was one of the
NIRV	John	20	25	So they told him , “ We have seen the Lord ! ” But he said to them , “ First I must see the nail marks in his hands . I must put my finger where the nails were . I must put my hand into his side . Only then will I believe. ”
NIRV	John	20	26	A week later , Jesus ’ disciples were in the house again . Thomas was with them . Even though the doors were locked , Jesus came in and stood among them . He said , “ May peace be with you ! ”
NIRV	John	20	27	Then he said to Thomas , “ Put your finger here . See my hands . Reach out your hand and put it into my side . Stop doubting and believe. ”
NIRV	John	20	28	Thomas said to him , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
NIRV	John	20	29	Then Jesus told him , “ Because you have seen me , you have believed . Blessed are those who have not seen me but still have believed. ” The Purpose of John ’ s Gospel
NIRV	John	20	30	Jesus performed many other signs in front of his disciples . They are not written down in this book .
NIRV	John	20	31	But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah , the Son of God . If you believe this , you will have life because you belong to him . Copyright ©

NIRV	John	21	21	When Peter saw that disciple , he asked , “ Lord , what will happen to him ? ”
NIRV	John	21	2	Simon Peter and Thomas , who was also called Didymus , were there together . Nathanael from Cana in Galilee and the sons of Zebedee were with them . So were two other disciples .
NIRV	John	21	3	“ I ’ m going out to fish , ” Simon Peter told them . They said , “ We ’ ll go with you. ” So they went out and got into the boat . That night they didn ’ t catch anything .
NIRV	John	21	4	Early in the morning , Jesus stood on the shore . But the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus .
NIRV	John	21	5	He called out to them , “ Friends , don ’ t you have any fish ? ” “ No , ” they answered .
NIRV	John	21	6	He said , “ Throw your net on the right side of the boat . There you will find some fish. ” When they did , they could not pull the net into the boat . There were too many fish in it .
NIRV	John	21	7	Then the disciple Jesus loved said to Simon Peter , “ It is the Lord ! ” As soon as Peter heard that , he put his coat on . He had taken it off earlier . Then he jumped into the water .
NIRV	John	21	8	The other disciples followed in the boat . They were towing the net full of fish . The shore was only about
NIRV	John	21	100	yards away .
NIRV	John	21	9	When they landed , they saw a fire of burning coals . There were fish on it . There was also some bread .
NIRV	John	21	10	Jesus said to them , “ Bring some of the fish you have just caught. ”
NIRV	John	21	11	So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat . He dragged the net to shore . It was full of large fish . There were
NIRV	John	21	153	of them . But even with that many fish the net was not torn .
NIRV	John	21	12	Jesus said to them , “ Come and have breakfast. ” None of the disciples dared to ask him , “ Who are you ? ” They knew it was the Lord .
NIRV	John	21	13	Jesus came , took the bread and gave it to them . He did the same thing with the fish .
NIRV	John	21	14	This was the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead . Jesus Gives Peter His Task
NIRV	John	21	15	When Jesus and the disciples had finished eating , Jesus spoke to Simon Peter . He asked , “ Simon , son of John , do you love me more than these others do ? ” “ Yes , Lord , ” he answered . “ You know that I love you. ” Jesus said , “ Feed my lambs. ”
NIRV	John	21	16	Again Jesus asked , “ Simon , son of John , do you love me ? ” He answered , “ Yes , Lord . You know that I love you. ” Jesus said , “ Take care of my sheep. ”
NIRV	John	21	17	Jesus spoke to him a third time . He asked , “ Simon , son of John , do you love me ? ” Peter felt bad because Jesus asked him the third time , “ Do you love me ? ” He answered , “ Lord , you know all things . You know that I love you. ” Jesus said , “ Feed my sheep .
NIRV	John	21	18	What I ’ m about to tell you is true . When you were younger , you dressed yourself . You went wherever you wanted to go . But when you are old , you will stretch out your hands . Someone else will dress you . Someone else will lead you where you do not want to go. ”
NIRV	John	21	19	Jesus said this to point out how Peter would die . His death would bring glory to God . Then Jesus said to him , “ Follow me ! ”
NIRV	John	21	20	Peter turned around . He saw that the disciple Jesus loved was following them . He was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper . He had said , “ Lord , who is going to hand you over to your enemies ? ”
NIRV	John	21	22	Jesus answered , “ Suppose I want him to remain alive until I return . What does that matter to you ? You must follow me. ”
NIRV	John	21	23	Because of what Jesus said , a false report spread among the believers . The story was told that the disciple Jesus loved wouldn ’ t die . But Jesus did not say he would not die . He only said , “ Suppose I want him to remain alive until I return . What does that matter to you ? ”
NIRV	John	21	24	This is the disciple who is a witness about these things . He also wrote them down . We know that what he says is true .
NIRV	John	21	25	Jesus also did many other things . What if every one of them were written down ? I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written . Copyright ©

NIRV	Romans	1	1	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I serve Christ Jesus . I have been appointed to be an apostle . God set me apart to tell others his good news .
NIRV	Romans	1	2	He promised the good news long ago . He announced it through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures .
NIRV	Romans	1	3	The good news is about God ’ s Son . He was born into the family line of King David .
NIRV	Romans	1	4	By the Holy Spirit , he was appointed to be the mighty Son of God . God did this by raising him from the dead . He is Jesus Christ our Lord .
NIRV	Romans	1	5	We received grace because of what Jesus did . He made us apostles to the Gentiles . We must invite all of them to obey God by trusting in Jesus . We do this to bring glory to him .
NIRV	Romans	1	6	You also are among those Gentiles who are appointed to belong to Jesus Christ .
NIRV	Romans	1	7	I am sending this letter to all of you in Rome . You are loved by God and appointed to be his holy people . May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace . Paul Longs to Visit Rome
NIRV	Romans	1	8	First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you . People all over the world are talking about your faith .
NIRV	Romans	1	9	I serve God with my whole heart . I preach the good news about his Son . God knows that I always remember you
NIRV	Romans	1	10	in my prayers . I pray that now at last it may be God ’ s plan to open the way for me to visit you .
NIRV	Romans	1	11	I long to see you . I want to make you strong by giving you a gift from the Holy Spirit .
NIRV	Romans	1	12	I want us to encourage one another in the faith we share .
NIRV	Romans	1	13	Brothers and sisters , I want you to know that I planned many times to visit you . But until now I have been kept from coming . My work has produced results among the other Gentiles . In the same way , I want to see results among you .
NIRV	Romans	1	14	I have a duty both to Greeks and to non-Greeks . I have a duty both to wise people and to foolish people .
NIRV	Romans	1	15	So I really want to preach the good news also to you who live in Rome .
NIRV	Romans	1	16	I want to preach it because I ’ m not ashamed of the good news . It is God ’ s power to save everyone who believes . It is meant first for the Jews . It is meant also for the Gentiles .
NIRV	Romans	1	17	The good news shows God ’ s power to make people right with himself . God ’ s power to be made right with him is given to the person who has faith . It happens by faith from beginning to end . It is written , “ The one who is right with God will live by faith. ” ( Habakkuk 2:4 ) God ’ s Anger Against Sinners
NIRV	Romans	1	18	God shows his anger from heaven . It is against all the godless and evil things people do . They are so evil that they say no to the truth .
NIRV	Romans	1	19	The truth about God is plain to them . God has made it plain .
NIRV	Romans	1	20	Ever since the world was created it has been possible to see the qualities of God that are not seen . I ’ m talking about his eternal power and about the fact that he is God . Those things can be seen in what he has made . So people have no excuse for what they do .
NIRV	Romans	1	21	They knew God . But they didn ’ t honor him as God . They didn ’ t thank him . Their thinking became worthless . Their foolish hearts became dark .
NIRV	Romans	1	22	They claimed to be wise . But they made fools of themselves .
NIRV	Romans	1	23	They would rather have statues of gods than the glorious God who lives forever . Their statues of gods are made to look like people , birds , animals and reptiles .
NIRV	Romans	1	24	So God let them go . He allowed them to do what their sinful hearts wanted to . He let them commit sexual sins . They made one another ’ s bodies impure by what they did .
NIRV	Romans	1	25	They chose a lie instead of the truth about God . They worshiped and served created things . They didn ’ t worship the Creator . But he is praised forever . Amen .
NIRV	Romans	1	26	So God let them continue to have their shameful desires . Their women committed sexual acts that were not natural .
NIRV	Romans	1	27	In the same way , the men turned away from their natural love for women . They burned with sexual desire for each other . Men did shameful things with other men . They suffered in their bodies for all the wrong things they did .
NIRV	Romans	1	28	They didn ’ t think it was important to know God . So God let them continue to have evil thoughts . They did things they shouldn ’ t do .
NIRV	Romans	1	29	They are full of every kind of sin , evil and ungodliness . They want more than they need . They commit murder . They want what belongs to other people . They fight and cheat . They hate others . They say mean things about other people .
NIRV	Romans	1	30	They tell lies about them . They hate God . They are rude and proud . They brag . They think of new ways to do evil . They don ’ t obey their parents .
NIRV	Romans	1	31	They do not understand . They can ’ t be trusted . They are not loving and kind .
NIRV	Romans	1	32	They know that God ’ s commands are right . They know that those who do evil things should die . But they continue to do those very things . They also approve of others who do them . Copyright ©

NIRV	Romans	2	2	We know that when God judges those who do evil things , he judges fairly .
NIRV	Romans	2	3	Though you are only a human being , you judge others . But you yourself do the same things . So how do you think you will escape when God judges you ?
NIRV	Romans	2	4	Do you disrespect God ’ s great kindness and favor ? Do you disrespect God when he is patient with you ? Don ’ t you realize that God ’ s kindness is meant to turn you away from your sins ?
NIRV	Romans	2	5	But you are stubborn . In your heart you are not sorry for your sins . You are storing up anger against yourself . The day of God ’ s anger is coming . Then his way of judging fairly will be shown .
NIRV	Romans	2	6	God “ will pay back each person in keeping with what they have done. ” ( Psalm 62:12 ; Proverbs 24:12 )
NIRV	Romans	2	7	God will give eternal life to those who keep on doing good . They want glory , honor , and life that never ends .
NIRV	Romans	2	8	But there are others who only look out for themselves . They don ’ t accept the truth . They go astray . God will pour out his great anger on them .
NIRV	Romans	2	9	There will be trouble and suffering for everyone who does evil . That is meant first for the Jews . It is also meant for the Gentiles .
NIRV	Romans	2	10	But there will be glory , honor and peace for everyone who does good . That is meant first for the Jews . It is also meant for the Gentiles .
NIRV	Romans	2	11	God treats everyone the same .
NIRV	Romans	2	12	Some people do not know God ’ s law when they sin . They will not be judged by the law when they die . Others do know God ’ s law when they sin . They will be judged by the law .
NIRV	Romans	2	13	Hearing the law does not make a person right with God . People are considered to be right with God only when they obey the law .
NIRV	Romans	2	14	Gentiles do not have the law . Sometimes they just naturally do what the law requires . They are a law for themselves . This is true even though they don ’ t have the law .
NIRV	Romans	2	15	They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts . The way their minds judge them proves this fact . Sometimes their thoughts find them guilty . At other times their thoughts find them not guilty .
NIRV	Romans	2	16	This will happen on the day God appoints Jesus Christ to judge people ’ s secret thoughts . That ’ s part of my good news . The Jews and the Law
NIRV	Romans	2	17	Suppose you call yourself a Jew . You trust in the law . You brag that you know God .
NIRV	Romans	2	18	You know what God wants . You agree with what is best because the law teaches you .
NIRV	Romans	2	19	You think you know so much more than the people you teach . You think you ’ re helping blind people . You think you are a light for those in the dark .
NIRV	Romans	2	20	You think you can make foolish people wise . You act like you ’ re teaching little children . You think that the law gives you all knowledge and truth .
NIRV	Romans	2	21	You claim to teach others , but you don ’ t even teach yourself ! You preach against stealing . But you steal !
NIRV	Romans	2	22	You say that people should not commit adultery . But you commit adultery ! You hate statues of gods . But you rob temples !
NIRV	Romans	2	23	You brag about the law . But when you break it , you rob God of his honor !
NIRV	Romans	2	24	It is written , “ The Gentiles say evil things against God ’ s name because of you. ” ( Isaiah 52:5 ; Ezekiel 36:22 )
NIRV	Romans	2	25	Circumcision has value if you obey the law . But if you break the law , it is just as if you hadn ’ t been circumcised .
NIRV	Romans	2	26	And sometimes those who aren ’ t circumcised do what the law requires . Won ’ t God accept them as if they had been circumcised ?
NIRV	Romans	2	27	Many are not circumcised physically , but they obey the law . They will prove that you are guilty . You are breaking the law , even though you have the written law and are circumcised .
NIRV	Romans	2	28	A person is not a Jew if they are a Jew only on the outside . And circumcision is more than just something done to the outside of a man ’ s body .
NIRV	Romans	2	29	No , a person is a Jew only if they are a Jew on the inside . And true circumcision means that the heart has been circumcised by the Holy Spirit . The person whose heart has been circumcised does more than obey the written law . The praise that matters for that kind of person does not come from other people . It comes from God . Copyright ©

NIRV	Romans	3	3	What if some Jews were not faithful ? Will the fact that they weren ’ t faithful keep God from being faithful ?
NIRV	Romans	3	2	There is great value in every way ! First of all , the Jews have been given the very words of God .
NIRV	Romans	3	4	Not at all ! God is true , even if every human being is a liar . It is written , “ You are right when you sentence me . You are fair when you judge me. ” ( Psalm 51:4 )
NIRV	Romans	3	5	Doesn ’ t the fact that we are wrong prove more clearly that God is right ? Then what can we say ? Can we say that God is not fair when he brings his anger down on us ? As you can tell , I am just using human ways of thinking .
NIRV	Romans	3	6	God is certainly fair ! If he weren ’ t , how could he judge the world ?
NIRV	Romans	3	7	Someone might argue , “ When I lie , it becomes clearer that God is truthful . It makes his glory shine more brightly . Why then does he find me guilty of sin ? ”
NIRV	Romans	3	8	Why not say , “ Let ’ s do evil things so that good things will happen ” ? Some people actually lie by reporting that this is what we say . They are the ones who will rightly be found guilty . No One Is Right With God
NIRV	Romans	3	9	What should we say then ? Do we Jews have any advantage ? Not at all ! We have already claimed that Jews and Gentiles are sinners . Everyone is under the power of sin .
NIRV	Romans	3	10	It is written , “ No one is right with God , no one at all .
NIRV	Romans	3	11	No one understands . No one trusts in God .
NIRV	Romans	3	12	All of them have turned away . They have all become worthless . No one does anything good , no one at all. ” ( Psalms 14:1–3 ; 53:1–3 ; Ecclesiastes 7:20 )
NIRV	Romans	3	13	“ Their throats are like open graves . With their tongues they tell lies. ” ( Psalm 5:9 ) “ The words from their lips are like the poison of a snake. ” ( Psalm 140:3 )
NIRV	Romans	3	14	“ Their mouths are full of curses and bitterness. ” ( Psalm 10:7 )
NIRV	Romans	3	15	“ They run quickly to commit murder .
NIRV	Romans	3	16	They leave a trail of harmful actions .
NIRV	Romans	3	17	They do not know how to live in peace. ” ( Isaiah 59:7,8 )
NIRV	Romans	3	18	“ They don ’ t have any respect for God. ” ( Psalm 36:1 )
NIRV	Romans	3	19	What the law says , it says to those who are ruled by the law . Its purpose is to shut every mouth and make the whole world accountable to God .
NIRV	Romans	3	20	So no one will be considered right with God by obeying the law . Instead , the law makes us more aware of our sin . Becoming Right With God by Faith
NIRV	Romans	3	21	But now God has shown us his saving power without the help of the law . But the Law and the Prophets tell us about this .
NIRV	Romans	3	22	We are made right with God by putting our faith in Jesus Christ . This happens to all who believe . It is no different for the Jews than for the Gentiles .
NIRV	Romans	3	23	Everyone has sinned . No one measures up to God ’ s glory .
NIRV	Romans	3	24	The free gift of God ’ s grace makes us right with him . Christ Jesus paid the price to set us free .
NIRV	Romans	3	25	God gave Christ as a sacrifice to pay for sins through the spilling of his blood . So God forgives the sins of those who have faith . God did all this to prove that he does what is right . He is a God of mercy . So he did not punish for their sins the people who lived before Jesus lived .
NIRV	Romans	3	26	God did all this to prove in our own time that he does what is right . He also makes right with himself those who believe in Jesus .
NIRV	Romans	3	27	So who can brag ? No one ! Are people saved by the law that requires them to obey ? Not at all ! They are saved because of the law that requires faith .
NIRV	Romans	3	28	We firmly believe that a person is made right with God because of their faith . They are not saved by obeying the law .
NIRV	Romans	3	29	Or is God the God of Jews only ? Isn ’ t he also the God of Gentiles ? Yes , he is their God too .
NIRV	Romans	3	30	There is only one God . When those who are circumcised believe in him , he makes them right with himself . Suppose those who are not circumcised believe in him . Then God also will make them right with himself .
NIRV	Romans	3	31	Does faith make the law useless ? Not at all ! We agree with the law . Copyright ©

NIRV	Romans	4	4	When a person works , their pay is not considered a gift . It is owed to them .
NIRV	Romans	4	2	Did he become right with God because of something he did ? If so , he could brag about it . But he couldn ’ t brag to God .
NIRV	Romans	4	3	What do we find in Scripture ? It says , “ Abraham believed God . God accepted Abraham ’ s faith , and so his faith made him right with God. ” ( Genesis 15:6 )
NIRV	Romans	4	5	But things are different with God . He makes ungodly people right with himself . If people trust in him , their faith is accepted even though they do not work . Their faith makes them right with God .
NIRV	Romans	4	6	King David says the same thing . He tells us how blessed people are when God makes them right with himself . They are blessed because they don ’ t have to do anything in return . David says ,
NIRV	Romans	4	7	“ Blessed are those whose lawless acts are forgiven . Blessed are those whose sins are taken away .
NIRV	Romans	4	8	Blessed is the person whose sin the Lord never counts against them. ” ( Psalm 32:1,2 )
NIRV	Romans	4	9	Is that blessing only for those who are circumcised ? Or is it also for those who are not circumcised ? We have been saying that God accepted Abraham ’ s faith . So his faith made him right with God .
NIRV	Romans	4	10	When did it happen ? Was it after Abraham was circumcised , or before ? It was before he was circumcised , not after !
NIRV	Romans	4	11	He was circumcised as a sign of the covenant God had made with him . It showed that his faith had made him right with God before he was circumcised . So Abraham is the father of all believers who have not been circumcised . God accepts their faith . So their faith makes them right with him .
NIRV	Romans	4	12	And Abraham is also the father of those who are circumcised and believe . So just being circumcised is not enough . Those who are circumcised must also follow the steps of our father Abraham . He had faith before he was circumcised .
NIRV	Romans	4	13	Abraham and his family received a promise . God promised that Abraham would receive the world . It would not come to him because he obeyed the law . It would come because of his faith , which made him right with God .
NIRV	Romans	4	14	Do those who depend on the law receive the promise ? If they do , faith would mean nothing . God ’ s promise would be worthless .
NIRV	Romans	4	15	The law brings God ’ s anger . Where there is no law , the law can ’ t be broken .
NIRV	Romans	4	16	The promise is based on God ’ s grace . The promise comes by faith . All of Abraham ’ s children will certainly receive the promise . And it is not only for those who are ruled by the law . Those who have the same faith that Abraham had are also included . He is the father of us all .
NIRV	Romans	4	17	It is written , “ I have made you a father of many nations. ” ( Genesis 17:5 ) God considers Abraham to be our father . The God that Abraham believed in gives life to the dead . Abraham ’ s God also creates things that did not exist before .
NIRV	Romans	4	18	When there was no reason for hope , Abraham believed because he had hope . He became the father of many nations , exactly as God had promised . God said , “ That is how many children you will have. ” ( Genesis 15:5 )
NIRV	Romans	4	19	Abraham did not become weak in his faith . He accepted the fact that he was past the time when he could have children . At that time Abraham was about
NIRV	Romans	4	100	years old . He also realized that Sarah was too old to have children .
NIRV	Romans	4	20	But Abraham kept believing in God ’ s promise . He became strong in his faith . He gave glory to God .
NIRV	Romans	4	21	He was absolutely sure that God had the power to do what he had promised .
NIRV	Romans	4	22	That ’ s why “ God accepted Abraham because he believed . So his faith made him right with God. ” ( Genesis 15:6 )
NIRV	Romans	4	23	The words “ God accepted Abraham ’ s faith ” were written not only for Abraham .
NIRV	Romans	4	24	They were written also for us . We believe in the God who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead . So God will accept our faith and make us right with himself .
NIRV	Romans	4	25	Jesus was handed over to die for our sins . He was raised to life in order to make us right with God . Copyright ©

NIRV	Romans	5	5	And hope will never bring us shame . That ’ s because God ’ s love has been poured into our hearts . This happened through the Holy Spirit , who has been given to us .
NIRV	Romans	5	2	Through faith in Jesus we have received God ’ s grace . In that grace we stand . We are full of joy because we expect to share in God ’ s glory .
NIRV	Romans	5	3	And that ’ s not all . We are full of joy even when we suffer . We know that our suffering gives us the strength to go on .
NIRV	Romans	5	4	The strength to go on produces character . Character produces hope .
NIRV	Romans	5	6	At just the right time Christ died for ungodly people . He died for us when we had no power of our own .
NIRV	Romans	5	7	It is unusual for anyone to die for a godly person . Maybe someone would be willing to die for a good person .
NIRV	Romans	5	8	But here is how God has shown his love for us . While we were still sinners , Christ died for us .
NIRV	Romans	5	9	The blood of Christ has made us right with God . So we are even more sure that Jesus will save us from God ’ s anger .
NIRV	Romans	5	10	Once we were God ’ s enemies . But we have been brought back to him because his Son has died for us . Now that God has brought us back , we are even more secure . We know that we will be saved because Christ lives .
NIRV	Romans	5	11	And that is not all . We are full of joy in God because of our Lord Jesus Christ . Because of him , God has brought us back to himself . Death Through Adam , Life Through Christ
NIRV	Romans	5	12	Sin entered the world because one man sinned . And death came because of sin . Everyone sinned , so death came to all people .
NIRV	Romans	5	13	Before the law was given , sin was in the world . This is certainly true . But people are not judged for sin when there is no law .
NIRV	Romans	5	14	Death ruled from the time of Adam to the time of Moses . Death ruled even over those who did not sin as Adam did . He broke God ’ s command . But Adam also became a pattern of the Messiah . The Messiah was the one who was going to come .
NIRV	Romans	5	15	God ’ s gift can ’ t be compared with Adam ’ s sin . Many people died because of the sin of that one man . But it was even more sure that God ’ s grace would also come through one man . That man is Jesus Christ . God ’ s gift of grace was more than enough for the whole world .
NIRV	Romans	5	16	The result of God ’ s gift is different from the result of Adam ’ s sin . That one sin brought God ’ s judgment . But after many sins , God ’ s gift made people right with him .
NIRV	Romans	5	17	One man sinned , and death ruled over all people because of his sin . What will happen is even more sure than this . Those who receive the rich supply of God ’ s grace will rule with Christ . They will rule in his kingdom . They have received God ’ s gift and have been made right with him . This will happen because of what the one man , Jesus Christ , has done .
NIRV	Romans	5	18	So one man ’ s sin brought guilt to all people . In the same way , one right act made people right with God . That one right act gave life to all people .
NIRV	Romans	5	19	Many people were made sinners because one man did not obey . But one man did obey . That is why many people will be made right with God .
NIRV	Romans	5	20	The law was given so that sin would increase . But where sin increased , God ’ s grace increased even more .
NIRV	Romans	5	21	Sin ruled and brought death . But grace rules in the lives of those who are right with God . The grace of God brings eternal life . That ’ s because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done . Copyright ©

NIRV	Romans	6	6	We know that what we used to be was nailed to the cross with him . That happened so our bodies that were ruled by sin would lose their power . So we are no longer slaves of sin .
NIRV	Romans	6	2	Not at all ! As far as sin is concerned , we are dead . So how can we keep on sinning ?
NIRV	Romans	6	3	All of us were baptized into Christ Jesus . Don ’ t you know that we were baptized into his death ?
NIRV	Romans	6	4	By being baptized , we were buried with Christ into his death . Christ has been raised from the dead by the Father ’ s glory . And like Christ we also can live a new life .
NIRV	Romans	6	5	By being baptized , we have been joined with him in a death like his . So we will certainly also be joined with him in a resurrection like his .
NIRV	Romans	6	7	That ’ s because those who have died have been set free from sin .
NIRV	Romans	6	8	We died with Christ . So we believe that we will also live with him .
NIRV	Romans	6	9	We know that Christ was raised from the dead and will never die again . Death doesn ’ t control him anymore .
NIRV	Romans	6	10	When he died , he died once and for all time . He did this to break the power of sin . Now that he lives , he lives in the power of God .
NIRV	Romans	6	11	In the same way , consider yourselves to be dead as far as sin is concerned . Now you believe in Christ Jesus . So consider yourselves to be alive as far as God is concerned .
NIRV	Romans	6	12	So don ’ t let sin rule your body , which is going to die . Don ’ t obey its evil desires .
NIRV	Romans	6	13	Don ’ t give any part of yourself to serve sin . Don ’ t let any part of yourself be used to do evil . Instead , give yourselves to God . You have been brought from death to life . So give every part of yourself to God to do what is right .
NIRV	Romans	6	14	Sin will no longer control you like a master . That ’ s because the law does not rule you . God ’ s grace has set you free . Slaves to Right Living
NIRV	Romans	6	15	What should we say then ? Should we sin because we are not ruled by the law but by God ’ s grace ? Not at all !
NIRV	Romans	6	16	Don ’ t you know that when you give yourselves to obey someone you become that person ’ s slave ? If you are slaves of sin , then you will die . But if you are slaves who obey God , then you will live a godly life .
NIRV	Romans	6	17	You used to be slaves of sin . But thank God that with your whole heart you obeyed the teachings you were given !
NIRV	Romans	6	18	You have been set free from sin . You have become slaves to right living .
NIRV	Romans	6	19	Because you are human , you find this hard to understand . So I am using an everyday example to help you understand . You used to give yourselves to be slaves to unclean living . You were becoming more and more evil . Now give yourselves to be slaves to right living . Then you will become holy .
NIRV	Romans	6	20	Once you were slaves of sin . At that time right living did not control you .
NIRV	Romans	6	21	What benefit did you gain from doing the things you are now ashamed of ? Those things lead to death !
NIRV	Romans	6	22	You have been set free from sin . God has made you his slaves . The benefit you gain leads to holy living . And the end result is eternal life .
NIRV	Romans	6	23	When you sin , the pay you get is death . But God gives you the gift of eternal life . That ’ s because of what Christ Jesus our Lord has done . Copyright ©

NIRV	Romans	7	7	What should we say then ? That the law is sinful ? Not at all ! Yet I wouldn ’ t have known what sin was unless the law had told me . The law says , “ Do not want what belongs to other people. ” ( Exodus 20:17 ; Deuteronomy 5:21 ) If the law hadn ’ t said that , I would not have known what it was like to want what belongs to others .
NIRV	Romans	7	2	For example , by law a married woman remains married as long as her husband lives . But suppose her husband dies . Then the law that joins her to him no longer applies .
NIRV	Romans	7	3	But suppose that married woman sleeps with another man while her husband is still alive . Then she is called a woman who commits adultery . But suppose her husband dies . Then she is free from that law . She is not guilty of adultery if she marries another man .
NIRV	Romans	7	4	My brothers and sisters , when Christ died you also died as far as the law is concerned . Then it became possible for you to belong to him . He was raised from the dead . Now our lives can be useful to God .
NIRV	Romans	7	5	The power of sin used to control us . The law stirred up sinful desires in us . So the things we did resulted in death .
NIRV	Romans	7	6	But now we have died to what used to control us . We have been set free from the law . Now we serve in the new way of the Holy Spirit . We no longer serve in the old way of the written law . The Law and Sin
NIRV	Romans	7	8	But the commandment gave sin an opportunity . Sin caused me to want all kinds of things that belong to others . A person can ’ t sin by breaking a law if that law doesn ’ t exist .
NIRV	Romans	7	9	Before I knew about the law , I was alive . But then the commandment came . Sin came to life , and I died .
NIRV	Romans	7	10	I found that the commandment that was supposed to bring life actually brought death .
NIRV	Romans	7	11	When the commandment gave sin the opportunity , sin tricked me . It used the commandment to put me to death .
NIRV	Romans	7	12	So the law is holy . The commandment also is holy and right and good .
NIRV	Romans	7	13	Did what is good cause me to die ? Not at all ! Sin had to be recognized for what it really is . So it used what is good to bring about my death . Because of the commandment , sin became totally sinful .
NIRV	Romans	7	14	We know that the law is holy . But I am not . I have been sold to be a slave of sin .
NIRV	Romans	7	15	I don ’ t understand what I do . I don ’ t do what I want to do . Instead , I do what I hate to do .
NIRV	Romans	7	16	I do what I don ’ t want to do . So I agree that the law is good .
NIRV	Romans	7	17	As it is , I am no longer the one who does these things . It is sin living in me that does them .
NIRV	Romans	7	18	I know there is nothing good in my desires controlled by sin . I want to do what is good , but I can ’ t .
NIRV	Romans	7	19	I don ’ t do the good things I want to do . I keep on doing the evil things I don ’ t want to do .
NIRV	Romans	7	20	I do what I don ’ t want to do . But I am not really the one who is doing it . It is sin living in me that does it .
NIRV	Romans	7	21	Here is the law I find working in me . When I want to do good , evil is right there with me .
NIRV	Romans	7	22	Deep inside me I find joy in God ’ s law .
NIRV	Romans	7	23	But I see another law working in me . It fights against the law of my mind . It makes me a prisoner of the law of sin . That law controls me .
NIRV	Romans	7	24	What a terrible failure I am ! Who will save me from this sin that brings death to my body ?
NIRV	Romans	7	25	I give thanks to God who saves me . He saves me through Jesus Christ our Lord . So in my mind I am a slave to God ’ s law . But sin controls my desires . So I am a slave to the law of sin . Copyright ©

NIRV	Romans	8	8	Those who are under the power of sin can ’ t please God .
NIRV	Romans	8	2	Because of what Christ Jesus has done , you are free . You are now controlled by the law of the Holy Spirit who gives you life . The law of the Spirit frees you from the law of sin that brings death .
NIRV	Romans	8	3	The written law was made weak by the power of sin . But God did what the written law could not do . He made his Son to be like those who live under the power of sin . God sent him to be an offering for sin . Jesus suffered God ’ s judgment against our sin .
NIRV	Romans	8	4	Jesus does for us everything the holy law requires . The power of sin should no longer control the way we live . The Holy Spirit should control the way we live .
NIRV	Romans	8	5	So don ’ t live under the control of sin . If you do , you will think about what sin wants . Live under the control of the Holy Spirit . If you do , you will think about what the Spirit wants .
NIRV	Romans	8	6	The thoughts of a person ruled by sin bring death . But the mind ruled by the Spirit brings life and peace .
NIRV	Romans	8	7	The mind ruled by the power of sin is at war with God . It does not obey God ’ s law . It can ’ t .
NIRV	Romans	8	9	But you are not ruled by the power of sin . Instead , the Holy Spirit rules over you . This is true if the Spirit of God lives in you . Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to Christ .
NIRV	Romans	8	10	If Christ lives in you , you will live . Though your body will die because of sin , the Spirit gives you life . The Spirit does this because you have been made right with God .
NIRV	Romans	8	11	The Spirit of the God who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you . So the God who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your bodies . He will do this because of his Spirit who lives in you .
NIRV	Romans	8	12	Brothers and sisters , we have a duty . Our duty is not to live under the power of sin .
NIRV	Romans	8	13	If you live under the power of sin , you will die . But by the Spirit ’ s power you can put to death the sins you commit . Then you will live .
NIRV	Romans	8	14	Those who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God .
NIRV	Romans	8	15	The Spirit you received doesn ’ t make you slaves . Otherwise you would live in fear again . Instead , the Holy Spirit you received made you God ’ s adopted child . By the Spirit ’ s power we call God Abba . Abba means Father .
NIRV	Romans	8	16	The Spirit himself joins with our spirits . Together they tell us that we are God ’ s children .
NIRV	Romans	8	17	As his children , we will receive all that he has for us . We will share what Christ receives . But we must share in his sufferings if we want to share in his glory . Suffering Now and Glory in the Future
NIRV	Romans	8	18	What we are suffering now is nothing compared with our future glory .
NIRV	Romans	8	19	Everything God created looks forward to the future . That will be the time when his children appear in their full and final glory .
NIRV	Romans	8	20	The created world was held back from fulfilling its purpose . But this was not the result of its own choice . It was planned that way by the one who held it back . God planned
NIRV	Romans	8	21	to set the created world free . He didn ’ t want it to rot away . Instead , God wanted it to have the same freedom and glory that his children have .
NIRV	Romans	8	22	We know that all that God created has been groaning . It is in pain as if it were giving birth to a child . The created world continues to groan even now .
NIRV	Romans	8	23	And that ’ s not all . We have the Holy Spirit as the promise of future blessing . But we also groan inside ourselves . We do this as we look forward to the time when God adopts us as full members of his family . Then he will give us everything he has for us . He will raise our bodies and give glory to them .
NIRV	Romans	8	24	That ’ s the hope we had when we were saved . But hope that can be seen is no hope at all . Who hopes for what they already have ?
NIRV	Romans	8	25	We hope for what we don ’ t have yet . So we are patient as we wait for it .
NIRV	Romans	8	26	In the same way , the Holy Spirit helps us when we are weak . We don ’ t know what we should pray for . But the Spirit himself prays for us . He prays through groans too deep for words .
NIRV	Romans	8	27	God , who looks into our hearts , knows the mind of the Spirit . And the Spirit prays for God ’ s people just as God wants him to pray .
NIRV	Romans	8	28	We know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him . He appointed them to be saved in keeping with his purpose .
NIRV	Romans	8	29	God planned that those he had chosen would become like his Son . In that way , Christ will be the first and most honored among many brothers and sisters .
NIRV	Romans	8	30	And those God has planned for , he has also appointed to be saved . Those he has appointed , he has made right with himself . To those he has made right with himself , he has given his glory . We Are More Than Winners
NIRV	Romans	8	31	What should we say then ? Since God is on our side , who can be against us ?
NIRV	Romans	8	32	God did not spare his own Son . He gave him up for us all . Then won ’ t he also freely give us everything else ?
NIRV	Romans	8	33	Who can bring any charge against God ’ s chosen ones ? God makes us right with himself .
NIRV	Romans	8	34	Then who can sentence us to death ? No one . Christ Jesus is at the right hand of God and is also praying for us . He died . More than that , he was raised to life .
NIRV	Romans	8	35	Who can separate us from Christ ’ s love ? Can trouble or hard times or harm or hunger ? Can nakedness or danger or war ?
NIRV	Romans	8	36	It is written , “ Because of you , we face death all day long . We are considered as sheep to be killed. ” ( Psalm 44:22 )
NIRV	Romans	8	37	No ! In all these things we are more than winners ! We owe it all to Christ , who has loved us .
NIRV	Romans	8	38	I am absolutely sure that not even death or life can separate us from God ’ s love . Not even angels or demons , the present or the future , or any powers can separate us .
NIRV	Romans	8	39	Not even the highest places or the lowest , or anything else in all creation can separate us . Nothing at all can ever separate us from God ’ s love . That ’ s because of what Christ Jesus our Lord has done . Copyright ©

NIRV	Romans	9	9	God promised , “ I will return at the appointed time . Sarah will have a son. ” ( Genesis 18:10,14 )
NIRV	Romans	9	2	My heart is full of sorrow . My sadness never ends .
NIRV	Romans	9	3	I am so concerned about my people , who are members of my own race . I am ready to be cursed , if that would help them . I am even willing to be separated from Christ .
NIRV	Romans	9	4	They are the people of Israel . They have been adopted as God ’ s children . God ’ s glory belongs to them . So do the covenants . They received the law . They were taught to worship in the temple . They were given the promises .
NIRV	Romans	9	5	The founders of our nation belong to them . The Messiah comes from their family line . He is God over all . May he always be praised ! Amen . God ’ s Free Choice
NIRV	Romans	9	6	I do not mean that God ’ s word has failed . Not everyone in the family line of Israel really belongs to Israel .
NIRV	Romans	9	7	Not everyone in Abraham ’ s family line is really his child . Not at all ! Scripture says , “ Your family line will continue through Isaac. ” ( Genesis 21:12 )
NIRV	Romans	9	8	In other words , God ’ s children are not just in the family line of Abraham . Instead , they are the children God promised to him . They are the ones considered to be Abraham ’ s children .
NIRV	Romans	9	10	And that ’ s not all . Rebekah ’ s children were born at the same time by the same father . He was our father Isaac .
NIRV	Romans	9	11	Here is what happened . Rebekah ’ s twins had not even been born . They hadn ’ t done anything good or bad yet . So they show that God ’ s purpose is based firmly on his free choice .
NIRV	Romans	9	12	It was not because of anything they did but because of God ’ s choice . So Rebekah was told , “ The older son will serve the younger one. ” ( Genesis 25:23 )
NIRV	Romans	9	13	It is written , “ I chose Jacob instead of Esau. ” ( Malachi 1:2,3 )
NIRV	Romans	9	14	What should we say then ? Is God unfair ? Not at all !
NIRV	Romans	9	15	He said to Moses , “ I will have mercy on whom I have mercy . I will show love to those I love. ” ( Exodus 33:19 )
NIRV	Romans	9	16	So it doesn ’ t depend on what people want or what they do . It depends on God ’ s mercy .
NIRV	Romans	9	17	In Scripture , God says to Pharaoh , “ I had a special reason for making you king . I decided to use you to show my power . I wanted my name to become known everywhere on earth. ” ( Exodus 9:16 )
NIRV	Romans	9	18	So God does what he wants to do . He shows mercy to one person and makes another stubborn .
NIRV	Romans	9	19	One of you will say to me , “ Then why does God still blame us ? Who can oppose what he wants to do ? ”
NIRV	Romans	9	20	But you are a mere human being . So who are you to talk back to God ? Scripture says , “ Can what is made say to the one who made it , ‘ Why did you make me like this ? ’ ” ( Isaiah 29:16 ; 45:9 )
NIRV	Romans	9	21	Isn ’ t the potter free to make different kinds of pots out of the same lump of clay ? Some are for special purposes . Others are for ordinary use .
NIRV	Romans	9	22	What if God chose to show his great anger ? What if he chose to make his power known ? But he put up with the people he was angry with . They were made to be destroyed .
NIRV	Romans	9	23	What if he put up with them to show the riches of his glory to other people ? Those other people are the ones he shows his mercy to . He made them to receive his glory .
NIRV	Romans	9	24	We are those people . He has chosen us . We do not come only from the Jewish race . Many of us are not Jews .
NIRV	Romans	9	25	God says in Hosea , “ I will call those who are not my people ‘ my people. ’ I will call the one who is not my loved one ‘ my loved one. ’ ” ( Hosea 2:23 )
NIRV	Romans	9	26	He also says , “ Once it was said to them , ‘ You are not my people. ’ In that very place they will be called ‘ children of the living God. ’ ” ( Hosea 1:10 )
NIRV	Romans	9	27	Isaiah cries out concerning Israel . He says , “ The number of people from Israel may be like the sand by the sea . But only a few of them will be saved .
NIRV	Romans	9	28	The Lord will carry out his sentence . He will be quick to carry it out on earth , once and for all. ” ( Isaiah 10:22,23 )
NIRV	Romans	9	29	Earlier Isaiah had said , “ The Lord who rules over all left us children and grandchildren . If he hadn ’ t , we would have become like Sodom . We would have been like Gomorrah. ” ( Isaiah 1:9 ) Israel Does Not Believe
NIRV	Romans	9	30	What should we say then ? Gentiles did not look for a way to be right with God . But they found it by having faith .
NIRV	Romans	9	31	The people of Israel tried to obey the law to make themselves right with God . But they didn ’ t reach their goal of being right with God .
NIRV	Romans	9	32	Why not ? Because they tried to do it without faith . They tried to be right with God by what they did . They tripped over the stone that causes people to trip and fall .
NIRV	Romans	9	33	It is written , “ Look ! In Zion I am laying a stone that causes people to trip . It is a rock that makes them fall . The one who believes in him will never be put to shame. ” ( Isaiah 8:14 ; 28:16 ) Copyright ©

NIRV	Romans	10	10	With your heart you believe and are made right with God . With your mouth you say what you believe . And so you are saved .
NIRV	Romans	10	2	I can tell you for certain that they really want to serve God . But how they are trying to do it is not based on knowledge .
NIRV	Romans	10	3	They didn ’ t know that God ’ s power makes people right with himself . They tried to get right with God in their own way . They didn ’ t do it in God ’ s way .
NIRV	Romans	10	4	Christ has fulfilled everything the law was meant to do . So now everyone who believes can be right with God .
NIRV	Romans	10	5	Moses writes about how the law could help a person do what God requires . He writes , “ The person who does these things will live by them. ” ( Leviticus 18:5 )
NIRV	Romans	10	6	But the way to do what God requires must begin by having faith in him . Scripture says , “ Do not say in your heart , ‘ Who will go up into heaven ? ’ ” ( Deuteronomy 30:12 ) That means to go up into heaven and bring Christ down .
NIRV	Romans	10	7	“ And do not say , ‘ Who will go down into the grave ? ’ ” ( Deuteronomy 30:13 ) That means to bring Christ up from the dead .
NIRV	Romans	10	8	But what does it say ? “ The message is near you . It ’ s in your mouth and in your heart. ” ( Deuteronomy 30:14 ) This means the message about faith that we are preaching .
NIRV	Romans	10	9	Say with your mouth , “ Jesus is Lord. ” Believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead . Then you will be saved .
NIRV	Romans	10	11	Scripture says , “ The one who believes in him will never be put to shame. ” ( Isaiah 28:16 )
NIRV	Romans	10	12	There is no difference between those who are Jews and those who are not . The same Lord is Lord of all . He richly blesses everyone who calls on him .
NIRV	Romans	10	13	Scripture says , “ Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. ” ( Joel 2:32 )
NIRV	Romans	10	14	How can they call on him unless they believe in him ? How can they believe in him unless they hear about him ? How can they hear about him unless someone preaches to them ?
NIRV	Romans	10	15	And how can anyone preach without being sent ? It is written , “ How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news ! ” ( Isaiah 52:7 )
NIRV	Romans	10	16	But not all the people of Israel accepted the good news . Isaiah says , “ Lord , who has believed our message ? ” ( Isaiah 53:1 )
NIRV	Romans	10	17	So faith comes from hearing the message . And the message that is heard is the message about Christ .
NIRV	Romans	10	18	But I ask , “ Didn ’ t the people of Israel hear ? ” Of course they did . It is written , “ Their voice has gone out into the whole earth . Their words have gone out from one end of the world to the other. ” ( Psalm 19:4 )
NIRV	Romans	10	19	Again I ask , “ Didn ’ t Israel understand ? ” First , Moses says , “ I will use people who are not a nation to make you jealous . I will use a nation that has no understanding to make you angry. ” ( Deuteronomy 32:21 )
NIRV	Romans	10	20	Then Isaiah boldly speaks about what God says . God said , “ I was found by those who were not trying to find me . I made myself known to those who were not asking for me. ” ( Isaiah 65:1 )
NIRV	Romans	10	21	But Isaiah also speaks about what God says concerning Israel . God said , “ All day long I have held out my hands . I have held them out to a stubborn people who do not obey me. ” ( Isaiah 65:2 ) Copyright ©

NIRV	Romans	11	11	Again , here is what I ask . The Israelites didn ’ t trip and fall once and for all time , did they ? Not at all ! Because Israel sinned , the Gentiles can be saved . That will make Israel jealous of them .
NIRV	Romans	11	2	God didn ’ t turn his back on his people . After all , he chose them . Don ’ t you know what Scripture says about Elijah ? He complained to God about Israel .
NIRV	Romans	11	3	He said , “ Lord , they have killed your prophets . They have torn down your altars . I ’ m the only one left . And they are trying to kill me. ” (
NIRV	Romans	11	1	Kings 19:18 )
NIRV	Romans	11	4	How did God answer him ? God said , “ I have kept 7,000 people for myself . They have not bowed down to Baal. ” (
NIRV	Romans	11	5	Some are also faithful today . They have been chosen by God ’ s grace .
NIRV	Romans	11	6	And if they are chosen by grace , then they can ’ t work for it . If that were true , grace wouldn ’ t be grace anymore .
NIRV	Romans	11	7	What should we say then ? The people of Israel did not receive what they wanted so badly . Those Israelites who were chosen did receive it . But the rest of the people were made stubborn .
NIRV	Romans	11	8	It is written , “ God made it hard for them to understand . He gave them eyes that could not see . He gave them ears that could not hear . And they are still like that today. ” ( Deuteronomy 29:4 ; Isaiah 29:10 )
NIRV	Romans	11	9	David says , “ Let their feast be a trap and a snare . Let them trip and fall . Let them get what ’ s coming to them .
NIRV	Romans	11	10	Let their eyes grow dark so they can ’ t see . Let their backs be bent forever. ” ( Psalm 69:22,23 ) Two Kinds of Olive Branches
NIRV	Romans	11	12	Israel ’ s sin brought riches to the world . Their loss brings riches to the Gentiles . So then what greater riches will come when all Israel turns to God !
NIRV	Romans	11	13	I am talking to you who are not Jews . I am the apostle to the Gentiles . So I take pride in the work I do for God and others .
NIRV	Romans	11	14	I hope somehow to stir up my own people to want what you have . Perhaps I can save some of them .
NIRV	Romans	11	15	When they were not accepted , it became possible for the whole world to be brought back to God . So what will happen when they are accepted ? It will be like life from the dead .
NIRV	Romans	11	16	The first handful of dough that is offered is holy . This makes all of the dough holy . If the root is holy , so are the branches .
NIRV	Romans	11	17	Some of the natural branches have been broken off . You are a wild olive branch . But you have been joined to the tree with the other branches . Now you enjoy the life-giving sap of the olive tree root .
NIRV	Romans	11	18	So don ’ t think you are better than the other branches . Remember , you don ’ t give life to the root . The root gives life to you .
NIRV	Romans	11	19	You will say , “ Some branches were broken off so that I could be joined to the tree. ”
NIRV	Romans	11	20	That ’ s true . But they were broken off because they didn ’ t believe . You stand only because you do believe . So don ’ t be proud , but tremble .
NIRV	Romans	11	21	God didn ’ t spare the natural branches . He won ’ t spare you either .
NIRV	Romans	11	22	Think about how kind God is ! Also think about how firm he is ! He was hard on those who stopped following him . But he is kind to you . So you must continue to live in his kindness . If you don ’ t , you also will be cut off .
NIRV	Romans	11	23	If the people of Israel do not continue in their unbelief , they will again be joined to the tree . God is able to join them to the tree again .
NIRV	Romans	11	24	After all , weren ’ t you cut from a wild olive tree ? Weren ’ t you joined to an olive tree that was taken care of ? And wasn ’ t that the opposite of how things should be done ? How much more easily will the natural branches be joined to their own olive tree ! All Israel Will Be Saved
NIRV	Romans	11	25	Brothers and sisters , here is a mystery I want you to understand . It will keep you from being proud . Part of Israel has refused to obey God . That will continue until the full number of Gentiles has entered God ’ s kingdom .
NIRV	Romans	11	26	In this way all Israel will be saved . It is written , “ The God who saves will come from Mount Zion . He will remove sin from Jacob ’ s family .
NIRV	Romans	11	27	Here is my covenant with them . I will take away their sins. ” ( Isaiah 59:20,21 ; 27:9 ; Jeremiah 31:33,34 )
NIRV	Romans	11	28	As far as the good news is concerned , the people of Israel are enemies . This is for your good . But as far as God ’ s choice is concerned , the people of Israel are loved . This is because of God ’ s promises to the founders of our nation .
NIRV	Romans	11	29	God does not take back his gifts . He does not change his mind about those he has chosen .
NIRV	Romans	11	30	At one time you did not obey God . But now you have received mercy because Israel did not obey .
NIRV	Romans	11	31	In the same way , Israel has not been obeying God . But now they receive mercy because of God ’ s mercy to you .
NIRV	Romans	11	32	God has found everyone guilty of not obeying him . So now he can have mercy on everyone . Praise to God
NIRV	Romans	11	33	How very rich are God ’ s wisdom and knowledge ! How he judges is more than we can understand ! The way he deals with people is more than we can know !
NIRV	Romans	11	34	“ Who can ever know what the Lord is thinking ? Or who can ever give him advice ? ” ( Isaiah 40:13 )
NIRV	Romans	11	35	“ Has anyone ever given anything to God , so that God has to pay them back ? ” ( Job 41:11 )
NIRV	Romans	11	36	All things come from him . All things are directed by him . All things are for his praise . May God be given the glory forever ! Amen . Copyright ©

NIRV	Romans	12	12	When you hope , be joyful . When you suffer , be patient . When you pray , be faithful .
NIRV	Romans	12	2	Don ’ t live the way this world lives . Let your way of thinking be completely changed . Then you will be able to test what God wants for you . And you will agree that what he wants is right . His plan is good and pleasing and perfect . Serving One Another in the Body of Christ
NIRV	Romans	12	3	God ’ s grace has been given to me . So here is what I say to every one of you . Don ’ t think of yourself more highly than you should . Be reasonable when you think about yourself . Keep in mind the faith God has given to each of you .
NIRV	Romans	12	4	Each of us has one body with many parts . And the parts do not all have the same purpose .
NIRV	Romans	12	5	So also we are many persons . But in Christ we are one body . And each part of the body belongs to all the other parts .
NIRV	Romans	12	6	We all have gifts . They differ according to the grace God has given to each of us . Do you have the gift of prophecy ? Then use it according to the faith you have .
NIRV	Romans	12	7	If your gift is serving , then serve . If it is teaching , then teach .
NIRV	Romans	12	8	Is it encouraging others ? Then encourage them . Is it giving to others ? Then give freely . Is it being a leader ? Then work hard at it . Is it showing mercy ? Then do it cheerfully . Love in Action
NIRV	Romans	12	9	Love must be honest and true . Hate what is evil . Hold on to what is good .
NIRV	Romans	12	10	Love one another deeply . Honor others more than yourselves .
NIRV	Romans	12	11	Stay excited about your faith as you serve the Lord .
NIRV	Romans	12	13	Share with the Lord ’ s people who are in need . Welcome others into your homes .
NIRV	Romans	12	14	Bless those who hurt you . Bless them , and do not curse them .
NIRV	Romans	12	15	Be joyful with those who are joyful . Be sad with those who are sad .
NIRV	Romans	12	16	Agree with one another . Don ’ t be proud . Be willing to be a friend of people who aren ’ t considered important . Don ’ t think that you are better than others .
NIRV	Romans	12	17	Don ’ t pay back evil with evil . Be careful to do what everyone thinks is right .
NIRV	Romans	12	18	If possible , live in peace with everyone . Do that as much as you can .
NIRV	Romans	12	19	My dear friends , don ’ t try to get even . Leave room for God to show his anger . It is written , “ I am the God who judges people . I will pay them back , ” ( Deuteronomy 32:35 ) says the Lord .
NIRV	Romans	12	20	Do just the opposite . Scripture says , “ If your enemies are hungry , give them food to eat . If they are thirsty , give them something to drink . By doing those things , you will pile up burning coals on their heads. ” ( Proverbs 25:21,22 )

NIRV	Romans	13	13	Let us act as we should , like people living in the daytime . Have nothing to do with wild parties , and don ’ t get drunk . Don ’ t take part in sexual sins or evil conduct . Don ’ t fight with each other or be jealous of anyone .
NIRV	Romans	13	2	So whoever opposes the authorities opposes leaders whom God has appointed . Those who do that will be judged .
NIRV	Romans	13	3	If you do what is right , you won ’ t need to be afraid of your rulers . But watch out if you do what is wrong ! You don ’ t want to be afraid of those in authority , do you ? Then do what is right , and you will be praised .
NIRV	Romans	13	4	The one in authority serves God for your good . But if you do wrong , watch out ! Rulers don ’ t carry a sword for no reason at all . They serve God . And God is carrying out his anger through them . The ruler punishes anyone who does wrong .
NIRV	Romans	13	5	You must obey the authorities . Then you will not be punished . You must also obey them because you know it is right .
NIRV	Romans	13	6	That ’ s also why you pay taxes . The authorities serve God . Ruling takes up all their time .
NIRV	Romans	13	7	Give to everyone what you owe them . Do you owe taxes ? Then pay them . Do you owe anything else to the government ? Then pay it . Do you owe respect ? Then give it . Do you owe honor ? Then show it . Love Fulfills the Law
NIRV	Romans	13	8	Pay everything you owe . But you can never pay back all the love you owe one another . Whoever loves other people has done everything the law requires .
NIRV	Romans	13	9	Here are some commandments to think about . “ Do not commit adultery. ” “ Do not commit murder. ” “ Do not steal. ” “ Do not want what belongs to others. ” ( Exodus 20:13 15,17 ; Deuteronomy 5:17 19,21 ) These and all other commands are included in one command . Here ’ s what it is . “ Love your neighbor as you love yourself. ” ( Leviticus 19:18 )
NIRV	Romans	13	10	Love does not harm its neighbor . So love does everything the law requires . The Day Is Near
NIRV	Romans	13	11	When you do these things , keep in mind the times we are living in . The hour has already come for you to wake up from your sleep . The full effects of our salvation are closer now than when we first believed in Christ .
NIRV	Romans	13	12	The dark night of evil is nearly over . The day of Christ ’ s return is almost here . So let us get rid of the works of darkness that harm us . Let us do the works of light that protect us .
NIRV	Romans	13	14	Instead , put on the Lord Jesus Christ as if he were your clothing . Don ’ t think about how to satisfy sinful desires . Copyright ©

NIRV	Romans	14	14	I am absolutely sure that nothing is “ unclean ” in itself . The Lord Jesus has convinced me of this . But someone may consider a thing to be “ unclean. ” If they do , it is “ unclean ” for them .
NIRV	Romans	14	2	One person ’ s faith allows them to eat anything . But another person eats only vegetables because their faith is weak .
NIRV	Romans	14	3	The person who eats everything must not look down on the one who does not . And the one who doesn ’ t eat everything must not judge the person who does . That ’ s because God has accepted them .
NIRV	Romans	14	4	Who are you to judge someone else ’ s servant ? Whether they are faithful or not is their own master ’ s concern . And they will be faithful , because the Lord has the power to make them faithful .
NIRV	Romans	14	5	One person considers one day to be more holy than another . Another person thinks all days are the same . Each of them should be absolutely sure in their own mind .
NIRV	Romans	14	6	Whoever thinks that one day is special does so to honor the Lord . Whoever eats meat does so to honor the Lord . They give thanks to God . And whoever doesn ’ t eat meat does so to honor the Lord . They also give thanks to God .
NIRV	Romans	14	7	We don ’ t live for ourselves only . And we don ’ t die for ourselves only .
NIRV	Romans	14	8	If we live , we live to honor the Lord . If we die , we die to honor the Lord . So whether we live or die , we belong to the Lord .
NIRV	Romans	14	9	Christ died and came back to life . He did this to become the Lord of both the dead and the living .
NIRV	Romans	14	10	Now then , who are you to judge your brother or sister ? Why do you act like you ’ re better than they are ? We will all stand in God ’ s courtroom to be judged .
NIRV	Romans	14	11	It is written , “ ‘ You can be sure that I live , ’ says the Lord . ‘ And you can be just as sure that everyone will kneel down in front of me . Every tongue will have to tell the truth about God. ’ ” ( Isaiah 45:23 )
NIRV	Romans	14	12	So we will all have to explain to God the things we have done .
NIRV	Romans	14	13	Let us stop judging one another . Instead , decide not to put anything in the way of a brother or sister . Don ’ t put anything in their way that would make them trip and fall .
NIRV	Romans	14	15	Your brother or sister may be upset by what you eat . If they are , you are no longer acting as though you love them . So don ’ t destroy them by what you eat . Remember that Christ died for them .
NIRV	Romans	14	16	So suppose you know something is good . Then don ’ t let it be spoken of as if it were evil .
NIRV	Romans	14	17	God ’ s kingdom is not about eating or drinking . It is about doing what is right and having peace and joy . All this comes through the Holy Spirit .
NIRV	Romans	14	18	Those who serve Christ in this way are pleasing to God . They are pleasing to people too .
NIRV	Romans	14	19	So let us do all we can to live in peace . And let us work hard to build up one another .
NIRV	Romans	14	20	Don ’ t destroy the work of God because of food . All food is “ clean. ” But it ’ s wrong to eat anything that might cause problems for someone else ’ s faith .
NIRV	Romans	14	21	Don ’ t eat meat if it causes your brother or sister to sin . Don ’ t drink wine or do anything else that will make them sin .
NIRV	Romans	14	22	Whatever you believe about these things , keep between yourself and God . Blessed is the person who doesn ’ t feel guilty for what they do .
NIRV	Romans	14	23	But whoever has doubts about what they eat is guilty if they eat . That ’ s because their eating is not based on faith . Everything that is not based on faith is sin . Copyright ©

NIRV	Romans	15	4	Everything written in the past was written to teach us . The Scriptures give us strength to go on . They encourage us and give us hope .
NIRV	Romans	15	5	Our God is a God who strengthens and encourages you . May he give you the same attitude toward one another that Christ Jesus had .
NIRV	Romans	15	6	Then you can give glory to God with one mind and voice . He is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
NIRV	Romans	15	7	Christ has accepted you . So accept one another in order to bring praise to God .
NIRV	Romans	15	8	I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews . He teaches us that God is true . He shows us that God will keep the promises he made to the founders of our nation .
NIRV	Romans	15	9	Jesus became a servant of the Jews . He did this so that the Gentiles might give glory to God for his mercy . It is written , “ I will praise you among the Gentiles . I will sing the praises of your name. ” (
NIRV	Romans	15	10	Again it says , “ You Gentiles , be full of joy . Be joyful together with God ’ s people. ” ( Deuteronomy 32:43 )
NIRV	Romans	15	11	And again it says , “ All you Gentiles , praise the Lord . Let all the nations sing praises to him. ” ( Psalm 117:1 )
NIRV	Romans	15	12	And Isaiah says , “ The Root of Jesse will grow up quickly . He will rule over the nations . The Gentiles will put their hope in him. ” ( Isaiah 11:10 )
NIRV	Romans	15	13	May the God who gives hope fill you with great joy . May you have perfect peace as you trust in him . May the power of the Holy Spirit fill you with hope . Paul Serves the Gentiles
NIRV	Romans	15	14	My brothers and sisters , I am sure that you are full of goodness . You are filled with knowledge and able to teach one another .
NIRV	Romans	15	16	to serve Christ Jesus among the Gentiles . I have the duty of a priest to preach God ’ s good news . Then the Gentiles will become an offering that pleases God . The Holy Spirit will make the offering holy .
NIRV	Romans	15	17	Because I belong to Christ Jesus , I can take pride in my work for God .
NIRV	Romans	15	18	I will speak about what Christ has done through me . I won ’ t try to speak about anything else . He has been leading the Gentiles to obey God . He has been doing this by what I have said and done .
NIRV	Romans	15	19	He has given me power to do signs and wonders . I can do these things by the power of the Spirit of God . From Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum I have finished preaching . In those places , I preached the good news about Christ .
NIRV	Romans	15	20	I have always wanted to preach the good news where Christ was not known . I don ’ t want to build on what someone else has started .
NIRV	Romans	15	21	It is written , “ Those who were not told about him will understand . Those who have not heard will know what it all means. ” ( Isaiah 52:15 )
NIRV	Romans	15	22	That ’ s why I have often been kept from coming to you . Paul Plans to Visit Rome
NIRV	Romans	15	23	Now there is no more place for me to work in those areas . For many years I have wanted to visit you .
NIRV	Romans	15	24	So I plan to see you when I go to Spain . I hope to visit you while I am passing through . And I hope you will help me on my journey there . But first I want to enjoy being with you for a while .
NIRV	Romans	15	25	Now I am on my way to Jerusalem to serve the Lord ’ s people there .
NIRV	Romans	15	26	The believers in Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to take an offering . It was for those who were poor among the Lord ’ s people in Jerusalem .
NIRV	Romans	15	27	They were happy to do it . And of course they owe it to them . The Gentiles have shared in the Jews ’ spiritual blessings . So the Gentiles should share their earthly blessings with the Jews .
NIRV	Romans	15	28	I want to finish my task . I want to make sure that the poor in Jerusalem have received this offering . Then I will go to Spain . On my way I will visit you .
NIRV	Romans	15	29	I know that when I come to you , I will come with the full blessing of Christ .
NIRV	Romans	15	30	Brothers and sisters , I ask you to join me in my struggle . Join me by praying to God for me . I ask this through the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ . Pray for me with the love the Holy Spirit provides .
NIRV	Romans	15	31	Pray that I will be kept safe from those in Judea who do not believe . I am taking the offering to Jerusalem . Pray that it will be welcomed by the Lord ’ s people there .
NIRV	Romans	15	32	Then I will come to you with joy just as God has planned . We will be renewed by being together .
NIRV	Romans	15	33	May the God who gives peace be with you all . Amen . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	1	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I have been chosen to be an apostle of Christ Jesus just as God planned . Our brother Sosthenes joins me in writing .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	2	We are sending this letter to you , the members of God ’ s church in Corinth . You have been made holy because you belong to Christ Jesus . God has chosen you to be his holy people . He has done the same for all people everywhere who pray to our Lord Jesus Christ . Jesus is their Lord and ours .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	3	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace . Paul Gives Thanks
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I always thank my God for you . I thank him because of the grace he has given to you who belong to Christ Jesus .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	5	You have been blessed in every way because of him . You have been blessed in all your speech and knowledge .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	6	God has shown that what we have spoken to you about Christ is true .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	7	There is no gift of the Holy Spirit that you don ’ t have . You are full of hope as you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to come again .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	8	God will also keep you strong in faith to the very end . Then you will be without blame on the day our Lord Jesus Christ returns .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful . He has chosen you to share life with his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord . Taking Sides in the Church
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	10	Brothers and sisters , I make my appeal to you . I do this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ . I ask that all of you agree with one another in what you say . I ask that you don ’ t take sides . I ask that you are in complete agreement in all that you think .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	11	My brothers and sisters , I have been told you are arguing with one another . Some people from Chloe ’ s house have told me this .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	12	Here is what I mean . One of you says , “ I follow Paul. ” Another says , “ I follow Apollos. ” Another says , “ I follow Peter. ” And still another says , “ I follow Christ. ”
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	13	Does Christ take sides ? Did Paul die on the cross for you ? Were you baptized in the name of Paul ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I thank God that I didn ’ t baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	15	No one can say that you were baptized in my name .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	16	It ’ s true that I also baptized those who live in the house of Stephanas . Besides that , I don ’ t remember if I baptized anyone else .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	17	Christ did not send me to baptize . He sent me to preach the good news . He commanded me not to preach with wisdom and fancy words . That would take all the power away from the cross of Christ . Christ Is God ’ s Power and Wisdom
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	18	The message of the cross seems foolish to those who are lost and dying . But it is God ’ s power to us who are being saved .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	19	It is written , “ I will destroy the wisdom of those who are wise . I will do away with the cleverness of those who think they are so smart. ” ( Isaiah 29:14 )
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise person ? Where is the teacher of the law ? Where are the great thinkers of our time ? Hasn ’ t God made the wisdom of the world foolish ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	21	God wisely planned that the world would not know him through its own wisdom . It pleased God to use the foolish things we preach to save those who believe .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	22	Jews require signs . Greeks look for wisdom .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	23	But we preach about Christ and his death on the cross . That is very hard for Jews to accept . And everyone else thinks it ’ s foolish .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	24	But there are those God has chosen , both Jews and Greeks . To them Christ is God ’ s power and God ’ s wisdom .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	25	The foolish things of God are wiser than human wisdom . The weakness of God is stronger than human strength .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	26	Brothers and sisters , think of what you were when God chose you . Not many of you were considered wise by human standards . Not many of you were powerful . Not many of you belonged to important families .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	27	But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise . God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	28	God chose the things of this world that are common and looked down on . God chose things considered unimportant to do away with things considered important .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	29	So no one can boast to God .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	1	30	Because of what God has done , you belong to Christ Jesus . He has become God ’ s wisdom for us . He makes us right with God . He makes us holy and sets us free .

NIRV	1%20Corinthians	2	1	Corinthians
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	2	2	My goal while I was with you was to talk about only one thing . And that was Jesus Christ and his death on the cross .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	2	3	When I came to you , I was weak and very afraid and trembling all over .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	2	4	I didn ’ t preach my message with clever and compelling words . Instead , my preaching showed the Holy Spirit ’ s power .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	2	5	This was so that your faith would be based on God ’ s power . Your faith would not be based on human wisdom . God ’ s Wisdom Through the Holy Spirit
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	2	6	The words we speak to those who have grown in the faith are wise . Our words are different from the wisdom of this world . Our words are different from those of the rulers of this world . These rulers are becoming less and less powerful .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	2	7	No , we announce God ’ s wisdom . His wisdom is a mystery that has been hidden . But before time began , God planned that his wisdom would bring us heavenly glory .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	2	8	None of the rulers of this world understood God ’ s wisdom . If they had , they would not have nailed the Lord of glory to the cross .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	2	9	It is written that “ no eye has seen , no ear has heard , and no human mind has known. ” ( Isaiah 64:4 ) God has prepared these things for those who love him .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	2	10	God has shown these things to us through his Spirit . The Spirit understands all things . He understands even the deep things of God .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	2	11	Who can know the thoughts of another person ? Only a person ’ s own spirit can know them . In the same way , only the Spirit of God knows God ’ s thoughts .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	2	12	What we have received is not the spirit of the world . We have received the Spirit who is from God . The Spirit helps us understand what God has freely given us .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	2	13	That is what we speak about . We don ’ t use words taught to us by people . We use words taught to us by the Holy Spirit . We use the words taught by the Spirit to explain spiritual truths .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	2	14	The person without the Spirit doesn ’ t accept the things that come from the Spirit of God . These things are foolish to them . They can ’ t understand them . In fact , such things can ’ t be understood without the Spirit ’ s help .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	2	15	The person who has the Spirit can judge all things . But no human being can judge those who have the Spirit . It is written ,
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	2	16	“ Who can ever know what is in the Lord ’ s mind ? Can anyone ever teach him ? ” ( Isaiah 40:13 ) But we have the mind of Christ . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	1	Corinthians
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	3	You are still following the ways of the world . Some of you are jealous . Some of you argue . So aren ’ t you following the ways of the world ? Aren ’ t you acting like ordinary human beings ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	2	The words I spoke to you were like milk , not like solid food . You weren ’ t ready for solid food yet . And you still aren ’ t ready for it .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	4	One of you says , “ I follow Paul. ” Another says , “ I follow Apollos. ” Aren ’ t you acting like ordinary human beings ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	5	After all , what is Apollos ? And what is Paul ? We are only people who serve . We helped you to believe . The Lord has given each of us our own work to do .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	6	I planted the seed . Apollos watered it . But God has been making it grow .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So the one who plants is not important . The one who waters is not important . It is God who makes things grow . He is the important one .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	8	The one who plants and the one who waters have the same purpose . The Lord will give each of them a reward for their work .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	9	We work together to serve God . You are like God ’ s field . You are like his building .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	10	God has given me the grace to lay a foundation as a wise builder . Now someone else is building on it . But each one should build carefully .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	11	No one can lay any other foundation than what has already been laid . That foundation is Jesus Christ .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	12	A person may build on it using gold , silver , jewels , wood , hay or straw .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	13	But each person ’ s work will be shown for what it is . On judgment day it will be brought to light . It will be put through fire . The fire will test how good each person ’ s work is .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If the building doesn ’ t burn up , God will give the builder a reward for the work .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	15	If the building burns up , the builder will lose everything . The builder will be saved , but only like one escaping through the flames .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	16	Don ’ t you know that you yourselves are God ’ s temple ? Don ’ t you know that God ’ s Spirit lives among you ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If anyone destroys God ’ s temple , God will destroy that person . God ’ s temple is holy . And you all together are that temple .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Don ’ t fool yourselves . Suppose some of you think you are wise by the standards of the world . Then you should become “ fools ” so that you can become wise .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	19	The wisdom of this world is foolish in God ’ s eyes . It is written , “ God catches wise people in their own evil plans. ” ( Job 5:13 )
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	20	It is also written , “ The Lord knows that the thoughts of wise people don ’ t amount to anything. ” ( Psalm 94:11 )
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	21	So no more bragging about human leaders ! All things are yours .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	22	That means Paul or Apollos or Peter or the world or life or death or the present or the future . All are yours .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	3	23	You are joined to Christ and belong to him . And Christ is joined to God . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	1	Corinthians
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	4	I don ’ t feel I have done anything wrong . But that doesn ’ t mean I ’ m not guilty . The Lord judges me .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	2	Those who have been given a trust must prove that they are faithful .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	3	I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court . I don ’ t even judge myself .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	5	So don ’ t judge anything before the appointed time . Wait until the Lord returns . He will bring to light what is hidden in the dark . He will show the real reasons why people do what they do . At that time each person will receive their praise from God .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	6	Brothers and sisters , I have used myself and Apollos as examples to help you . You can learn from us the meaning of the saying , “ Don ’ t go beyond what is written. ” Then you won ’ t be proud that you follow one of us instead of the other .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	7	Who makes you different from anyone else ? What do you have that you did not receive ? And if you did receive it , why do you brag as though you did not ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	8	You already have everything you want , don ’ t you ? Have you already become rich ? Have you already begun to rule ? And did you do that without us ? I wish that you really had begun to rule . Then we could also rule with you !
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	9	It seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of a parade . We are like people sentenced to die in front of a crowd . We have been made a show for the whole creation to see . Angels and people are staring at us .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ . But you are so wise in Christ ! We are weak . But you are so strong ! You are honored . But we are looked down on !
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	11	Up to this very hour we are hungry and thirsty . We are dressed in rags . We are being treated badly . We have no homes .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	12	We work hard with our own hands . When others curse us , we bless them . When we are attacked , we put up with it .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	13	When others say bad things about us , we answer with kind words . We have become the world ’ s garbage . We are everybody ’ s trash , right up to this moment . Paul Warns Against Pride
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I am not writing this to shame you . You are my dear children , and I want to warn you .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	15	Suppose you had 10,000 believers in Christ watching over you . You still wouldn ’ t have many fathers . I became your father by serving Christ Jesus and telling you the good news .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	16	So I ’ m asking you to follow my example .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	17	That ’ s the reason I have sent Timothy to you . He is like a son to me , and I love him . He is faithful in serving the Lord . He will remind you of my way of life in serving Christ Jesus . And that agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	18	Some of you have become proud . You act as if I weren ’ t coming to you .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But I will come very soon , if that ’ s what the Lord wants . Then I will find out how those proud people are talking . I will also find out what power they have .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	20	The kingdom of God is not a matter of talk . It is a matter of power .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	4	21	Which do you want ? Should I come to you to correct and punish you ? Or should I come in love and with a gentle spirit ? Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Corinthians	5	5	When you come together like this , hand this man over to Satan . Then the power of sin in his life will be destroyed . His spirit will be saved on the day the Lord returns .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	5	2	And you are proud ! Shouldn ’ t you be very sad instead ? Shouldn ’ t you have thrown out of your church the man doing this ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	5	3	Even though I am not right there with you , I am with you in spirit . And because I am with you in spirit , I have already judged the man doing this . I have judged him in the name of our Lord Jesus .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	5	4	So when you come together , I will be with you in spirit . The power of our Lord Jesus will also be with you .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	5	6	Your bragging is not good . It is like yeast . Don ’ t you know that just a little yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	5	7	Get rid of the old yeast . Then you can be like a new batch of dough without yeast . That is what you really are . That ’ s because Christ , our Passover Lamb , has been offered up for us .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	5	8	So let us keep the Feast , but not with the old bread made with yeast . The yeast I ’ m talking about is hatred and evil . Let us keep the Feast with bread made without yeast . Let us keep it with bread that is honesty and truth .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	5	9	I wrote a letter to you to tell you to stay away from people who commit sexual sins .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	5	10	I didn ’ t mean the people of this world who sin in this way . I didn ’ t mean those who always want more and more . I didn ’ t mean those who cheat or who worship statues of gods . In that case you would have to leave this world !
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	5	11	But here is what I am writing to you now . You must stay away from anyone who claims to be a believer but does evil things . Stay away from anyone who commits sexual sins . Stay away from anyone who always wants more and more things . Stay away from anyone who worships statues of gods . Stay away from anyone who tells lies about others . Stay away from anyone who gets drunk or who cheats . Don ’ t even eat with people like these .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	5	12	Is it my business to judge those outside the church ? Aren ’ t you supposed to judge those inside the church ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	5	13	God will judge those outside . Scripture says , “ Get rid of that evil person ! ” ( Deuteronomy 17:7 ; 19:19 ; 21:21 ; 22:21,24 ; 24:7 ) Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	6	Instead , one believer goes to court against another . And this happens in front of unbelievers !
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	2	Or don ’ t you know that the Lord ’ s people will judge the world ? Since this is true , aren ’ t you able to judge small cases ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	3	Don ’ t you know that we will judge angels ? Then we should be able to judge the things of this life even more !
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	4	So suppose you disagree with one another in matters like this . Who do you ask to decide which of you is right ? Do you ask people who live in a way the church disapproves of ? Of course not !
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	5	I say this to shame you . Is it possible that no one among you is wise enough to judge matters between believers ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	7	When you take another believer to court , you have lost the battle already . Why not be treated wrongly ? Why not be cheated ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	8	Instead , you yourselves cheat and do wrong . And you do it to your brothers and sisters .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	9	Don ’ t you know that people who do wrong will not receive God ’ s kingdom ? Don ’ t be fooled . Those who commit sexual sins will not receive the kingdom . Neither will those who worship statues of gods or commit adultery . Neither will men who sleep with other men .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	10	Neither will thieves or those who always want more and more . Neither will those who are often drunk or tell lies or cheat . People who live like that will not receive God ’ s kingdom .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	11	Some of you used to do those things . But your sins were washed away . You were made holy . You were made right with God . All of this was done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ . It was also done by the Spirit of our God . Sexual Sins
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	12	Some of you say , “ I have the right to do anything. ” But not everything is helpful . Again some of you say , “ I have the right to do anything. ” But I will not be controlled by anything .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	13	Some of you say , “ Food is for the stomach , and the stomach is for food . And God will destroy both of them. ” But the body is not meant for sexual sins . The body is meant for the Lord . And the Lord is meant for the body .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	14	By his power God raised the Lord from the dead . He will also raise us up .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	15	Don ’ t you know that your bodies belong to the body of Christ ? Should I take what belongs to Christ and join it to a prostitute ? Never !
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	16	When you join yourself to a prostitute , you become one with her in body . Don ’ t you know this ? Scripture says , “ The two will become one. ” ( Genesis 2:24 )
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	17	But whoever is joined to the Lord becomes one with him in spirit .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	18	Keep far away from sexual sins . All the other sins a person commits are outside the body . But sexual sins are sins against their own body .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	19	Don ’ t you know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit ? The Spirit is in you , and you have received the Spirit from God . You do not belong to yourselves .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	6	20	Christ has paid the price for you . So use your bodies in a way that honors God . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	1	Corinthians
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	7	I wish all of you were single like me . But you each have your own gift from God . One has this gift , and another has that one .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	2	But since sexual sin is happening , each man should sleep with his own wife . And each woman should sleep with her own husband .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	3	A husband should satisfy his wife ’ s needs . And a wife should satisfy her husband ’ s needs .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	4	The wife ’ s body does not belong only to her . It also belongs to her husband . In the same way , the husband ’ s body does not belong only to him . It also belongs to his wife .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	5	You shouldn ’ t stop giving yourselves to each other . You might possibly do this when you both agree to it . And you should only agree to it to give yourselves time to pray . Then you should come together again . In that way , Satan will not tempt you when you can ’ t control yourselves .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	6	I say those things to you as my advice , not as a command .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	8	I speak now to those who are not married . I also speak to widows . It is good for you to stay single like me .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if you can ’ t control yourselves , you should get married . It is better to get married than to burn with desire .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	10	I give a command to those who are married . It is a direct command from the Lord , not from me . A wife must not leave her husband .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	11	But if she does , she must not get married again . Or she can go back to her husband . And a husband must not divorce his wife .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	12	I also have something to say to everyone else . It is from me , not a direct command from the Lord . Suppose a brother has a wife who is not a believer . If she is willing to live with him , he must not divorce her .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	13	And suppose a woman has a husband who is not a believer . If he is willing to live with her , she must not divorce him .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	14	The unbelieving husband has been made holy through his wife . The unbelieving wife has been made holy through her believing husband . If that were not the case , your children would not be pure and “ clean. ” But as it is , they are holy .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	15	But if the unbeliever leaves , let that person go . In that case , the believer does not have to stay married to the unbeliever . God wants us to live in peace .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	16	Wife , how do you know if you will save your husband ? Husband , how do you know if you will save your wife ? Stay as You Were When God Chose You
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	17	But each believer should live in whatever situation the Lord has given them . Stay as you were when God chose you . That ’ s the rule all the churches must follow .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	18	Was a man already circumcised when God chose him ? Then he should not become uncircumcised . Was he uncircumcised when God chose him ? Then he should not be circumcised .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	19	Being circumcised means nothing . Being uncircumcised means nothing . Doing what God commands is what counts .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Each of you should stay as you were when God chose you .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Were you a slave when God chose you ? Don ’ t let it trouble you . But if you can get your master to set you free , do it .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	22	The person who was a slave when the Lord chose them is now the Lord ’ s free person . The one who was free when God chose them is now a slave of Christ .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	23	Christ has paid the price for you . Don ’ t become slaves of human beings .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	24	Brothers and sisters , each person is accountable to God . So each person should stay as they were when God chose them . Advice for Those Who Are Not Married
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now I want to say something about virgins . I have no direct command from the Lord . But I give my opinion . Because of the Lord ’ s mercy , I give it as one who can be trusted .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	26	Times are hard for you right now . So I think it ’ s good for a man to stay as he is .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Are you engaged to a woman ? Then don ’ t try to get out of it . Are you free from such a promise ? Then don ’ t look for a wife .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But if you do marry someone , you have not sinned . And if a virgin marries someone , she has not sinned . But those who marry someone will have many troubles in this life . I want to save you from this .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	29	Brothers and sisters , what I mean is that the time is short . From now on , those who have a husband or wife should live as if they did not .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	30	Those who mourn should live as if they did not . Those who are happy should live as if they were not . Those who buy something should live as if it were not theirs to keep .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	31	Those who use the things of the world should not become all wrapped up in them . The world as it now exists is passing away .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	32	I don ’ t want you to have anything to worry about . A single man is concerned about the Lord ’ s matters . He wants to know how he can please the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	33	But a married man is concerned about the matters of this world . He wants to know how he can please his wife .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	34	His concerns pull him in two directions . A single woman or a virgin is concerned about the Lord ’ s matters . She wants to serve the Lord with both body and spirit . But a married woman is concerned about the matters of this world . She wants to know how she can please her husband .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	35	I ’ m saying those things for your own good . I ’ m not trying to hold you back . I want you to be free to live in a way that is right . I want you to give yourselves completely to the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	36	Suppose someone is worried that he is not acting with honor toward the virgin he has promised to marry . Suppose his desires are too strong , and he feels that he should marry her . He should do as he wants . He is not sinning . They should get married .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	37	But suppose the man has decided not to marry the virgin . And suppose he has no compelling need to get married and can control himself . If he has made up his mind not to get married , he also does the right thing .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	38	So then , the man who marries the virgin does the right thing . But the man who doesn ’ t marry her does a better thing .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	39	A woman has to stay married to her husband as long as he lives . If he dies , she is free to marry anyone she wants to . But the one she marries must belong to the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	7	40	In my opinion , she is happier if she stays single . And I also think that I am led by the Spirit of God in saying this . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Corinthians	8	1	Corinthians
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	8	8	But food doesn ’ t bring us close to God . We are no worse if we don ’ t eat . We are no better if we do eat .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	8	2	Those who think they know something still don ’ t know as they should .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	8	3	But whoever loves God is known by God .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	8	4	So then , here is what I say about eating food sacrificed to statues of gods . We know that “ a god made by human hands is really nothing at all in the world. ” We know that “ there is only one God. ”
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	8	5	There may be so-called gods either in heaven or on earth . In fact , there are many “ gods ” and many “ lords. ”
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	8	6	But for us there is only one God . He is the Father . All things came from him , and we live for him . And there is only one Lord . He is Jesus Christ . All things came because of him , and we live because of him .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	8	7	But not everyone knows this . Some people still think that statues of gods are real gods . They might eat food sacrificed to statues of gods . When they do , they think of it as food sacrificed to real gods . And because those people have a weak sense of what is right and wrong , they feel guilty .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	8	9	But be careful how you use your rights . Be sure you don ’ t cause someone weaker than you to fall into sin .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	8	10	Suppose you , with all your knowledge , are eating in a temple of one of those gods . And suppose someone who has a weak sense of what is right and wrong sees you . Won ’ t that person become bold and eat what is sacrificed to statues of gods ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	8	11	If so , then your knowledge destroys that weak brother or sister for whom Christ died .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	8	12	Suppose you sin against them in this way . Then you harm their weak sense of what is right and wrong . By doing this , you sin against Christ .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	8	13	So suppose what I eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin . Then what should I do ? I will never eat meat again . In that way , I will not cause them to fall . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	1	Corinthians
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	9	Here is what is written in the Law of Moses . “ Do not stop an ox from eating while it helps separate the grain from the straw. ” ( Deuteronomy 25:4 ) Is it oxen that God is concerned about ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	2	Others may not think of me as an apostle . But I am certainly one to you ! You are the proof that I am the Lord ’ s apostle .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	3	That is what I say to stand up for myself when people judge me .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	4	Don ’ t we have the right to eat and drink ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	5	Don ’ t we have the right to take a believing wife with us when we travel ? The other apostles do . The Lord ’ s brothers do . Peter does .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Or are Barnabas and I the only ones who have to do other work for a living ? Are we the only ones who can ’ t just do the work of apostles all the time ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	7	Who serves as a soldier but doesn ’ t get paid ? Who plants a vineyard but doesn ’ t eat any of its grapes ? Who takes care of a flock but doesn ’ t drink any of the milk ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	8	Do I say this only on human authority ? The Law says the same thing .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	10	Doesn ’ t he say that for us ? Yes , it was written for us . Whoever plows and separates the grain hopes to share the harvest . And it is right for them to hope for this .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	11	We have planted spiritual seed among you . Is it too much to ask that we receive from you some things we need ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	12	Others have the right to receive help from you . Don ’ t we have even more right to do so ? But we didn ’ t use that right . No , we have put up with everything . We didn ’ t want to keep the good news of Christ from spreading .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	13	People who serve in the temple get their food from the temple . Don ’ t you know this ? People who serve at the altar eat from what is offered on the altar . Don ’ t you know this ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	14	So those who preach the good news should also receive their living from their work . That is what the Lord has commanded .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But I haven ’ t used any of those rights . And I ’ m not writing because I hope you will do things like that for me . I would rather die than allow anyone to take away my pride in my work .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	16	But when I preach the good news , I can ’ t brag . I have to preach it . How terrible it will be for me if I do not preach the good news !
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	17	If I preach because I want to , I get a reward . If I preach because I have to , I ’ m only doing my duty .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	18	Then what reward do I get ? Here is what it is . I am able to preach the good news free of charge . And I can do this without using all my rights as a person who preaches the good news . Paul Uses His Freedom to Share the Good News
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	19	I am free and don ’ t belong to anyone . But I have made myself a slave to everyone . I do it to win as many as I can to Christ .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	20	To the Jews I became like a Jew . That was to win the Jews . To those under the law I became like one who was under the law . I did this even though I myself am not under the law . That was to win those under the law .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	21	To those who don ’ t have the law I became like one who doesn ’ t have the law . I did this even though I am not free from God ’ s law . I am under Christ ’ s law . Now I can win those who don ’ t have the law .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	22	To those who are weak I became weak . That was to win the weak . I have become all things to all people . I have done this so that in all possible ways I might save some .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	23	I do all this because of the good news . And I want to share in its blessings . Training to Win the Prize
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	24	In a race all the runners run . But only one gets the prize . You know that , don ’ t you ? So run in a way that will get you the prize .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	25	All who take part in the games train hard . They do it to get a crown that will not last . But we do it to get a crown that will last forever .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	26	So I do not run like someone who doesn ’ t run toward the finish line . I do not fight like a boxer who hits nothing but air .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	9	27	No , I train my body and bring it under control . Then after I have preached to others , I myself will not break the rules . If I did break them , I would fail to win the prize . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	1	Corinthians
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	10	Don ’ t speak against God . That ’ s what some of the people of Israel did . And they were killed by the destroying angel .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	2	They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	3	They all ate the same spiritual food .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	4	They all drank the same spiritual water . They drank from the spiritual rock that went with them . That rock was Christ .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	5	But God was not pleased with most of them . Their bodies were scattered in the desert .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	6	Now those things happened as examples for us . They are supposed to keep us from wanting evil things . The people of Israel wanted these evil things .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	7	So don ’ t worship statues of gods , as some of them did . It is written , “ The people sat down to eat and drink . Then they got up to dance wildly in front of their god. ” ( Exodus 32:6 )
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	8	We should not commit sexual sins , as some of them did . In one day 23,000 of them died .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	9	We should not test the Messiah , as some of them did . They were killed by snakes .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	11	Those things happened to them as examples for us . They were written down to warn us . That ’ s because we are living at the time when God ’ s work is being completed .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	12	So be careful . When you think you are standing firm , you might fall .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	13	You are tempted in the same way all other human beings are . God is faithful . He will not let you be tempted any more than you can take . But when you are tempted , God will give you a way out . Then you will be able to deal with it . Sharing in the Lord ’ s Supper
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	14	My dear friends , run away from statues of gods . Don ’ t worship them .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	15	I ’ m talking to people who are reasonable . Judge for yourselves what I say .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	16	We give thanks for the cup at the Lord ’ s Supper . When we do , aren ’ t we sharing in the blood of Christ ? When we break the bread , aren ’ t we sharing in the body of Christ ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	17	Just as there is one loaf , so we who are many are one body . We all share the one loaf .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	18	Think about the people of Israel . Don ’ t those who eat the offerings share in the altar ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	19	Do I mean that food sacrificed to a statue of a god is anything ? Do I mean that a statue of a god is anything ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	20	No ! But what is sacrificed by those who worship statues of gods is really sacrificed to demons . It is not sacrificed to God . I don ’ t want you to be sharing with demons .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	21	You can ’ t drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too . You can ’ t have a part in both the Lord ’ s table and the table of demons .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	22	Are we trying to make the Lord jealous ? Are we stronger than he is ? The Believer ’ s Freedom
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	23	You say , “ I have the right to do anything. ” But not everything is helpful . Again you say , “ I have the right to do anything. ” But not everything builds us up .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	24	No one should look out for their own interests . Instead , they should look out for the interests of others .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	25	Eat anything sold in the meat market . Don ’ t ask if it ’ s right or wrong .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	26	Scripture says , “ The earth belongs to the Lord . And so does everything in it. ” ( Psalm 24:1 )
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	27	Suppose an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go . Then eat anything that is put in front of you . Don ’ t ask if it ’ s right or wrong .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	28	But suppose someone says to you , “ This food has been sacrificed to a statue of a god. ” Then don ’ t eat it . Keep in mind the good of the person who told you . And don ’ t eat because of a sense of what is right and wrong .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	29	I ’ m talking about the other person ’ s sense of what is right and wrong , not yours . Why is my freedom being judged by what someone else thinks ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	30	Suppose I give thanks when I eat . Then why should I be blamed for eating food I thank God for ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	31	So eat and drink and do everything else for the glory of God .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	32	Don ’ t do anything that causes another person to trip and fall . It doesn ’ t matter if that person is a Jew or a Greek or a member of God ’ s church .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	10	33	Follow my example . I try to please everyone in every way . I ’ m not looking out for what is good for me . I ’ m looking out for the interests of others . I do it so that they might be saved . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	1	Follow my example , just as I follow the example of Christ . Proper Worship
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	11	But here is how things are for those who belong to the Lord . Woman is not independent of man . And man is not independent of woman .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	2	I praise you for being faithful in remembering me . I also praise you for staying true to the teachings of the past . You have stayed true to them , just as I gave them to you .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	3	But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ . The head of the woman is the man . And the head of Christ is God .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	4	Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered brings shame on his head .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	5	But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered brings shame on her head . It is the same as having her head shaved .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	6	What if a woman does not cover her head ? She might as well have her hair cut off . But it is shameful for her to cut her hair or shave her head . So she should cover her head .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	7	A man should not cover his head . He is the likeness and glory of God . But woman is the glory of man .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	8	Man did not come from woman . Woman came from man .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	9	Also , man was not created for woman . Woman was created for man .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	10	That ’ s why a woman should have authority over her own head . She should have this because of the angels .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	12	Woman came from man , and man is born from woman . But everything comes from God .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	13	You be the judge . Is it proper for a woman to pray to God without covering her head ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	14	Suppose a man has long hair . Doesn ’ t the very nature of things teach you that it is shameful ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	15	And suppose a woman has long hair . Doesn ’ t the very nature of things teach you that it is her glory ? Long hair is given to her as a covering .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	16	If anyone wants to argue about this , we don ’ t have any other practice . And God ’ s churches don ’ t either . Celebrating the Lord ’ s Supper in the Right Way
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	17	In the following matters , I don ’ t praise you . Your meetings do more harm than good .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	18	First , here is what people are telling me . When you come together as a church , you take sides . And in some ways I believe it .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	19	Do you really think you need to take sides ? You probably think God favors one side over the other !
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	20	So when you come together , it is not the Lord ’ s Supper you eat .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	21	As you eat , some of you go ahead and eat your own private meals . Because of this , one person stays hungry and another gets drunk .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	22	Don ’ t you have homes to eat and drink in ? You are shaming those in the church who have nothing . Do you think so little of God ’ s church that you do this ? What should I say to you ? Should I praise you ? Certainly not about the Lord ’ s Supper !
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	23	I passed on to you what I received from the Lord . On the night the Lord Jesus was handed over to his enemies , he took bread .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	24	When he had given thanks , he broke it . He said , “ This is my body . It is given for you . Every time you eat it , do it in memory of me. ”
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	25	In the same way , after supper he took the cup . He said , “ This cup is the new covenant in my blood . Every time you drink it , do it in memory of me. ”
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	26	You eat the bread and drink the cup . When you do this , you are announcing the Lord ’ s death until he comes again .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	27	Eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in the right way . Don ’ t do it in a way that isn ’ t worthy of him . If you do , you will be guilty . You ’ ll be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	28	Everyone should take a careful look at themselves before they eat the bread and drink from the cup .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	29	Whoever eats and drinks must recognize the body of Christ . If they don ’ t , judgment will come upon them .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	30	That is why many of you are weak and sick . That is why a number of you have died .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	31	We should think more carefully about what we are doing . Then we would not be found guilty for this .

NIRV	1%20Corinthians	11	33	My brothers and sisters , when you come together to eat , you should all eat together .

NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	1	Corinthians
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	12	There is one body , but it has many parts . But all its many parts make up one body . It is the same with Christ .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	2	You know that at one time you were unbelievers . You were somehow drawn away to worship statues of gods that couldn ’ t even speak .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	3	So I want you to know that no one who is speaking with the help of God ’ s Spirit says , “ May Jesus be cursed. ” And without the help of the Holy Spirit no one can say , “ Jesus is Lord. ”
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	4	There are different kinds of gifts . But they are all given to believers by the same Spirit .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	5	There are different ways to serve . But they all come from the same Lord .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	6	There are different ways the Spirit works . But the same God is working in all these ways and in all people .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	7	The Holy Spirit is given to each of us in a special way . That is for the good of all .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	8	To some people the Spirit gives a message of wisdom . To others the same Spirit gives a message of knowledge .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	9	To others the same Spirit gives faith . To others that one Spirit gives gifts of healing .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	10	To others he gives the power to do miracles . To others he gives the ability to prophesy . To others he gives the ability to tell the spirits apart . To others he gives the ability to speak in different kinds of languages they had not known before . And to still others he gives the ability to explain what was said in those languages .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	11	All the gifts are produced by one and the same Spirit . He gives gifts to each person , just as he decides . One Body but Many Parts
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	13	We were all baptized by one Holy Spirit . And so we are formed into one body . It didn ’ t matter whether we were Jews or Gentiles , slaves or free people . We were all given the same Spirit to drink .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	14	So the body is not made up of just one part . It has many parts .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	15	Suppose the foot says , “ I am not a hand . So I don ’ t belong to the body. ” By saying this , it can not stop being part of the body .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	16	And suppose the ear says , “ I am not an eye . So I don ’ t belong to the body. ” By saying this , it can not stop being part of the body .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye , how could it hear ? If the whole body were an ear , how could it smell ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	18	God has placed each part in the body just as he wanted it to be .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	19	If all the parts were the same , how could there be a body ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	20	As it is , there are many parts . But there is only one body .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	21	The eye can ’ t say to the hand , “ I don ’ t need you ! ” The head can ’ t say to the feet , “ I don ’ t need you ! ”
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	22	In fact , it is just the opposite . The parts of the body that seem to be weaker are the ones we can ’ t do without .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	23	The parts that we think are less important we treat with special honor . The private parts aren ’ t shown . But they are treated with special care .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	24	The parts that can be shown don ’ t need special care . But God has put together all the parts of the body . And he has given more honor to the parts that didn ’ t have any .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	25	In that way , the parts of the body will not take sides . All of them will take care of one another .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	26	If one part suffers , every part suffers with it . If one part is honored , every part shares in its joy .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	27	You are the body of Christ . Each one of you is a part of it .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	28	First , God has placed apostles in the church . Second , he has placed prophets in the church . Third , he has placed teachers in the church . Then he has given to the church miracles and gifts of healing . He also has given the gift of helping others and the gift of guiding the church . God also has given the gift of speaking in different kinds of languages .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	29	Is everyone an apostle ? Is everyone a prophet ? Is everyone a teacher ? Do all work miracles ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	30	Do all have gifts of healing ? Do all speak in languages they had not known before ? Do all explain what is said in those languages ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	12	31	But above all , you should want the more important gifts . Love Is Necessary But now I will show you the best way of all . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Corinthians	13	1	Corinthians
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	13	13	The three most important things to have are faith , hope and love . But the greatest of them is love . Copyright ©
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	13	2	Suppose I have the gift of prophecy . Suppose I can understand all the secret things of God and know everything about him . And suppose I have enough faith to move mountains . If I don ’ t have love , I am nothing at all .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	13	3	Suppose I give everything I have to poor people . And suppose I give myself over to a difficult life so I can brag . If I don ’ t have love , I get nothing at all .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	13	4	Love is patient . Love is kind . It does not want what belongs to others . It does not brag . It is not proud .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	13	5	It does not dishonor other people . It does not look out for its own interests . It does not easily become angry . It does not keep track of other people ’ s wrongs .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	13	6	Love is not happy with evil . But it is full of joy when the truth is spoken .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	13	7	It always protects . It always trusts . It always hopes . It never gives up .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	13	8	Love never fails . But prophecy will pass away . Speaking in languages that had not been known before will end . And knowledge will pass away .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	13	9	What we know now is not complete . What we prophesy now is not perfect .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	13	10	But when what is complete comes , the things that are not complete will pass away .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I talked like a child . I thought like a child . I had the understanding of a child . When I became a man , I put the ways of childhood behind me .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	13	12	Now we see only a dim likeness of things . It is as if we were seeing them in a foggy mirror . But someday we will see clearly . We will see face to face . What I know now is not complete . But someday I will know completely , just as God knows me completely .

NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	1	Corinthians
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	14	If I pray in another language , my spirit prays . But my mind does not pray .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	2	Anyone who speaks in a language they had not known before doesn ’ t speak to people . They speak only to God . In fact , no one understands them . What they say by the Spirit remains a mystery .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But the person who prophesies speaks to people . That person prophesies to make people stronger , to give them hope , and to comfort them .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	4	Anyone who speaks in other languages builds up only themselves . But the person who prophesies builds up the church .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	5	I would like all of you to speak in other languages . But I would rather have you prophesy . The person who prophesies is more helpful than those who speak in other languages . But that is not the case if someone explains what was said in the other languages . Then the whole church can be built up .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	6	Brothers and sisters , suppose I were to come to you and speak in other languages . What good would I be to you ? None ! I would need to come with new truth or knowledge . Or I would need to come with a prophecy or a teaching .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	7	Here are some examples . Certain objects make sounds . Take a flute or a harp . No one will know what the tune is unless different notes are played .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	8	Also , if the trumpet call isn ’ t clear , who will get ready for battle ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	9	It ’ s the same with you . You must speak words that people understand . If you don ’ t , no one will know what you are saying . You will just be speaking into the air .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	10	It is true that there are all kinds of languages in the world . And they all have meaning .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	11	But if I don ’ t understand what someone is saying , I am a stranger to the person speaking . And that person is a stranger to me .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	12	It ’ s the same with you . You want the gifts of the Spirit . So try to do your best in using gifts that build up the church .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	13	So here is what the person who speaks in languages they had not known before should do . They should pray that they can explain what they say .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	15	So what should I do ? I will pray with my spirit . But I will also pray with my understanding . I will sing with my spirit . But I will also sing with my understanding .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	16	Suppose you are praising God in the Spirit . And suppose there are visitors among you who want to know what ’ s going on . How can they say “ Amen ” when you give thanks ? They don ’ t know what you are saying .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	17	You are certainly giving thanks . But no one else is being built up .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I thank God that I speak in other languages more than all of you do .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	19	In the church , I wouldn ’ t want to speak 10,000 words in an unfamiliar language . I ’ d rather speak five words in a language people could understand . Then I would be teaching others .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	20	Brothers and sisters , stop thinking like children . Be like babies as far as evil is concerned . But be grown up in your thinking .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	21	In the law it is written , “ With unfamiliar languages and through the lips of outsiders I will speak to these people . But even then they will not listen to me. ” ( Isaiah 28:11,12 ) That is what the Lord says .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	22	So speaking in other languages is a sign for those who don ’ t believe . It is not a sign for those who do believe . But prophecy is not for those who don ’ t believe . It is for those who believe .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	23	Suppose the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in other languages . And suppose visitors or unbelievers come in . Won ’ t they say you are out of your minds ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But suppose unbelievers or visitors come in while everyone is prophesying . Then they will feel guilty about their sin . They will be judged by all .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	25	The secrets of their hearts will be brought out into the open . They will fall down and worship God . They will exclaim , “ God is really here among you ! ” Proper Worship
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	26	Brothers and sisters , what should we say then ? When you come together , each of you brings something . You bring a hymn or a teaching or a message from God . You bring a message in another language or explain what was said in that language . Everything must be done to build up the church .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	27	No more than two or three people should speak in another language . And they should speak one at a time . Then someone must explain what was said .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	28	If there is no one to explain , the person speaking should keep quiet in the church . They can speak to themselves and to God .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	29	Only two or three prophets are supposed to speak . Others should decide if what is being said is true .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	30	What if a message from God comes to someone else who is sitting there ? Then the one who is speaking should stop .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	31	Those who prophesy can all take turns . In that way , everyone can be taught and be given hope .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	32	Those who prophesy should control their speaking .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	33	God is not a God of disorder . He is a God of peace , just as in all the churches of the Lord ’ s people .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	34	Women should remain silent in church meetings . They are not allowed to speak . They must follow the lead of those who are in authority , as the law says .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	35	If they have a question about something , they should ask their own husbands at home . It is shameful for women to speak in church meetings .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	36	Or did the word of God begin with you ? Or are you the only people it has reached ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	37	Suppose anyone thinks they are a prophet . Or suppose they think they have other gifts given by the Holy Spirit . They should agree that what I am writing to you is the Lord ’ s command .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	38	But anyone who does not recognize this will not be recognized .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	39	Brothers and sisters , you should want to prophesy . And don ’ t stop people from speaking in languages they had not known before .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	14	40	But everything should be done in a proper and orderly way . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	1	Corinthians
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	15	More than that , we would be lying about God . We are witnesses that God raised Christ from the dead . But he did not raise him if the dead are not raised .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	2	Because you believed the good news , you are saved . But you must hold firmly to the message I preached to you . If you don ’ t , you have believed it for nothing .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	3	What I received I passed on to you . And it is the most important of all . Here is what it is . Christ died for our sins , just as Scripture said he would .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	4	He was buried . He was raised from the dead on the third day , just as Scripture said he would be .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	5	He appeared to Peter . Then he appeared to the
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	12	We have preached that Christ has been raised from the dead . So how can some of you say that no one rises from the dead ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	6	After that , he appeared to more than
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	500	brothers and sisters at the same time . Most of them are still living . But some have died .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	7	He appeared to James . Then he appeared to all the apostles .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	8	Last of all , he also appeared to me . I was like someone who wasn ’ t born at the right time .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	9	I am the least important of the apostles . I ’ m not even fit to be called an apostle . I tried to destroy God ’ s church .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But because of God ’ s grace I am what I am . And his grace was not wasted on me . No , I have worked harder than all the other apostles . But I didn ’ t do the work . God ’ s grace was with me .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	11	So this is what we preach , whether I or the other apostles who preached to you . And that is what you believed . Believers Will Rise From the Dead
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	13	If no one rises from the dead , then not even Christ has been raised .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ has not been raised , what we preach doesn ’ t mean anything . Your faith doesn ’ t mean anything either .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	16	If the dead are not raised , then Christ has not been raised either .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	17	And if Christ has not been raised , your faith doesn ’ t mean anything . Your sins have not been forgiven .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	18	Those who have died believing in Christ are also lost .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	19	Do we have hope in Christ only for this life ? Then people should pity us more than anyone else .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But Christ really has been raised from the dead . He is the first of all those who will rise from the dead .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	21	Death came because of what a man did . Rising from the dead also comes because of what a man did .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	22	Because of Adam , all people die . So because of Christ , all will be made alive .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	23	But here is the order of events . Christ is the first of those who rise from the dead . When he comes back , those who belong to him will be raised .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	24	Then the end will come after Christ destroys all rule , authority and power . Then he will hand over the kingdom to God the Father .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	25	Christ must rule until he has put all his enemies under his control .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy that will be destroyed is death .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	27	Scripture says that God “ has put everything under his control. ” ( Psalm 8:6 ) It says that “ everything ” has been put under him . But it is clear that this does not include God himself . That ’ s because God put everything under Christ .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	28	When he has done that , the Son also will be under God ’ s rule . God put everything under the Son . In that way , God will be all in all .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Suppose no one rises from the dead . Then what will people do who are baptized for the dead ? Suppose the dead are not raised at all . Then why are people baptized for them ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	30	And why would we put ourselves in danger every hour ?
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	31	I face death every day . That ’ s the truth . And here is something you can be just as sure of . I take pride in what Christ Jesus our Lord has done for you through my work .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	32	Did I fight wild animals in Ephesus with nothing more than human hopes ? Then what have I gotten for it ? If the dead are not raised , “ Let us eat and drink , because tomorrow we will die. ” ( Isaiah 22:13 )
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Don ’ t let anyone fool you . “ Bad companions make a good person bad. ”
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	34	You should come back to your senses and stop sinning . Some of you don ’ t know anything about God . I say this to make you ashamed . The Body That Rises From the Dead
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But someone will ask , “ How are the dead raised ? What kind of body will they have ? ”
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	36	How foolish ! What you plant doesn ’ t come to life unless it dies .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	37	When you plant something , it isn ’ t a completely grown plant that you put in the ground . You only plant a seed . Maybe it ’ s wheat or something else .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	38	But God gives the seed a body just as he has planned . And to each kind of seed he gives its own body .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	39	Not all earthly creatures are the same . People have one kind of body . Animals have another . Birds have another kind . Fish have still another .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	40	There are also heavenly bodies as well as earthly bodies . Heavenly bodies have one kind of glory . Earthly bodies have another .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	41	The sun has one kind of glory . The moon has another kind . The stars have still another . And one star ’ s glory is different from that of another star .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	42	It will be like that with bodies that are raised from the dead . The body that is planted does not last forever . The body that is raised from the dead lasts forever .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	43	It is planted without honor . But it is raised in glory . It is planted in weakness . But it is raised in power .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	44	It is planted as an earthly body . But it is raised as a spiritual body . Just as there is an earthly body , there is also a spiritual body .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	45	It is written , “ The first man Adam became a living person. ” ( Genesis 2:7 ) The last Adam became a spirit that gives life .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	46	What is spiritual did not come first . What is earthly came first . What is spiritual came after that .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man came from the dust of the earth . The second man came from heaven .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	48	Those who belong to the earth are like the one who came from the earth . And those who are spiritual are like the heavenly man .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	49	We are like the earthly man . And we will be like the heavenly man .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	50	Brothers and sisters , here is what I ’ m telling you . Bodies made of flesh and blood can ’ t share in the kingdom of God . And what dies can ’ t share in what never dies .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	51	Listen ! I am telling you a mystery . We will not all die . But we will all be changed .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	52	That will happen in a flash , as quickly as you can wink an eye . It will happen at the blast of the last trumpet . Then the dead will be raised to live forever . And we will be changed .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	53	Our natural bodies don ’ t last forever . They must be dressed with what does last forever . What dies must be dressed with what does not die .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	54	In fact , that is going to happen . What does not last will be dressed with what lasts forever . What dies will be dressed with what does not die . Then what is written will come true . It says , “ Death has been swallowed up . It has lost the battle. ” ( Isaiah 25:8 )
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	55	“ Death , where is the victory you thought you had ? Death , where is your sting ? ” ( Hosea 13:14 )
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	56	The sting of death is sin . And the power of sin is the law .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	57	But let us give thanks to God ! He gives us the victory because of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	15	58	My dear brothers and sisters , remain strong in the faith . Don ’ t let anything move you . Always give yourselves completely to the work of the Lord . Because you belong to the Lord , you know that your work is not worthless . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Corinthians	16	5	After I go through Macedonia , I will come to you . I will only be passing through Macedonia .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	16	6	But I might stay with you for a while . I might even spend the winter . Then you can help me on my journey everywhere I go .

NIRV	1%20Corinthians	16	14	Be loving in everything you do .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	16	15	You know that the first believers in Achaia were from the family of Stephanas . They have spent all their time serving the Lord ’ s people . Brothers and sisters , I am asking you
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	16	17	I was glad when Stephanas , Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived . They have supplied me with what you couldn ’ t give me .
NIRV	1%20Corinthians	16	18	They renewed my spirit , and yours also . People like them are worthy of honor . Final Greetings

NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	2	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace . Praise to the God Who Gives Comfort
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	1	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I am an apostle of Christ Jesus just as God planned . Timothy our brother joins me in writing . We are sending this letter to you , the members of God ’ s church in Corinth . It is also for all God ’ s holy people everywhere in Achaia .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	3	Give praise to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! He is the Father who gives tender love . All comfort comes from him .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	4	He comforts us in all our troubles . Now we can comfort others when they are in trouble . We ourselves receive comfort from God .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	5	We share very much in the sufferings of Christ . So we also share very much in his comfort .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	6	If we are having trouble , it is so that you will be comforted and renewed . If we are comforted , it is so that you will be comforted . Then you will be able to put up with the same suffering we have gone through .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	7	Our hope for you remains firm . We know that you suffer just as we do . In the same way , God comforts you just as he comforts us .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	8	Brothers and sisters , we want you to know about the hard times we had in Asia Minor . We were having a lot of trouble . It was far more than we could stand . We even thought we were going to die .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	9	In fact , we felt as if we were under the sentence of death . But that happened so that we would not depend on ourselves but on God . He raises the dead to life .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	10	God has saved us from deadly dangers . And he will continue to do it . We have put our hope in him . He will continue to save us .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	11	You must help us by praying for us . Then many people will give thanks because of what will happen to us . They will thank God for his kindness to us in answer to the prayers of many . Paul Changes His Plans
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	12	Here is what we take pride in . Our sense of what is right and wrong tells us how we have acted . We have lived with honor and godly honesty . We have depended on God ’ s grace and not on the world ’ s wisdom . We lived that way most of all when we were dealing with you .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	13	We are writing only what you can read and understand . And here is what I hope .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	14	Up to this point you have understood some of the things we have said . But now here is what I hope for when the Lord Jesus returns . I hope that your pride in us will be the same as our pride in you . When this happens , you will understand us completely .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	15	Because I was sure of this , I wanted to visit you first . Here is how I thought you would be helped twice .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	16	I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia . I would have come back to you from there . Then you would have sent me on my way to Judea .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	17	When I planned all this , was I ready to change my mind for no good reason ? No . I don ’ t make my plans the way the world makes theirs . In the same breath the world says both , “ Yes ! Yes ! ” and “ No ! No ! ”
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	18	But just as sure as God is faithful , our message to you is not “ Yes ” and “ No. ”
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	19	Silas , Timothy and I preached to you about the Son of God , Jesus Christ . Our message did not say “ Yes ” and “ No ” at the same time . The message of Christ has always been “ Yes. ”
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	20	God has made a great many promises . They are all “ Yes ” because of what Christ has done . So through Christ we say “ Amen. ” We want God to receive glory .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	21	He makes both us and you remain strong in the faith because we belong to Christ . He anointed us .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	22	He put his Spirit in our hearts and marked us as his own . We can now be sure that he will give us everything he promised us .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	23	I call God to be my witness . May he take my life if I ’ m lying . I wanted to spare you , so I didn ’ t return to Corinth .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	1	24	Your faith is not under our control . You remain strong in your own faith . But we work together with you for your joy . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Corinthians	2	2	If I make you sad , who is going to make me glad ? Only you , the people I made sad .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	2	1	So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	2	3	What I wrote to you I wrote for a special reason . When I came , I didn ’ t want to be troubled by those who should make me glad . I was sure that all of you would share my joy .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	2	4	I was very troubled when I wrote to you . My heart was sad . My eyes were full of tears . I didn ’ t want to make you sad . I wanted to let you know that I love you very deeply . Forgive Those Who Make You Sad
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	2	5	Suppose someone has made us sad . In some ways , he hasn ’ t made me sad so much as he has made all of you sad . But I don ’ t want to put this too strongly .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	2	6	He has been punished because most of you decided he should be . This punishment is enough .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	2	7	Now you should forgive him and comfort him . Then he won ’ t be sad more than he can stand .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	2	8	So I ’ m asking you to tell him again that you still love him .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	2	9	I wrote to you for another special reason . I wanted to see if you could stand the test . I wanted to see if you could obey everything asked of you .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	2	10	Anyone you forgive I also forgive . Was there anything to forgive ? If so , I have forgiven it for your benefit , knowing that Christ is watching .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	2	11	We don ’ t want Satan to outsmart us . We know how he does his evil work . Serving Under the New Covenant
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	2	12	I went to Troas to preach the good news about Christ . There I found that the Lord had opened a door of opportunity for me .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	2	13	But I still had no peace of mind . I couldn ’ t find my brother Titus there . So I said goodbye to the believers at Troas and went on to Macedonia .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	2	14	Give thanks to God ! He always leads us as if we were prisoners in Christ ’ s victory parade . Through us , God spreads the knowledge of Christ everywhere like perfume .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	2	15	God considers us to be the pleasing smell that Christ is spreading . He is spreading it among people who are being saved and people who are dying .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	2	16	To those who are dying , we are the smell of death . To those who are being saved , we are the perfume of life . Who is able to do this work ?
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	2	17	Unlike many people , we aren ’ t selling God ’ s word to make money . In fact , it is just the opposite . Because of Christ we speak honestly before God . We speak like people God has sent . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Corinthians	3	2	You yourselves are our letter . You are written on our hearts . Everyone knows you and reads you .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	3	3	You make it clear that you are a letter from Christ . You are the result of our work for God . You are a letter written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God . You are a letter written not on tablets made out of stone but on human hearts .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	3	4	Through Christ , we can be sure of this before God .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	3	5	In ourselves we are not able to claim anything for ourselves . The power to do what we do comes from God .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	3	6	He has given us the power to serve under a new covenant . The covenant is not based on the written Law of Moses . It comes from the Holy Spirit . The written Law kills , but the Spirit gives life . The Greater Glory of the New Covenant
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	3	7	The Law was written in letters on stone . Even though it was a way of serving God , it led to death . But even that way of serving God came with glory . The glory lasted for only a short time . Even so , the people of Israel couldn ’ t look at Moses ’ face very long .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	3	8	Since all this is true , won ’ t the work of the Holy Spirit be even more glorious ?
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	3	9	The law that condemns people to death had glory . How much more glory does the work of the Spirit have ! His work makes people right with God .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	3	10	The glory of the old covenant is nothing compared with the far greater glory of the new .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	3	11	The glory of the old lasts for only a short time . How much greater is the glory of the new ! It will last forever .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	3	12	Since we have that kind of hope , we are very bold .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	3	13	We are not like Moses . He used to cover his face with a veil . That was to keep the people of Israel from seeing the end of what was passing away .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were made stubborn . To this day , the same veil remains when the old covenant is read . The veil has not been removed . Only faith in Christ can take it away .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	3	15	To this day , when the Law of Moses is read , a veil covers the minds of those who hear it .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	3	16	But when anyone turns to the Lord , the veil is taken away .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is the Holy Spirit . And where the Spirit of the Lord is , freedom is also there .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	3	18	None of our faces are covered with a veil . All of us can see the Lord ’ s glory and think deeply about it . So we are being changed to become more like him so that we have more and more glory . And this glory comes from the Lord , who is the Holy Spirit . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Corinthians	4	2	Instead , we have given up doing secret and shameful things . We don ’ t twist God ’ s word . In fact , we do just the opposite . We present the truth plainly . In the sight of God , we make our appeal to everyone ’ s sense of what is right and wrong .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	4	4	The god of this world has blinded the minds of those who don ’ t believe . They can ’ t see the light of the good news that makes Christ ’ s glory clear . Christ is the likeness of God .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	4	3	Suppose our good news is covered with a veil . Then it is veiled to those who are dying .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	4	5	The message we preach is not about ourselves . Our message is about Jesus Christ . We say that he is Lord . And we say that we serve you because of Jesus .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	4	6	God said , “ Let light shine out of darkness. ” ( Genesis 1:3 ) He made his light shine in our hearts . His light gives us the light to know God ’ s glory . His glory is shown in the face of Christ .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	4	7	Treasure is kept in clay jars . In the same way , we have the treasure of the good news in these earthly bodies of ours . That shows that the mighty power of the good news comes from God . It doesn ’ t come from us .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	4	8	We are pushed hard from all sides . But we are not beaten down . We are bewildered . But that doesn ’ t make us lose hope .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	4	9	Others make us suffer . But God does not desert us . We are knocked down . But we are not knocked out .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	4	10	We always carry around the death of Jesus in our bodies . In that way , the life of Jesus can be shown in our bodies .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	4	11	We who are alive are always in danger of death because we are serving Jesus . This happens so that his life can also be shown in our earthly bodies .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	4	12	Death is at work in us . But life is at work in you .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	4	13	It is written , “ I believed , and so I have spoken. ” ( Psalm 116:10 ) We have that same spirit of faith . So we also believe and speak .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	4	14	We know that God raised the Lord Jesus from the dead . And he will also raise us up with Jesus . And he will present both you and us to himself .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	4	15	All this is for your benefit . God ’ s grace is reaching more and more people . So they will become more and more thankful . They will give glory to God .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	4	16	We don ’ t give up . Our bodies are becoming weaker and weaker . But our spirits are being renewed day by day .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	4	17	Our troubles are small . They last only for a short time . But they are earning for us a glory that will last forever . It is greater than all our troubles .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	4	18	So we don ’ t spend all our time looking at what we can see . Instead , we look at what we can ’ t see . That ’ s because what can be seen lasts only a short time . But what can ’ t be seen will last forever . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	2	During our time on earth we groan . We long to put on our house in heaven as if it were clothing .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	5	God has formed us for that very purpose . He has given us the Holy Spirit as a down payment . The Spirit makes us sure of what is still to come .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	3	Then we will not be naked .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	4	While we live in this tent of ours , we groan under our heavy load . We don ’ t want to be naked . Instead , we want to be fully dressed with our house in heaven . What must die will be swallowed up by life .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	6	So here is what we can always be certain about . As long as we are at home in our bodies , we are away from the Lord .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	7	We live by believing , not by seeing .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	8	We are certain about that . We would rather be away from our bodies and at home with the Lord .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	9	So we try our best to please him . We want to please him whether we are at home in our bodies or away from them .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	10	We must all stand in front of Christ to be judged . Each one of us will be judged for what we do while in our bodies . We ’ ll be judged for the good things and the bad things . Then each of us will receive what we are supposed to get . Christ Brings Us Back to God
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	11	We know what it means to have respect for the Lord . So we try to help other people to understand it . What we are is plain to God . I hope it is also plain to your way of thinking .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	12	We are not trying to make an appeal to you again . But we are giving you a chance to take pride in us . Some people take pride in their looks rather than what ’ s in their hearts . If you take pride in us , you will be able to answer them .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	13	Are we “ out of our minds , ” as some people say ? If so , it is because we want to serve God . Does what we say make sense ? If so , it is because we want to serve you .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	14	Christ ’ s love controls us . We are sure that one person died for everyone . And so everyone died .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	15	Christ died for everyone . He died so that those who live should not live for themselves anymore . They should live for Christ . He died for them and was raised again .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	16	So from now on we don ’ t look at anyone the way the world does . At one time we looked at Christ in that way . But we don ’ t anymore .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	17	When anyone lives in Christ , the new creation has come . The old is gone ! The new is here !
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	18	All this is from God . He brought us back to himself through Christ ’ s death on the cross . And he has given us the task of bringing others back to him through Christ .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	19	God was bringing the world back to himself through Christ . He did not hold people ’ s sins against them . God has trusted us with the message that people may be brought back to him .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	20	So we are Christ ’ s official messengers . It is as if God were making his appeal through us . Here is what Christ wants us to beg you to do . Come back to God !
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	5	21	Christ didn ’ t have any sin . But God made him become sin for us . So we can be made right with God because of what Christ has done for us . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Corinthians	6	6	We remain pure . We understand completely what it means to serve God . We are patient and kind . We serve him in the power of the Holy Spirit . We serve him with true love .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	6	3	We don ’ t put anything in anyone ’ s way . So no one can find fault with our work for God .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	6	4	Instead , we make it clear that we serve God in every way . We serve him by standing firm in troubles , hard times and suffering .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	6	5	We don ’ t give up when we are beaten or put in prison . When people stir up trouble in the streets , we continue to serve God . We work hard for him . We go without sleep and food .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	6	7	We speak the truth . We serve in the power of God . We hold the weapons of godliness in the right hand and in the left .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	6	8	We serve God in times of glory and shame . We serve him whether the news about us is bad or good . We are true to our calling . But people treat us as if we were pretenders .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	6	9	We are known , but people treat us as if we were unknown . We are dying , but we continue to live . We are beaten , but we are not killed .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	6	10	We are sad , but we are always full of joy . We are poor , but we make many people rich . We have nothing , but we own everything .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	6	11	Believers at Corinth , we have spoken freely to you . We have opened our hearts wide to you .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	6	12	We are not holding back our love from you . But you are holding back your love from us .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	6	13	I speak to you as if you were my children . It is only fair that you open your hearts wide to us also . Paul Warns Against Worshiping False Gods
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	6	14	Do not be joined to unbelievers . What do right and wrong have in common ? Can light and darkness be friends ?
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	6	15	How can Christ and Satan agree ? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever ?
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	6	16	How can the temple of the true God and the statues of other gods agree ? We are the temple of the living God . God has said , “ I will live with them . I will walk among them . I will be their God . And they will be my people. ” ( Leviticus 26:12 ; Jeremiah 32:38 ; Ezekiel 37:27 )
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	6	17	So , “ Come out from among them and be separate , says the Lord . Do not touch anything that is not pure and ‘ clean. ’ Then I will receive you. ” ( Isaiah 52:11 ; Ezekiel 20:34,41 )

NIRV	2%20Corinthians	7	2	Make room for us in your hearts . We haven ’ t done anything wrong to anyone . We haven ’ t caused anyone to sin . We haven ’ t taken advantage of anyone .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	7	7	We were comforted not only when he came but also by the comfort you had given him . He told us how much you longed for me . He told us about your deep sadness and concern for me . That made my joy greater than ever .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I don ’ t say this to judge you . I have told you before that you have an important place in our hearts . We would live or die with you .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	7	4	I have spoken to you very honestly . I am very proud of you . I am very happy . Even with all our troubles , my joy has no limit .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	7	5	When we came to Macedonia , we weren ’ t able to rest . We were attacked no matter where we went . We had battles on the outside and fears on the inside .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	7	6	But God comforts those who are sad . He comforted us when Titus came .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	7	8	Even if my letter made you sad , I ’ m not sorry I sent it . At first I was sorry . I see that my letter hurt you , but only for a little while .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	7	9	Now I am happy . I ’ m not happy because you were made sad . I ’ m happy because your sadness led you to turn away from your sins . You became sad just as God wanted you to . So you were not hurt in any way by us .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	7	10	Godly sadness causes us to turn away from our sins and be saved . And we are certainly not sorry about that ! But worldly sadness brings death .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	7	11	Look at what that godly sadness has produced in you . You are working hard to clear yourselves . You are angry and alarmed . You are longing to see me . You are concerned . You are ready to make sure that the right thing is done . In every way you have proved that you are not guilty in that matter .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	7	12	So even though I wrote to you , it wasn ’ t because of the one who did the wrong . It wasn ’ t because of the one who was hurt either . Instead , I wrote you so that in the sight of God you could see for yourselves how faithful you are to us .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	7	13	All this encourages us . We were also very glad to see how happy Titus was . You have all renewed his spirit .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	7	14	I had bragged about you to him . And you have not let me down . Everything we said to you was true . In the same way , our bragging about you to Titus has also turned out to be true .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	7	15	His love for you is even greater when he remembers that you all obeyed his teaching . You received him with fear and trembling .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I am glad I can have complete faith in you . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	2	They have suffered a great deal . But in their suffering , their joy was more than full . Even though they were very poor , they gave very freely .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	8	I am not commanding you to do it . But I want to test you . I want to find out if you really love God . I want to compare your love with that of others .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	3	I tell you that they gave as much as they could . In fact , they gave even more than they could . Completely on their own ,
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	4	they begged us for the chance to share in serving the Lord ’ s people in that way .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	5	They did more than we expected . First they gave themselves to the Lord . Then they gave themselves to us because that was what God wanted .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	6	Titus had already started collecting money from you . So we asked him to help you finish making your kind gift .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	7	You do well in everything else . You do well in faith and in speaking . You do well in knowledge and in complete commitment . And you do well in the love we have helped to start in you . So make sure that you also do well in the grace of giving to others .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	9	You know the grace shown by our Lord Jesus Christ . Even though he was rich , he became poor to help you . Because he became poor , you can become rich .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	10	Here is my opinion about what is best for you in that matter . Last year you were the first to give . You were also the first to want to give .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	11	So finish the work . Then your desire to do it will be matched by your finishing it . Give on the basis of what you have .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	12	Do you really want to give ? Then the gift is measured by what someone has . It is not measured by what they don ’ t have .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	13	We don ’ t want others to have it easy at your expense . We want things to be equal .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	14	Right now you have plenty in order to take care of what they need . Then they will have plenty to take care of what you need . The goal is to even things out .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	15	It is written , “ The one who gathered a lot didn ’ t have too much . And the one who gathered a little had enough. ” ( Exodus 16:18 ) Paul Sends Titus to Corinth to Receive the Offering
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	16	God put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you . Thanks should be given to God for this .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	17	Titus welcomed our appeal . He is also excited about coming to you . It was his own idea .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	18	Along with Titus , we are sending another brother . All the churches praise him for his service in telling the good news .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	19	He was also chosen by the churches to go with us as we bring the offering . We are in charge of it . We want to honor the Lord himself . We want to show how ready we are to help .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	20	We want to keep anyone from blaming us for how we take care of that large gift .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	21	We are trying hard to do what both the Lord and people think is right .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	22	We are also sending another one of our brothers with them . He has often proved to us in many ways that he is very committed . He is now even more committed because he has great faith in you .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	8	23	Titus is my helper . He and I work together among you . Our brothers are messengers from the churches . They honor Christ .

NIRV	2%20Corinthians	9	2	I know how much you want to help . I have been bragging about it to the people in Macedonia . I have been telling them that since last year you who live in Achaia were ready to give . You are so excited that it has stirred up most of them to take action .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	9	9	It is written , “ They have spread their gifts around to poor people . Their good works continue forever. ” ( Psalm 112:9 )
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	9	3	But I am sending the brothers . Then our bragging about you in this matter will have a good reason . You will be ready , just as I said you would be .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	9	4	Suppose people from Macedonia come with me and find out that you are not prepared . Then we , as well as you , would be ashamed of being so certain .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	9	5	So I thought I should try to get the brothers to visit you ahead of time . They will finish the plans for the large gift you had promised . Then it will be ready as a gift freely given . It will not be given by force . Paul ’ s Advice to Give Freely
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	9	6	Here is something to remember . The one who plants only a little will gather only a little . And the one who plants a lot will gather a lot .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	9	7	Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give . You shouldn ’ t give if you don ’ t want to . You shouldn ’ t give because you are forced to . God loves a cheerful giver .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to shower all kinds of blessings on you . So in all things and at all times you will have everything you need . You will do more and more good works .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	9	10	God supplies seed for the person who plants . He supplies bread for food . God will also supply and increase the amount of your seed . He will increase the results of your good works .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	9	11	You will be made rich in every way . Then you can always give freely . We will take your many gifts to the people who need them . And they will give thanks to God .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	9	12	Your gifts meet the needs of the Lord ’ s people . And that ’ s not all . Your gifts also cause many people to thank God .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	9	13	You have shown yourselves to be worthy by what you have given . So other people will praise God because you obey him . That proves that you really believe the good news about Christ . They will also praise God because you share freely with them and with everyone else .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	9	14	Their hearts will be filled with love for you when they pray for you . God has given you grace that is better than anything .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	9	15	Let us give thanks to God for his gift . It is so great that no one can tell how wonderful it really is ! Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Corinthians	10	2	I am coming to see you . Please don ’ t make me be as bold as I expect to be toward some people . They think that I live the way the people of this world live .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	10	10	Some say , “ His letters sound important . They are powerful . But in person he doesn ’ t seem like much . And what he says doesn ’ t amount to anything. ”
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	10	3	I do live in the world . But I don ’ t fight my battles the way the people of the world do .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	10	4	The weapons I fight with are not the weapons the world uses . In fact , it is just the opposite . My weapons have the power of God to destroy the camps of the enemy .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	10	5	I destroy every claim and every reason that keeps people from knowing God . I keep every thought under control in order to make it obey Christ .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	10	6	Until you have obeyed completely , I will be ready to punish you every time you don ’ t obey .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	10	7	You are judging only by how things look on the surface . Suppose someone is sure they belong to Christ . Then they should consider again that we belong to Christ just as much as they do .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	10	8	Do I brag too much about the authority the Lord gave me ? If I do , it ’ s because I want to build you up , not tear you down . And I ’ m not ashamed of that kind of bragging .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	10	9	Don ’ t think that I ’ m trying to scare you with my letters .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	10	11	People like that have a lot to learn . What I say in my letters when I ’ m away from you , I will do in my actions when I ’ m with you .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	10	12	I don ’ t dare to compare myself with those who praise themselves . I ’ m not that kind of person . They measure themselves by themselves . They compare themselves with themselves . When they do that , they are not wise .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	10	13	But I won ’ t brag more than I should . God himself has given me an opportunity for serving . I will only brag about what I have done with that opportunity . This opportunity for serving also includes you .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	10	14	I am not going too far in my bragging . I would be going too far if I hadn ’ t come to where you live . But I did get there with the good news about Christ .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	10	15	And I won ’ t brag about work done by others . If I did , I would be bragging more than I should . As your faith continues to grow , I hope that my work among you will greatly increase .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	10	16	Then I will be able to preach the good news in the areas beyond you . I don ’ t want to brag about work already done in someone else ’ s territory .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	10	17	But , “ The one who brags should brag about what the Lord has done. ” ( Jeremiah 9:24 )

NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	2	My jealousy for you comes from God himself . I promised to give you to only one husband . That husband is Christ . I wanted to be able to give you to him as if you were a pure virgin .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	11	Why ? Because I don ’ t love you ? No ! God knows I do !
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	3	But Eve ’ s mind was tricked by the snake ’ s clever lies . And here ’ s what I ’ m afraid of . Your minds will also somehow be led astray . They will be led away from your true and pure love for Christ .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	4	Suppose someone comes to you and preaches about a Jesus different from the Jesus we preached about . Or suppose you receive a spirit different from the Spirit you received before . Or suppose you receive a different message of good news . Suppose it was different from the one you accepted earlier . You put up with those kinds of things easily enough .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	5	I don ’ t think I ’ m in any way less important than those “ super-apostles. ”
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	6	It ’ s true that I haven ’ t been trained as a speaker . But I do have knowledge . I ’ ve made that very clear to you in every way .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	7	I preached God ’ s good news to you free of charge . When I did that , I was putting myself down in order to lift you up . Was this a sin ?
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I received help from other churches so I could serve you . This was almost like robbing them .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	9	When I was with you and needed something , I didn ’ t cause you any expense . The believers who came from Macedonia gave me what I needed . I haven ’ t caused you any expense at all . And I won ’ t ever do it .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	10	I ’ m sure that the truth of Christ is in me . And I ’ m just as sure that nobody in Achaia will keep me from bragging .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	12	And I will keep on doing what I ’ m doing . That will stop those who claim they have things to brag about . They think they have a chance to be considered equal with us .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	13	People like that are false apostles . They are workers who tell lies . They only pretend to be apostles of Christ .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	14	That comes as no surprise . Even Satan himself pretends to be an angel of light .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	15	So it doesn ’ t surprise us that Satan ’ s servants also pretend to be serving God . They will finally get exactly what they deserve . Paul Brags About His Sufferings
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	16	I will say it again . Don ’ t let anyone think I ’ m a fool . But if you do , put up with me just as you would put up with a fool . Then I can do a little bragging .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	17	When I brag about myself like this , I ’ m not talking the way the Lord would . I ’ m talking like a fool .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Many are bragging the way the people of the world do . So I will brag like that too .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	19	You are so wise ! You gladly put up with fools !
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	20	In fact , you even put up with anyone who makes you a slave or uses you . You put up with those who take advantage of you . You put up with those who claim to be better than you . You put up with those who slap you in the face .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	21	I ’ m ashamed to have to say that I was too weak for that ! Whatever anyone else dares to brag about , I also dare to brag about . I ’ m speaking like a fool !
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Do they belong to the people of Israel ? So do I . Are they Abraham ’ s children ? So am I .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	23	Are they serving Christ ? I am serving him even more . I ’ m out of my mind to talk like this ! I have worked much harder . I have been in prison more often . I have suffered terrible beatings . Again and again I almost died .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	24	Five times the Jews gave me
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	39	strokes with a whip .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	25	Three times I was beaten with sticks . Once they tried to kill me by throwing stones at me . Three times I was shipwrecked . I spent a night and a day in the open sea .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	26	I have had to keep on the move . I have been in danger from rivers . I have been in danger from robbers . I have been in danger from my fellow Jews and in danger from Gentiles . I have been in danger in the city , in the country , and at sea . I have been in danger from people who pretended they were believers .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	27	I have worked very hard . Often I have gone without sleep . I have been hungry and thirsty . Often I have gone without food . I have been cold and naked .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	28	Besides everything else , every day I am concerned about all the churches . It is a very heavy load .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	29	If anyone is weak , I feel weak . If anyone is led into sin , I burn on the inside .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	30	If I have to brag , I will brag about the things that show how weak I am .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	31	I am not lying . The God and Father of the Lord Jesus knows this . May God be praised forever .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	32	In Damascus the governor who served under King Aretas had their city guarded . He wanted to arrest me .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	11	33	But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall . So I escaped from the governor . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	2	I know a believer in Christ who was taken up to the third heaven
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	12	While I was with you , I kept on showing you the actions of a true apostle . These actions include signs , wonders and miracles .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	14	Now I am ready to visit you for the third time . I won ’ t cause you any expense . I don ’ t want what you have . What I really want is you . After all , children shouldn ’ t have to save up for their parents . Parents should save up for their children .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	3	I don ’ t know if that man was in his body or out of it . Only God knows . But I do know that
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	4	he was taken up to paradise . He heard things there that couldn ’ t be put into words . They were things that no one is allowed to talk about .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	5	I will brag about a man like that . But I won ’ t brag about myself . I will brag only about how weak I am .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	6	Suppose I decide to brag . That would not make me a fool , because I would be telling the truth . But I don ’ t brag , so that no one will think more of me than they should . People should judge me by what I do and say .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	7	God has shown me amazing and wonderful things . People should not think more of me because of it . So I wouldn ’ t become proud of myself , I was given a problem . This problem caused pain in my body . It is a messenger from Satan to make me suffer .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	8	Three times I begged the Lord to take it away from me .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	9	But he said to me , “ My grace is all you need . My power is strongest when you are weak. ” So I am very happy to brag about how weak I am . Then Christ ’ s power can rest on me .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	10	Because of how I suffered for Christ , I ’ m glad that I am weak . I am glad in hard times . I am glad when people say mean things about me . I am glad when things are difficult . And I am glad when people make me suffer . When I am weak , I am strong . Paul ’ s Concern for the People of Corinth
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I have made a fool of myself . But you made me do it . You should have praised me . Even though I am nothing , I am in no way less important than the “ super-apostles. ”
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	13	How were you less important than the other churches ? The only difference was that I didn ’ t cause you any expense . Forgive me for that wrong !
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	15	So I will be very happy to spend everything I have for you . I will even spend myself . If I love you more , will you love me less ?
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	16	In any case , I haven ’ t caused you any expense . But I ’ m so tricky ! I have caught you by tricking you ! Or so you think !
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	17	Did I take advantage of you through any of the men I sent to you ?
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	18	I asked Titus to go to you . And I sent our brother with him . Titus didn ’ t take advantage of you , did he ? Didn ’ t we walk in the same footsteps by the same Spirit ?
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	19	All this time , have you been thinking that I ’ ve been speaking up for myself ? No , I ’ ve been speaking with God as my witness . I ’ ve been speaking like a believer in Christ . Dear friends , everything I do is to help you become stronger .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	20	I ’ m afraid that when I come I won ’ t find you as I want you to be . I ’ m afraid that you won ’ t find me as you want me to be . I ’ m afraid there will be arguing , jealousy and fits of anger . I ’ m afraid each of you will focus only on getting ahead . Then you will tell lies about each other . You will talk about each other . I ’ m afraid you will be proud and cause trouble .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	12	21	I ’ m afraid that when I come again my God will put me to shame in front of you . Then I will be sad about many who sinned earlier and have not turned away from it . They have not turned away from uncleanness , sexual sins and wild living . They have done all those things . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Corinthians	13	13	All God ’ s people here send their greetings .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	13	3	You are asking me to prove that Christ is speaking through me . He is not weak in dealing with you . He is powerful among you .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	13	4	It is true that Christ was nailed to the cross because he was weak . But Christ lives by God ’ s power . In the same way , we share his weakness . But by God ’ s power we will live with Christ as we serve you .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	13	5	Take a good look at yourselves to see if you are really believers . Test yourselves . Don ’ t you realize that Christ Jesus is in you ? Unless , of course , you fail the test !
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	13	6	I hope you will discover that I haven ’ t failed the test .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	13	7	I pray to God that you won ’ t do anything wrong . I don ’ t pray so that people will see that I have passed the test . Instead , I pray this so that you will do what is right , even if it seems I have failed .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	13	8	I can ’ t do anything to stop the truth . I can only work for the truth .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	13	9	I ’ m glad when I am weak but you are strong . I pray that there will be no more problems among you .
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	13	10	That ’ s why I write these things before I come to you . Then when I do come , I won ’ t have to be hard on you when I use my authority . The Lord gave me the authority to build you up . He didn ’ t give it to me to tear you down . Final Greetings
NIRV	2%20Corinthians	13	11	Finally , brothers and sisters , be joyful ! Work to make things right with one another . Help one another and agree with one another . Live in peace . And the God who gives love and peace will be with you .

NIRV	Galatians	1	1	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I am an apostle . People have not sent me . No human authority has sent me . I have been sent by Jesus Christ and by God the Father . God raised Jesus from the dead .
NIRV	Galatians	1	2	All the brothers and sisters who are with me join me in writing . We are sending this letter to you , the members of the churches in Galatia .
NIRV	Galatians	1	3	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
NIRV	Galatians	1	4	Jesus gave his life for our sins . He set us free from this evil world . That was what our God and Father wanted .
NIRV	Galatians	1	5	Give glory to God for ever and ever . Amen . There Is No Other Good News
NIRV	Galatians	1	6	I am amazed . You are so quickly deserting the one who chose you . He chose you to live in the grace that Christ has provided . You are turning to a different “ good news. ”
NIRV	Galatians	1	7	What you are accepting is really not the good news at all . It seems that some people have gotten you all mixed up . They are trying to twist the good news about Christ .
NIRV	Galatians	1	8	But suppose even we should preach a different “ good news. ” Suppose even an angel from heaven should preach it . Suppose it is different from the good news we gave you . Then let anyone who does that be cursed by God .
NIRV	Galatians	1	9	I have already said it . Now I will say it again . Suppose someone preaches a “ good news ” that is different from what you accepted . That person should be cursed by God .
NIRV	Galatians	1	10	Am I now trying to get people to think well of me ? Or do I want God to think well of me ? Am I trying to please people ? If I were , I would not be serving Christ . Paul Was Appointed by God
NIRV	Galatians	1	11	Brothers and sisters , here is what I want you to know . The good news I preached does not come from human beings .
NIRV	Galatians	1	12	No one gave it to me . No one taught it to me . Instead , I received it from Jesus Christ . He showed it to me .
NIRV	Galatians	1	13	You have heard how I lived earlier in my Jewish way of life . With all my strength I attacked the church of God . I tried to destroy it .
NIRV	Galatians	1	14	I was moving ahead in my Jewish way of life . I went beyond many of my people who were my own age . I held firmly to the teachings passed down by my people .
NIRV	Galatians	1	15	days .
NIRV	Galatians	1	16	to show his Son in my life . He wanted me to preach about Jesus among the Gentiles . When God appointed me , I decided right away not to ask anyone for advice .
NIRV	Galatians	1	17	I didn ’ t go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was . Instead , I went into Arabia . Later I returned to Damascus .
NIRV	Galatians	1	18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem . I went there to get to know Peter . I stayed with him for
NIRV	Galatians	1	19	I didn ’ t see any of the other apostles . I only saw James , the Lord ’ s brother .
NIRV	Galatians	1	20	Here is what you can be sure of . And God is even a witness to it . What I am writing you is not a lie .
NIRV	Galatians	1	21	Then I went to Syria and Cilicia .
NIRV	Galatians	1	22	The members of Christ ’ s churches in Judea did not know me in a personal way .
NIRV	Galatians	1	23	They only heard others say , “ The man who used to attack us has changed . He is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy. ”
NIRV	Galatians	1	24	And they praised God because of me . Copyright ©

NIRV	Galatians	2	2	I went because God showed me what he wanted me to do . I spoke in private to those who are respected as leaders . I told them the good news that I preach among the Gentiles . I wanted to be sure I wasn ’ t running my race for no purpose . And I wanted to know that I had not been running my race for no purpose .
NIRV	Galatians	2	3	Titus was with me . He was a Greek . But even he was not forced to be circumcised .
NIRV	Galatians	2	4	This matter came up because some people had slipped in among us . They had pretended to be believers . They wanted to find out about the freedom we have because we belong to Christ Jesus . They wanted to make us slaves again .
NIRV	Galatians	2	5	We didn ’ t give in to them for a moment . We did this so that the truth of the good news would be kept safe for you .
NIRV	Galatians	2	6	Some people in Jerusalem were thought to be important . But it makes no difference to me what they were . God does not treat people differently . Those people added nothing to my message .
NIRV	Galatians	2	7	In fact , it was just the opposite . They recognized the task I had been trusted with . It was the task of preaching the good news to the Gentiles . My task was like Peter ’ s task . He had been trusted with the task of preaching to the Jews .
NIRV	Galatians	2	8	God was working in Peter as an apostle to the Jews . God was also working in me as an apostle to the Gentiles .
NIRV	Galatians	2	9	James , Peter and John are respected as pillars in the church . They recognized the special grace given to me . So they shook my hand and the hand of Barnabas . They wanted to show they accepted us . They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles . They would go to the Jews .
NIRV	Galatians	2	10	They asked only one thing . They wanted us to continue to remember poor people . That was what I had wanted to do all along . Paul Opposes Peter
NIRV	Galatians	2	11	When Peter came to Antioch , I told him to his face that I was against what he was doing . He was clearly wrong .
NIRV	Galatians	2	12	He used to eat with the Gentiles . But certain men came from a group sent by James . When they arrived , Peter began to draw back . He separated himself from the Gentiles . That ’ s because he was afraid of the circumcision group sent by James .
NIRV	Galatians	2	13	Peter ’ s actions were not honest , and other Jews in Antioch joined him . Even Barnabas was led astray .
NIRV	Galatians	2	14	I saw what they were doing . It was not in line with the truth of the good news . So I spoke to Peter in front of them all . “ You are a Jew , ” I said . “ But you live like one who is not . So why do you force Gentiles to follow Jewish ways ? ”
NIRV	Galatians	2	15	We are Jews by birth . We are not sinful Gentiles .
NIRV	Galatians	2	16	Here is what we know . No one is made right with God by obeying the law . It is by believing in Jesus Christ . So we too have put our faith in Christ Jesus . This is so we can be made right with God by believing in Christ . We are not made right by obeying the law . That ’ s because no one can be made right with God by obeying the law .
NIRV	Galatians	2	17	We are seeking to be made right with God through Christ . As we do , what if we find that we who are Jews are also sinners ? Does that mean that Christ causes us to sin ? Certainly not !
NIRV	Galatians	2	18	Suppose I build again what I had destroyed . Then I would really be breaking the law .
NIRV	Galatians	2	19	By the law , I died as far as the law is concerned . I died so that I might live for God .
NIRV	Galatians	2	20	I have been crucified with Christ . I don ’ t live any longer , but Christ lives in me . Now I live my life in my body by faith in the Son of God . He loved me and gave himself for me .

NIRV	Galatians	3	3	Are you so foolish ? You began by the Holy Spirit . Are you now trying to finish God ’ s work in you by your own strength ?
NIRV	Galatians	3	2	I would like to learn just one thing from you . Did you receive the Holy Spirit by obeying the law ? Or did you receive the Spirit by believing what you heard ?
NIRV	Galatians	3	4	Have you experienced so much for nothing ? And was it really for nothing ?
NIRV	Galatians	3	5	So I ask you again , how does God give you his Spirit ? How does he work miracles among you ? Is it by doing what the law says ? Or is it by believing what you have heard ?
NIRV	Galatians	3	6	In the same way , Abraham “ believed God . God was pleased with Abraham because he believed . So his faith made him right with God. ” ( Genesis 15:6 )
NIRV	Galatians	3	7	So you see , those who have faith are children of Abraham .
NIRV	Galatians	3	8	Long ago , Scripture knew that God would make the Gentiles right with himself . He would do this by their faith in him . He announced the good news ahead of time to Abraham . God said , “ All nations will be blessed because of you. ” ( Genesis 12:3 ; 18:18 ; 22:18 )
NIRV	Galatians	3	9	So those who depend on faith are blessed along with Abraham . He was the man of faith .
NIRV	Galatians	3	10	All who depend on obeying the law are under a curse . It is written , “ May everyone who doesn ’ t continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law be under God ’ s curse. ” ( Deuteronomy 27:26 )
NIRV	Galatians	3	11	We know that no one who depends on the law is made right with God . This is because “ the one who is right with God will live by faith. ” ( Habakkuk 2:4 )
NIRV	Galatians	3	12	The law is not based on faith . In fact , it is just the opposite . It teaches that “ the person who does these things will live by them. ” ( Leviticus 18:5 )
NIRV	Galatians	3	13	Christ set us free from the curse of the law . He did it by becoming a curse for us . It is written , “ Everyone who is hung on a pole is under God ’ s curse. ” ( Deuteronomy 21:23 )
NIRV	Galatians	3	14	Christ Jesus set us free so that the blessing given to Abraham would come to the Gentiles through Christ . He did it so that we might receive the promise of the Holy Spirit . The promised Spirit comes by believing in Christ . The Law and the Promise
NIRV	Galatians	3	15	Brothers and sisters , let me give you an example from everyday life . No one can get rid of an official agreement between people . No one can add to it . It can ’ t be changed after it has been made . It is the same with God ’ s covenant agreement .
NIRV	Galatians	3	16	The promises were given to Abraham . They were also given to his seed . Scripture does not say , “ and to seeds. ” That means many people . It says , “ and to your seed. ” ( Genesis 12:7 ; 13:15 ; 24:7 ) That means one person . And that one person is Christ .
NIRV	Galatians	3	17	Here is what I mean . The law came
NIRV	Galatians	3	430	years after the promise . But the law does not get rid of God ’ s covenant and promise . The covenant had already been made by God . So the law does not do away with the promise .
NIRV	Galatians	3	18	The great gift that God has for us does not depend on the law . If it did , it would no longer depend on the promise . But God gave it to Abraham as a free gift through a promise .
NIRV	Galatians	3	19	Then why was the law given at all ? It was added because of human sin . And it was supposed to control us until the promised Seed had come . The law was given through angels , and a go-between was put in charge of it .
NIRV	Galatians	3	20	A go-between means that there is more than one side to an agreement . But God didn ’ t use a go-between when he made his promise to Abraham .
NIRV	Galatians	3	21	So is the law opposed to God ’ s promises ? Certainly not ! What if a law had been given that could give life ? Then people could become right with God by obeying the law .
NIRV	Galatians	3	22	But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin . It does so in order that what was promised might be given to those who believe . The promise comes through faith in Jesus Christ . Children of God
NIRV	Galatians	3	23	Before faith in Christ came , we were guarded by the law . We were locked up until this faith was made known .
NIRV	Galatians	3	24	So the law was put in charge of us until Christ came . He came so that we might be made right with God by believing in Christ .
NIRV	Galatians	3	25	But now faith in Christ has come . So the law is no longer in charge of us .
NIRV	Galatians	3	26	So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God by believing in Christ .
NIRV	Galatians	3	27	This is because all of you who were baptized into Christ have put on Christ . You have put him on as if he were your clothes .
NIRV	Galatians	3	28	There is no Jew or Gentile . There is no slave or free person . There is no male or female . That ’ s because you are all one in Christ Jesus .
NIRV	Galatians	3	29	You who belong to Christ are Abraham ’ s seed . So you will receive what God has promised . Copyright ©

NIRV	Galatians	4	4	But then the chosen time came . God sent his Son . A woman gave birth to him . He was born under the authority of the law .
NIRV	Galatians	4	2	People are in charge of the property . And other people are in charge of the children . The children remain under their care until they become adults . At that time their fathers give them the property .
NIRV	Galatians	4	3	It is the same with us . When we were children , we were slaves to the basic spiritual powers of the world .
NIRV	Galatians	4	5	He came to set free those who were under the authority of the law . He wanted us to be adopted as children with all the rights children have .
NIRV	Galatians	4	6	Because you are his children , God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts . He is the Holy Spirit . By his power we call God Abba . Abba means Father .
NIRV	Galatians	4	7	So you aren ’ t a slave any longer . You are God ’ s child . Because you are his child , God gives you the rights of those who are his children . Paul ’ s Concern for the Believers in Galatia
NIRV	Galatians	4	8	At one time you didn ’ t know God . You were slaves to gods that are really not gods at all .
NIRV	Galatians	4	9	But now you know God . Even better , God knows you . So why are you turning back to those weak and worthless powers ? Do you want to be slaves to them all over again ?
NIRV	Galatians	4	10	You are observing special days and months and seasons and years !
NIRV	Galatians	4	11	I am afraid for you . I am afraid that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you .
NIRV	Galatians	4	12	I make my appeal to you , brothers and sisters . I ’ m asking you to become like me . After all , I became like you . You didn ’ t do anything wrong to me .
NIRV	Galatians	4	13	Remember when I first preached the good news to you ? Remember I did that because I was sick .
NIRV	Galatians	4	14	And my sickness was hard on you . But you weren ’ t mean to me . You didn ’ t make fun of me . Instead , you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God . You welcomed me as if I were Christ Jesus himself .
NIRV	Galatians	4	15	So why aren ’ t you treating me the same way now ? Suppose you could have torn out your own eyes and given them to me . Then you would have done it . I am a witness to this .
NIRV	Galatians	4	16	Have I become your enemy now by telling you the truth ?
NIRV	Galatians	4	17	Those people are trying hard to win you over . But it is not for your good . They want to take you away from us . They want you to commit yourselves to them .
NIRV	Galatians	4	18	It is fine to be committed to something , if the purpose is good . And you shouldn ’ t be committed only when I am with you . You should always be committed .
NIRV	Galatians	4	19	My dear children , I am in pain for you like I was when we first met . I have pain like a woman giving birth . And my pain will continue until Christ makes you like himself .
NIRV	Galatians	4	20	I wish I could be with you now . I wish I could change my tone of voice . As it is , I don ’ t understand you . Hagar and Sarah
NIRV	Galatians	4	21	You who want to be under the authority of the law , tell me something . Don ’ t you know what the law says ?
NIRV	Galatians	4	22	It is written that Abraham had two sons . The slave woman gave birth to one of them . The free woman gave birth to the other one .
NIRV	Galatians	4	23	Abraham ’ s son by the slave woman was born in the usual way . But his son by the free woman was born because of God ’ s promise .
NIRV	Galatians	4	24	These things are examples . The two women stand for two covenants . One covenant comes from Mount Sinai . It gives birth to children who are going to be slaves . It is Hagar .
NIRV	Galatians	4	25	Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia . She stands for the present city of Jerusalem . That ’ s because she and her children are slaves .
NIRV	Galatians	4	26	But the Jerusalem that is above is free . She is our mother .
NIRV	Galatians	4	27	It is written , “ Be glad , woman , you who have never had children . Shout for joy and cry out loud , you who have never had labor pains . The woman who is all alone has more children than the woman who has a husband. ” ( Isaiah 54:1 )
NIRV	Galatians	4	28	Brothers and sisters , you are children because of God ’ s promise just as Isaac was .
NIRV	Galatians	4	29	At that time , the son born in the usual way tried to hurt the other son . The other son was born by the power of the Holy Spirit . It is the same now .
NIRV	Galatians	4	30	But what does Scripture say ? “ Get rid of the slave woman . Get rid of her son . The slave woman ’ s son will never have a share of the family ’ s property . He ’ ll never share it with the free woman ’ s son. ” ( Genesis 21:10 )
NIRV	Galatians	4	31	Brothers and sisters , we are not the slave woman ’ s children . We are the free woman ’ s children . Copyright ©

NIRV	Galatians	5	5	But we long to be made completely holy because of our faith in Christ . Through the Holy Spirit we wait for this in hope .
NIRV	Galatians	5	2	Here is what I , Paul , say to you . Don ’ t let yourselves be circumcised . If you do , Christ won ’ t be of any value to you .
NIRV	Galatians	5	3	I say it again . Every man who lets himself be circumcised must obey the whole law .
NIRV	Galatians	5	4	Some of you are trying to be made right with God by obeying the law . You have been separated from Christ . You have fallen away from God ’ s grace .
NIRV	Galatians	5	6	Circumcision and uncircumcision aren ’ t worth anything to those who believe in Christ Jesus . The only thing that really counts is faith that shows itself through love .
NIRV	Galatians	5	7	You were running a good race . Who has kept you from obeying the truth ?
NIRV	Galatians	5	8	The God who chooses you does not keep you from obeying the truth .
NIRV	Galatians	5	9	You should know that “ just a little yeast works its way through the whole batch of dough. ”
NIRV	Galatians	5	10	The Lord makes me certain that you will see the truth of this . The one who has gotten you all mixed up will have to pay the price . This will happen no matter who has done it .
NIRV	Galatians	5	11	Brothers and sisters , I no longer preach that people must be circumcised . If I did , why am I still being opposed ? If I preached that , then the cross wouldn ’ t upset anyone .
NIRV	Galatians	5	12	So then , what about troublemakers who try to get others to be circumcised ? I wish they would go the whole way ! I wish they would cut off everything that marks them as men ! Living by the Holy Spirit ’ s Power
NIRV	Galatians	5	13	My brothers and sisters , you were chosen to be free . But don ’ t use your freedom as an excuse to live under the power of sin . Instead , serve one another in love .
NIRV	Galatians	5	14	The whole law is fulfilled by obeying this one command . “ Love your neighbor as you love yourself. ” ( Leviticus 19:18 )
NIRV	Galatians	5	15	If you say or do things that harm one another , watch out ! You could end up destroying one another .
NIRV	Galatians	5	16	So I say , live by the Holy Spirit ’ s power . Then you will not do what your desires controlled by sin want you to do .
NIRV	Galatians	5	17	The desires controlled by sin do not want what the Spirit delights in . And the Spirit does not want what the desires controlled by sin delight in . The two are at war with each other . That ’ s why you are not supposed to do whatever you want .
NIRV	Galatians	5	18	But if you are led by the Spirit , you are not under the authority of the law .
NIRV	Galatians	5	19	The result of sin ’ s control in our lives is clear . It includes sexual sins , impure acts and wild living .
NIRV	Galatians	5	20	It includes worshiping statues of gods and worshiping evil powers . It also includes hatred and fighting , jealousy and fits of anger . Sinful desire is interested only in getting ahead . It stirs up trouble . It separates people into their own little groups .
NIRV	Galatians	5	21	It wants what others have . It gets drunk and takes part in wild parties . It does many things of that kind . I warn you now as I did before . People who live like this will not receive God ’ s kingdom .
NIRV	Galatians	5	22	But the fruit the Holy Spirit produces is love , joy and peace . It is being patient , kind and good . It is being faithful
NIRV	Galatians	5	23	and gentle and having control of oneself . There is no law against things of that kind .
NIRV	Galatians	5	24	Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed their sinful desires to his cross . They don ’ t want these things anymore .
NIRV	Galatians	5	25	Since we live by the Spirit , let us keep in step with the Spirit .
NIRV	Galatians	5	26	Let us not become proud . Let us not make each other angry . Let us not want what belongs to others . Copyright ©

NIRV	Galatians	6	6	But those who are taught the word should share all good things with their teacher .
NIRV	Galatians	6	2	Carry one another ’ s heavy loads . If you do , you will fulfill the law of Christ .
NIRV	Galatians	6	3	If anyone thinks they are somebody when they are nobody , they are fooling themselves .
NIRV	Galatians	6	4	Each person should test their own actions . Then they can take pride in themselves . They won ’ t be comparing themselves to someone else .
NIRV	Galatians	6	5	Each person should carry their own load .
NIRV	Galatians	6	7	Don ’ t be fooled . You can ’ t outsmart God . A man gathers a crop from what he plants .
NIRV	Galatians	6	8	Some people plant to please their desires controlled by sin . From these desires they will harvest death . Others plant to please the Holy Spirit . From the Spirit they will harvest eternal life .
NIRV	Galatians	6	9	Let us not become tired of doing good . At the right time we will gather a crop if we don ’ t give up .
NIRV	Galatians	6	10	So when we can do good to everyone , let us do it . Let ’ s try even harder to do good to the family of believers . Not Circumcision but the New Creation
NIRV	Galatians	6	11	Look at the big letters I ’ m using as I write to you with my own hand !
NIRV	Galatians	6	12	Some people are worried about how things look on the outside . They are trying to force you to be circumcised . They do it for only one reason . They don ’ t want to suffer by being connected with the cross of Christ .
NIRV	Galatians	6	13	Even those who are circumcised don ’ t obey the law . But they want you to be circumcised . Then they can brag about what has been done to your body .
NIRV	Galatians	6	14	I never want to brag about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ . Through that cross the ways of the world have been crucified as far as I am concerned . And I have been crucified as far as the ways of the world are concerned .
NIRV	Galatians	6	15	Circumcision and uncircumcision don ’ t mean anything . What really counts is that the new creation has come .
NIRV	Galatians	6	16	May peace and mercy be given to all who follow this rule . May peace and mercy be given to the Israel that belongs to God .
NIRV	Galatians	6	17	From now on , let no one cause trouble for me . My body has marks that show I belong to Jesus .
NIRV	Galatians	6	18	Brothers and sisters , may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ephesians	1	1	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I am an apostle of Christ Jesus just as God planned . I am sending this letter to you , God ’ s holy people in Ephesus . Because you belong to Christ Jesus , you are faithful .
NIRV	Ephesians	1	2	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace . Praise God for His Spiritual Blessings in Christ
NIRV	Ephesians	1	3	Give praise to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . He has blessed us with every spiritual blessing . Those blessings come from the heavenly world . They belong to us because we belong to Christ .
NIRV	Ephesians	1	4	God chose us to belong to Christ before the world was created . He chose us to be holy and without blame in his eyes . He loved us .
NIRV	Ephesians	1	5	So he decided long ago to adopt us . He adopted us as his children with all the rights children have . He did it because of what Jesus Christ has done . It pleased God to do it .
NIRV	Ephesians	1	6	All those things bring praise to his glorious grace . God freely gave us his grace because of the One he loves .
NIRV	Ephesians	1	7	We have been set free because of what Christ has done . Because he bled and died our sins have been forgiven . We have been set free because God ’ s grace is so rich .
NIRV	Ephesians	1	8	He poured his grace on us . By giving us great wisdom and understanding ,
NIRV	Ephesians	1	9	he showed us the mystery of his plan . It was in keeping with what he wanted to do . It was what he had planned through Christ .
NIRV	Ephesians	1	10	It will all come about when history has been completed . God will then bring together all things in heaven and on earth under Christ .
NIRV	Ephesians	1	11	We were also chosen to belong to him . God decided to choose us long ago in keeping with his plan . He works out everything to fit his plan and purpose .
NIRV	Ephesians	1	12	We were the first to put our hope in Christ . We were chosen to bring praise to his glory .
NIRV	Ephesians	1	13	You also became believers in Christ . That happened when you heard the message of truth . It was the good news about how you could be saved . When you believed , he stamped you with an official mark . That official mark is the Holy Spirit that he promised .
NIRV	Ephesians	1	14	The Spirit marks us as God ’ s own . We can now be sure that someday we will receive all that God has promised . That will happen after God sets all his people completely free . All these things will bring praise to his glory . Paul Prays and Gives Thanks
NIRV	Ephesians	1	15	I have heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus . I have also heard about your love for all God ’ s people . That is why
NIRV	Ephesians	1	16	I have not stopped thanking God for you . I always remember you in my prayers .
NIRV	Ephesians	1	17	I pray to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ . God is the glorious Father . I keep asking him to give you the wisdom and understanding that come from the Holy Spirit . I want you to know God better .
NIRV	Ephesians	1	18	I pray that you may understand more clearly . Then you will know the hope God has chosen you to receive . You will know that what God will give his holy people is rich and glorious .
NIRV	Ephesians	1	19	And you will know God ’ s great power . It can ’ t be compared with anything else . His power works for us who believe . It is the same mighty strength
NIRV	Ephesians	1	20	God showed . He showed this when he raised Christ from the dead . God seated him at his right hand in his heavenly kingdom .
NIRV	Ephesians	1	21	There Christ sits far above all who rule and have authority . He also sits far above all powers and kings . He is above every name that is appealed to in this world and in the world to come .
NIRV	Ephesians	1	22	God placed all things under Christ ’ s rule . He appointed him to be ruler over everything for the church .
NIRV	Ephesians	1	23	The church is Christ ’ s body and is filled by Christ . He fills everything in every way . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ephesians	2	2	You used to live as sinners when you followed the ways of this world . You served the one who rules over the spiritual forces of evil . He is the spirit who is now at work in those who don ’ t obey God .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	3	At one time we all lived among them . Our desires were controlled by sin . We tried to satisfy what they wanted us to do . We followed our desires and thoughts . God was angry with us like he was with everyone else . That ’ s because of the kind of people we all were .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	4	But God loves us deeply . He is full of mercy .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	5	So he gave us new life because of what Christ has done . He gave us life even when we were dead in sin . God ’ s grace has saved you .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	6	God raised us up with Christ . He has seated us with him in his heavenly kingdom . That ’ s because we belong to Christ Jesus .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	7	He has done it to show the riches of his grace for all time to come . His grace can ’ t be compared with anything else . He has shown it by being kind to us . He was kind to us because of what Christ Jesus has done .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	8	God ’ s grace has saved you because of your faith in Christ . Your salvation doesn ’ t come from anything you do . It is God ’ s gift .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	9	It is not based on anything you have done . No one can brag about earning it .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	10	We are God ’ s creation . He created us to belong to Christ Jesus . Now we can do good works . Long ago God prepared these works for us to do . God ’ s New Family of Jews and Gentiles
NIRV	Ephesians	2	11	You who are not Jews by birth , here is what I want you to remember . You are called “ uncircumcised ” by those who call themselves “ circumcised. ” But they have only been circumcised in their bodies by human hands .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	12	Before you believed in Christ , you were separated from him . You were not considered to be citizens of Israel . You were not included in what the covenants promised . You were without hope and without God in the world .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	13	At one time you were far away from God . But now you belong to Christ Jesus . He spilled his blood for you . This has brought you near to God .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	14	Christ himself is our peace . He has made Jews and Gentiles into one group of people . He has destroyed the hatred that was like a wall between us .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	15	Through his body on the cross , Christ set aside the law with all its commands and rules . He planned to create one new people out of Jews and Gentiles . He wanted to make peace between them .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	16	He planned to bring both Jews and Gentiles back to God as one body . He planned to do this through the cross . On that cross , Christ put to death their hatred toward one another .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	17	He came and preached peace to you who were far away . He also preached peace to those who were near .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	18	Through Christ we both come to the Father by the power of one Holy Spirit .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	19	So you are no longer outsiders and strangers . You are citizens together with God ’ s people . You are also members of God ’ s family .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	20	You are a building that is built on the apostles and prophets . They are the foundation . Christ Jesus himself is the most important stone in the building .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	21	The whole building is held together by him . It rises to become a holy temple because it belongs to the Lord .
NIRV	Ephesians	2	22	And because you belong to him , you too are being built together . You are being made into a house where God lives through his Spirit . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ephesians	3	3	I ’ m talking about the mystery God showed me . I have already written a little about it .
NIRV	Ephesians	3	2	I am sure you have heard that God appointed me to share his grace with you .
NIRV	Ephesians	3	4	By reading about this mystery , you will be able to understand what I know . You will know about the mystery of Christ .
NIRV	Ephesians	3	5	The mystery was not made known to people of other times . But now the Holy Spirit has made this mystery known to God ’ s holy apostles and prophets .
NIRV	Ephesians	3	6	Here is the mystery . Because of the good news , God ’ s promises are for Gentiles as well as for Jews . Both groups are parts of one body . They share in the promise . It belongs to them because they belong to Christ Jesus .
NIRV	Ephesians	3	7	I now serve the good news because God gave me his grace . His power is at work in me .
NIRV	Ephesians	3	8	I am by far the least important of all the Lord ’ s holy people . But he gave me the grace to preach to the Gentiles about the unlimited riches that Christ gives .
NIRV	Ephesians	3	9	God told me to make clear to everyone how the mystery came about . In times past it was kept hidden in the mind of God , who created all things .
NIRV	Ephesians	3	10	He wanted the rulers and authorities in the heavenly world to come to know his great wisdom . The church would make it known to them .
NIRV	Ephesians	3	11	That was God ’ s plan from the beginning . He has fulfilled his plan through Christ Jesus our Lord .
NIRV	Ephesians	3	12	Through him and through faith in him we can approach God . We can come to him freely . We can come without fear .
NIRV	Ephesians	3	13	So here is what I ’ m asking you to do . Don ’ t lose hope because I am suffering for you . It will lead to the time when God will give you his glory . Paul Prays for the Ephesians
NIRV	Ephesians	3	14	I bow in prayer to the Father because of my work among you .
NIRV	Ephesians	3	15	From the Father every family in heaven and on earth gets its name .
NIRV	Ephesians	3	16	I pray that he will use his glorious riches to make you strong . May his Holy Spirit give you his power deep down inside you .
NIRV	Ephesians	3	17	Then Christ will live in your hearts because you believe in him . And I pray that your love will have deep roots . I pray that it will have a strong foundation .
NIRV	Ephesians	3	18	May you have power together with all the Lord ’ s holy people to understand Christ ’ s love . May you know how wide and long and high and deep it is .
NIRV	Ephesians	3	19	And may you know his love , even though it can ’ t be known completely . Then you will be filled with everything God has for you .
NIRV	Ephesians	3	20	God is able to do far more than we could ever ask for or imagine . He does everything by his power that is working in us .
NIRV	Ephesians	3	21	Give him glory in the church and in Christ Jesus . Give him glory through all time and for ever and ever . Amen . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ephesians	4	3	The Holy Spirit makes you one in every way . So try your best to remain as one . Let peace keep you together .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	5	There is one Lord , one faith and one baptism .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	6	There is one God and Father of all . He is over everything . He is through everything . He is in everything .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	7	But each one of us has received a gift of grace . These gifts are given to us by Christ .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	8	That is why Scripture says , “ When he went up to his place on high , he took many prisoners . He gave gifts to his people. ” ( Psalm 68:18 )
NIRV	Ephesians	4	9	What does “ he went up ” mean ? It can only mean that he also came down to the lower , earthly places .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	10	The one who came down is the same one who went up . He went up higher than all the heavens . He did it in order to fill all creation .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	11	So Christ himself gave the gift of the apostles to the church . He gave the prophets and those who preach the good news . And he also gave the pastors and teachers as a gift to the church .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	12	He gave all these people so that they might prepare God ’ s people to serve . Then the body of Christ will be built up .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	13	That will continue until we all become one in the faith . We will also become one in the knowledge of God ’ s Son . Then we will be grown up in the faith . We will receive everything that Christ has for us .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	14	We will no longer be babies in the faith . We won ’ t be like ships tossed around by the waves . We won ’ t be blown here and there by every new teaching . We won ’ t be blown around by cleverness and tricks . Certain people use them to hide their evil plans .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	15	Instead , we will speak the truth in love . So we will grow up in every way to become the body of Christ . Christ is the head of the body .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	16	He makes the whole body grow and build itself up in love . Under the control of Christ , each part of the body does its work . It supports the other parts . In that way , the body is joined and held together . Teachings for Living as Christians
NIRV	Ephesians	4	17	Here is what I ’ m telling you . I am speaking for the Lord as I warn you . You must no longer live as the Gentiles do . Their thoughts don ’ t have any purpose .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	18	They can ’ t understand the truth . They are separated from the life of God . That ’ s because they don ’ t know him . And they don ’ t know him because their hearts are stubborn .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	19	They have lost all feeling for what is right . So they have given themselves over to all kinds of evil pleasures . They take part in every kind of unclean act . And they are full of greed .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	20	But that is not the way of life in Christ that you learned about .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	21	You heard about Christ and were taught about life in him . What you learned was the truth about Jesus .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	22	You were taught not to live the way you used to . You must get rid of your old way of life . That ’ s because it has been made impure by the desire for things that lead you astray .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	23	You were taught to be made new in your thinking .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	24	You were taught to start living a new life . It is created to be truly good and holy , just as God is .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	25	So each of you must get rid of your lying . Speak the truth to your neighbor . We are all parts of one body .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	26	Scripture says , “ When you are angry , do not sin. ” ( Psalm 4:4 ) Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	27	Don ’ t give the devil a chance .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	28	Anyone who has been stealing must never steal again . Instead , they must work . They must do something useful with their own hands . Then they will have something to give to people in need .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	29	Don ’ t let any evil talk come out of your mouths . Say only what will help to build others up and meet their needs . Then what you say will help those who listen .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	30	Do not make God ’ s Holy Spirit mourn . The Holy Spirit is the proof that you belong to God . And the Spirit is the proof that God will set you completely free .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	31	Get rid of all hard feelings , anger and rage . Stop all fighting and lying . Don ’ t have anything to do with any kind of hatred .
NIRV	Ephesians	4	32	Be kind and tender to one another . Forgive one another , just as God forgave you because of what Christ has done . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ephesians	5	5	Here is what you can be sure of . Those who give themselves over to sexual sins are lost . So are people whose lives are impure . The same is true of those who always want more and more . People who do these things might as well worship statues of gods . No one who does them will receive a share in the kingdom of Christ and of God .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	1	You are the children that God dearly loves . So follow his example .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	2	Lead a life of love , just as Christ did . He loved us . He gave himself up for us . He was a sweet-smelling offering and sacrifice to God .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	3	There should not be even a hint of sexual sin among you . Don ’ t do anything impure . And do not always want more and more . These are not the things God ’ s holy people should do .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	4	There must not be any bad language or foolish talk or dirty jokes . They are out of place . Instead , you should give thanks .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	6	Don ’ t let anyone fool you with worthless words . People who say things like that aren ’ t obeying God . He is angry with them .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	7	So don ’ t go along with people like that .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	8	At one time you were in the dark . But now you are in the light because of what the Lord has done . Live like children of the light .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	9	The light produces what is completely good , right and true .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	10	Find out what pleases the Lord .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	11	Have nothing to do with the acts of darkness . They don ’ t produce anything good . Show what they are really like .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	12	It is shameful even to talk about what people who don ’ t obey do in secret .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	13	But everything the light shines on can be seen . And everything that the light shines on becomes a light .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	14	That is why it is said , “ Wake up , sleeper . Rise from the dead . Then Christ will shine on you. ”
NIRV	Ephesians	5	15	So be very careful how you live . Do not live like people who aren ’ t wise . Live like people who are wise .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	16	Make the most of every opportunity . The days are evil .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	17	So don ’ t be foolish . Instead , understand what the Lord wants .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	18	Don ’ t fill yourself up with wine . Getting drunk will lead to wild living . Instead , be filled with the Holy Spirit .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	19	Speak to one another with psalms , hymns and songs from the Spirit . Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	20	Always give thanks to God the Father for everything . Give thanks to him in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ . Teachings for Christian Families
NIRV	Ephesians	5	21	Follow the lead of one another because of your respect for Christ .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	22	Wives , follow the lead of your own husbands as you follow the Lord .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	23	The husband is the head of the wife , just as Christ is the head of the church . The church is Christ ’ s body . He is its Savior .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	24	The church follows the lead of Christ . In the same way , wives should follow the lead of their husbands in everything .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	25	Husbands , love your wives . Love them just as Christ loved the church . He gave himself up for her .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	26	He did it to make her holy . He made her clean by washing her with water and the word .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	27	He did it to bring her to himself as a brightly shining church . He wants a church that has no stain or wrinkle or any other flaw . He wants a church that is holy and without blame .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	28	In the same way , husbands should love their wives . They should love them as they love their own bodies . Any man who loves his wife loves himself .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	29	After all , no one ever hated their own body . Instead , they feed and care for their body . And this is what Christ does for the church .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	30	We are parts of his body .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	31	Scripture says , “ That ’ s why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife . The two will become one. ” ( Genesis 2:24 )
NIRV	Ephesians	5	32	That is a deep mystery . But I ’ m talking about Christ and the church .
NIRV	Ephesians	5	33	A husband also must love his wife . He must love her just as he loves himself . And a wife must respect her husband . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ephesians	6	6	Don ’ t obey them only to please them when they are watching . Do it because you are slaves of Christ . Be sure your heart does what God wants .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	2	Scripture says , “ Honor your father and mother. ” That is the first commandment that has a promise .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	3	“ Then things will go well with you . You will live a long time on the earth. ” ( Deuteronomy 5:16 )
NIRV	Ephesians	6	4	Fathers , don ’ t make your children angry . Instead , instruct them and teach them the ways of the Lord as you raise them .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	5	Slaves , obey your masters here on earth . Respect them and honor them with a heart that is true . Obey them just as you would obey Christ .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	7	Serve your masters with all your heart . Work as serving the Lord and not as serving people .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	8	You know that the Lord will give each person a reward . He will give to them in keeping with the good they do . It doesn ’ t matter whether they are a slave or not .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	9	Masters , treat your slaves in the same way . When you warn them , don ’ t be too hard on them . You know that the God who is their Master and yours is in heaven . And he treats everyone the same . God ’ s Armor for Believers
NIRV	Ephesians	6	10	Finally , let the Lord make you strong . Depend on his mighty power .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	11	Put on all of God ’ s armor . Then you can remain strong against the devil ’ s evil plans .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	12	Our fight is not against human beings . It is against the rulers , the authorities and the powers of this dark world . It is against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly world .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	13	So put on all of God ’ s armor . Evil days will come . But you will be able to stand up to anything . And after you have done everything you can , you will still be standing .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	14	So remain strong in the faith . Put the belt of truth around your waist . Put the armor of godliness on your chest .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	15	Wear on your feet what will prepare you to tell the good news of peace .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	16	Also , pick up the shield of faith . With it you can put out all the flaming arrows of the evil one .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	17	Put on the helmet of salvation . And take the sword of the Holy Spirit . The sword is God ’ s word .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	18	At all times , pray by the power of the Spirit . Pray all kinds of prayers . Be watchful , so that you can pray . Always keep on praying for all the Lord ’ s people .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	19	Pray also for me . Pray that whenever I speak , the right words will be given to me . Then I can be bold as I tell the mystery of the good news .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	20	Because of the good news , I am being held by chains as the Lord ’ s messenger . So pray that I will be bold as I preach the good news . That ’ s what I should do . Final Greetings
NIRV	Ephesians	6	21	Tychicus is a dear brother . He is faithful in serving the Lord . He will tell you everything about me . Then you will know how I am and what I am doing .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	22	That ’ s why I am sending him to you . I want you to know how we are . And I want him to encourage you .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	23	May God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give peace to the brothers and sisters . May they also give the believers love and faith .
NIRV	Ephesians	6	24	May grace be given to everyone who loves our Lord Jesus Christ with a love that will never die . Copyright ©

NIRV	Philippians	1	1	We , Paul and Timothy , are writing this letter . We serve Christ Jesus . We are sending this letter to you , all God ’ s holy people in Philippi . You belong to Christ Jesus . We are also sending this letter to your leaders and deacons .
NIRV	Philippians	1	2	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace . Paul Prays and Gives Thanks
NIRV	Philippians	1	3	I thank my God every time I remember you .
NIRV	Philippians	1	4	In all my prayers for all of you , I always pray with joy .
NIRV	Philippians	1	5	I am happy because you have joined me in spreading the good news . You have done so from the first day until now .
NIRV	Philippians	1	6	God began a good work in you . And I am sure that he will carry it on until it is completed . That will be on the day Christ Jesus returns .
NIRV	Philippians	1	7	It is right for me to feel this way about all of you . I love you with all my heart . I may be held by chains , or I may be standing up for the truth of the good news . Either way , all of you share in God ’ s grace together with me .
NIRV	Philippians	1	8	God is my witness that I long for all of you . I love you with the love that Christ Jesus gives .
NIRV	Philippians	1	9	I pray that your love will grow more and more . And let it be based on knowledge and understanding .
NIRV	Philippians	1	10	Then you will be able to know what is best . Then you will be pure and without blame for the day that Christ returns .
NIRV	Philippians	1	11	You will be filled with the fruit of right living produced by Jesus Christ . All these things bring glory and praise to God . Paul Spreads the Good News While in Prison
NIRV	Philippians	1	12	Brothers and sisters , here is what I want you to know . What has happened to me has actually helped to spread the good news .
NIRV	Philippians	1	13	One thing has become clear . I am being held by chains because I am a witness for Christ . All the palace guards and everyone else know it .
NIRV	Philippians	1	14	And because I am a prisoner , most of the believers have become bolder in the Lord . They now dare even more to preach the good news without fear .
NIRV	Philippians	1	15	It ’ s true that some preach about Christ because they are jealous . But others preach about Christ to help me in my work .
NIRV	Philippians	1	16	The last group acts out of love . They know I have been put here to be a witness for the good news .
NIRV	Philippians	1	17	But the others preach about Christ only to get ahead . They preach Christ for the wrong reasons . They think they can stir up trouble for me while I am being held by chains .
NIRV	Philippians	1	18	But what does it matter ? Here is the important thing . Whether for right or wrong reasons , Christ is being preached about . That makes me very glad . And I will continue to be glad .
NIRV	Philippians	1	19	I know that you are praying for me . I also know that God will give me the Spirit of Jesus Christ to help me . So no matter what happens , I ’ m sure I will still be set free .
NIRV	Philippians	1	20	I completely expect and hope that I won ’ t be ashamed in any way . I ’ m sure I will be brave enough . Now as always Christ will receive glory because of what happens to me . He will receive glory whether I live or die .
NIRV	Philippians	1	21	For me , life finds all its meaning in Christ . Death also has its benefits .
NIRV	Philippians	1	22	Suppose I go on living in my body . Then I will be able to carry on my work . It will bear a lot of fruit . But what should I choose ? I don ’ t know !
NIRV	Philippians	1	23	I can ’ t decide between the two . I long to leave this world and be with Christ . That is better by far .
NIRV	Philippians	1	24	But it is more important for you that I stay alive .
NIRV	Philippians	1	25	I ’ m sure of this . So I know I will remain with you . And I will continue with all of you to help you grow in your faith . I will also continue to help you be joyful in what you have been taught .
NIRV	Philippians	1	26	I ’ m sure I will be with you again . Then you will be able to boast in Christ Jesus even more because of me . Living to Honor the Good News
NIRV	Philippians	1	27	No matter what happens , live in a way that brings honor to the good news about Christ . Then I will know that you remain strong together in the one Spirit . I will know this if I come and see you or only hear about you . I will know that you work together as one person . I will know that you work to spread the teachings about the good news .
NIRV	Philippians	1	28	So don ’ t be afraid in any way of those who oppose you . This will show them that they will be destroyed and that you will be saved . That ’ s what God will do .
NIRV	Philippians	1	29	Here is what he has given you to do for Christ . You must not only believe in him . You must also suffer for him .
NIRV	Philippians	1	30	You are going through the same struggle you saw me go through . As you have heard , I am still struggling . Copyright ©

NIRV	Philippians	2	2	If any of these things has happened to you , then agree with one another . Have the same love . Be one in spirit and in the way you think and act . By doing this , you will make my joy complete .
NIRV	Philippians	2	3	Don ’ t do anything only to get ahead . Don ’ t do it because you are proud . Instead , be humble . Value others more than yourselves .
NIRV	Philippians	2	4	None of you should look out just for your own good . Each of you should also look out for the good of others .
NIRV	Philippians	2	5	As you deal with one another , you should think and act as Jesus did .
NIRV	Philippians	2	6	In his very nature he was God . Jesus was equal with God . But Jesus didn ’ t take advantage of that fact .
NIRV	Philippians	2	7	Instead , he made himself nothing . He did this by taking on the nature of a servant . He was made just like human beings .
NIRV	Philippians	2	8	He appeared as a man . He was humble and obeyed God completely . He did this even though it led to his death . Even worse , he died on a cross !
NIRV	Philippians	2	9	So God lifted him up to the highest place . God gave him the name that is above every name .
NIRV	Philippians	2	10	When the name of Jesus is spoken , everyone will kneel down to worship him . Everyone in heaven and on earth and under the earth will kneel down to worship him .
NIRV	Philippians	2	11	Everyone ’ s mouth will say that Jesus Christ is Lord . And God the Father will receive the glory . Live Without Complaining
NIRV	Philippians	2	12	My dear friends , you have always obeyed God . You obeyed while I was with you . And you have obeyed even more while I am not with you . So continue to work out your own salvation . Do it with fear and trembling .
NIRV	Philippians	2	13	God is working in you . He wants your plans and your acts to fulfill his good purpose .
NIRV	Philippians	2	14	Do everything without complaining or arguing .
NIRV	Philippians	2	15	Then you will be pure and without blame . You will be children of God without fault among sinful and evil people . Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky .
NIRV	Philippians	2	16	You will shine as you hold on tight to the word of life . Then I will be able to boast about you on the day Christ returns . I can be happy that I didn ’ t run or work for nothing .
NIRV	Philippians	2	17	But my life might even be poured out like a drink offering on your sacrifices . I ’ m talking about the way you serve because you believe . Even so , I am glad . I am joyful with all of you .
NIRV	Philippians	2	18	So you too should be glad and joyful with me . Timothy and Epaphroditus
NIRV	Philippians	2	19	I hope to send Timothy to you soon if the Lord Jesus allows it . Then I will be encouraged when I receive news about you .
NIRV	Philippians	2	20	I have no one else like Timothy . He will truly care about how you are doing .
NIRV	Philippians	2	21	All the others are looking out for their own interests . They are not looking out for the interests of Jesus Christ .
NIRV	Philippians	2	22	But you know that Timothy has proved himself . He has served with me like a son with his father in spreading the good news .
NIRV	Philippians	2	23	So I hope to send him as soon as I see how things go with me .
NIRV	Philippians	2	24	And I ’ m sure I myself will come soon if the Lord allows it .
NIRV	Philippians	2	25	But I think it ’ s necessary to send Epaphroditus back to you . He is my brother in the Lord . He is a worker and a soldier of Christ together with me . He is also your messenger . You sent him to take care of my needs .
NIRV	Philippians	2	26	He longs for all of you . He is troubled because you heard he was sick .
NIRV	Philippians	2	27	He was very sick . In fact , he almost died . But God had mercy on him . He also had mercy on me . God spared me sadness after sadness .
NIRV	Philippians	2	28	So I want even more to send him to you . Then when you see him again , you will be glad . And I won ’ t worry so much .
NIRV	Philippians	2	29	So then , welcome him as a brother in the Lord with great joy . Honor people like him .
NIRV	Philippians	2	30	He almost died for the work of Christ . He put his life in danger to make up for the help you yourselves couldn ’ t give me . Copyright ©

NIRV	Philippians	3	3	But we have been truly circumcised . We serve God by the power of his Spirit . We boast about what Christ Jesus has done . We don ’ t put our trust in who we are or what we can do .
NIRV	Philippians	3	2	Watch out for those dogs . They are people who do evil things . When they circumcise , it is nothing more than a useless cutting of the body .
NIRV	Philippians	3	4	I have many reasons to trust in who I am and what I have done . Someone else may think they have reasons to trust in these things . But I have even more .
NIRV	Philippians	3	5	I was circumcised on the eighth day . I am part of the people of Israel . I am from the tribe of Benjamin . I am a pure Hebrew . As far as the law is concerned , I am a Pharisee .
NIRV	Philippians	3	6	As far as being committed is concerned , I opposed and attacked the church . As far as keeping the law is concerned , I kept it perfectly .
NIRV	Philippians	3	7	I thought things like that were really something great . But now I consider them to be nothing because of Christ .
NIRV	Philippians	3	8	Even more , I consider everything to be nothing compared to knowing Christ Jesus my Lord . To know him is worth much more than anything else . Because of him I have lost everything . But I consider all of it to be garbage so I can know Christ better .
NIRV	Philippians	3	9	I want to be joined to him . Being right with God does not come from my obeying the law . It comes because I believe in Christ . It comes from God because of faith .
NIRV	Philippians	3	10	I want to know Christ better . Yes , I want to know the power that raised him from the dead . I want to join him in his sufferings . I want to become like him by sharing in his death .
NIRV	Philippians	3	11	Then by God ’ s grace I will rise from the dead .
NIRV	Philippians	3	12	I have not yet received all these things . I have not yet reached my goal . Christ Jesus took hold of me so that I could reach that goal . So I keep pushing myself forward to reach it .
NIRV	Philippians	3	13	Brothers and sisters , I don ’ t consider that I have taken hold of it yet . But here is the one thing I do . I forget what is behind me . I push hard toward what is ahead of me .
NIRV	Philippians	3	14	I push myself forward toward the goal to win the prize . God has appointed me to win it . The heavenly prize is Christ Jesus himself . Following Paul ’ s Example
NIRV	Philippians	3	15	So all of us who are grown up in the faith should see things this way . Maybe you think differently about something . But God will make it clear to you .
NIRV	Philippians	3	16	Only let us live up to what we have already reached .
NIRV	Philippians	3	17	Brothers and sisters , join together in following my example . You have us as a model . So pay close attention to those who live as we do .
NIRV	Philippians	3	18	I have told you these things many times before . Now I tell you again with tears in my eyes . Many people live like enemies of the cross of Christ .
NIRV	Philippians	3	19	The only thing they have coming to them is death . Their stomach is their god . They brag about what they should be ashamed of . They think only about earthly things .
NIRV	Philippians	3	20	But we are citizens of heaven . And we can hardly wait for a Savior from there . He is the Lord Jesus Christ .
NIRV	Philippians	3	21	He has the power to bring everything under his control . By his power he will change our earthly bodies . They will become like his glorious body . Copyright ©

NIRV	Philippians	4	4	Always be joyful because you belong to the Lord . I will say it again . Be joyful !
NIRV	Philippians	4	2	Here is what I ’ m asking Euodia and Syntyche to do . I ’ m asking them to work together in the Lord . That ’ s because they both belong to the Lord .
NIRV	Philippians	4	3	My true companion , here is what I ask you to do . Help these women , because they have served at my side . They have worked with me to spread the good news . So have Clement and the rest of those who have worked together with me . Their names are all written in the book of life . Final Commands
NIRV	Philippians	4	5	Let everyone know how gentle you are . The Lord is coming soon .
NIRV	Philippians	4	6	Don ’ t worry about anything . No matter what happens , tell God about everything . Ask and pray , and give thanks to him .
NIRV	Philippians	4	7	Then God ’ s peace will watch over your hearts and your minds . He will do this because you belong to Christ Jesus . God ’ s peace can never be completely understood .
NIRV	Philippians	4	8	Finally , my brothers and sisters , always think about what is true . Think about what is noble , right and pure . Think about what is lovely and worthy of respect . If anything is excellent or worthy of praise , think about those kinds of things .
NIRV	Philippians	4	9	Do what you have learned or received or heard from me . Follow my example . The God who gives peace will be with you . Paul Gives Thanks for the Philippians ’ Gifts
NIRV	Philippians	4	10	At last you are concerned about me again . That makes me very happy . We belong to the Lord . I know that you were concerned . But you had no chance to show it .
NIRV	Philippians	4	11	I ’ m not saying this because I need anything . I have learned to be content no matter what happens to me .
NIRV	Philippians	4	12	I know what it ’ s like not to have what I need . I also know what it ’ s like to have more than I need . I have learned the secret of being content no matter what happens . I am content whether I am well fed or hungry . I am content whether I have more than enough or not enough .
NIRV	Philippians	4	13	I can do all this by the power of Christ . He gives me strength .
NIRV	Philippians	4	14	But it was good of you to share in my troubles .
NIRV	Philippians	4	15	And you believers at Philippi know what happened when I left Macedonia . Not one church helped me in the matter of giving and receiving . You were the only one that did . That was in the early days when you first heard the good news .
NIRV	Philippians	4	16	Even when I was in Thessalonica , you sent me help when I needed it . And you did it more than once .
NIRV	Philippians	4	17	It is not that I want your gifts . What I really want is what is best for you .
NIRV	Philippians	4	18	I have received my full pay and have more than enough . I have everything I need . That ’ s because Epaphroditus brought me the gifts you sent . They are a sweet-smelling offering . They are a gift that God accepts . He is pleased with it .
NIRV	Philippians	4	19	My God will meet all your needs . He will meet them in keeping with his wonderful riches . These riches come to you because you belong to Christ Jesus .

NIRV	Colossians	1	1	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I am an apostle of Christ Jesus just as God planned . Our brother Timothy joins me in writing .
NIRV	Colossians	1	2	We are sending this letter to you , our brothers and sisters in Colossae . You belong to Christ . You are holy and faithful . May God our Father give you grace and peace . Paul Prays and Gives Thanks
NIRV	Colossians	1	3	We always thank God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , when we pray for you .
NIRV	Colossians	1	4	We thank him because we have heard about your faith in Christ Jesus . We have also heard that you love all God ’ s people .
NIRV	Colossians	1	5	Your faith and love are based on the hope you have . What you hope for is stored up for you in heaven . You have already heard about it . You were told about it when the true message was given to you . I ’ m talking about the good news
NIRV	Colossians	1	6	that has come to you . In the same way , the good news is bearing fruit . It is bearing fruit and growing all over the world . It has been doing that among you since the day you heard it . That is when you really understood God ’ s grace .
NIRV	Colossians	1	7	You learned the good news from Epaphras . He is dear to us . He serves Christ together with us . He faithfully works for Christ and for us among you .
NIRV	Colossians	1	8	He also told us about your love that comes from the Holy Spirit .
NIRV	Colossians	1	9	That ’ s why we have not stopped praying for you . We have been praying for you since the day we heard about you . We keep asking God to fill you with the knowledge of what he wants . We pray he will give you the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives .
NIRV	Colossians	1	10	Then you will be able to lead a life that is worthy of the Lord . We pray that you will please him in every way . So we want you to bear fruit in every good thing you do . We pray that you will grow to know God better .
NIRV	Colossians	1	11	We want you to be very strong , in keeping with his glorious power . We want you to be patient . We pray that you will never give up .
NIRV	Colossians	1	12	We want you to give thanks with joy to the Father . He has made you fit to have what he will give to all his holy people . You will all receive a share in the kingdom of light .
NIRV	Colossians	1	13	He has saved us from the kingdom of darkness . He has brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves .
NIRV	Colossians	1	14	Because of what the Son has done , we have been set free . Because of him , all our sins have been forgiven . The Son of God Is Better Than Everything Else
NIRV	Colossians	1	15	The Son is the exact likeness of God , who can ’ t be seen . The Son is first , and he is over all creation .
NIRV	Colossians	1	16	All things were created in him . He created everything in heaven and on earth . He created everything that can be seen and everything that can ’ t be seen . He created kings , powers , rulers and authorities . All things have been created by him and for him .
NIRV	Colossians	1	17	Before anything was created , he was already there . He holds everything together .
NIRV	Colossians	1	18	And he is the head of the body , which is the church . He is the beginning . He is the first to be raised from the dead . That happened so that he would be far above everything .
NIRV	Colossians	1	19	God was pleased to have his whole nature living in Christ .
NIRV	Colossians	1	20	God was pleased to bring all things back to himself . That ’ s because of what Christ has done . These things include everything on earth and in heaven . God made peace through Christ ’ s blood , by his death on the cross .
NIRV	Colossians	1	21	At one time you were separated from God . You were enemies in your minds because of your evil ways .
NIRV	Colossians	1	22	But because Christ died , God has brought you back to himself . Christ ’ s death has made you holy in God ’ s sight . So now you don ’ t have any flaw . You are free from blame .
NIRV	Colossians	1	23	But you must keep your faith steady and firm . You must not move away from the hope the good news holds out to you . This is the good news that you heard . It has been preached to every creature under heaven . I , Paul , now serve the good news . Paul ’ s Work for the Church
NIRV	Colossians	1	24	I am happy because of what I am suffering for you . My suffering joins with and continues the sufferings of Christ . I suffer for his body , which is the church .
NIRV	Colossians	1	25	I serve the church . God appointed me to bring the complete word of God to you .
NIRV	Colossians	1	26	That word contains the mystery that has been hidden for many ages . But now it has been made known to the Lord ’ s people .
NIRV	Colossians	1	27	God has chosen to make known to them the glorious riches of that mystery . He has made it known among the Gentiles . And here is what it is . Christ is in you . He is your hope of glory .
NIRV	Colossians	1	28	Christ is the one we preach about . With all the wisdom we have , we warn and teach everyone . When we bring them to God , we want them to be like Christ . We want them to be grown up as people who belong to Christ .
NIRV	Colossians	1	29	That ’ s what I ’ m working for . I work hard with all the strength of Christ . His strength works powerfully in me . Copyright ©

NIRV	Colossians	2	2	My goal is that their hearts may be encouraged and strengthened . I want them to be joined together in love . Then their understanding will be rich and complete . They will know the mystery of God . That mystery is Christ .
NIRV	Colossians	2	3	All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in him .
NIRV	Colossians	2	4	But I don ’ t want anyone to fool you with words that only sound good .
NIRV	Colossians	2	5	So even though I am away from you in body , I am with you in spirit . And I am glad to see that you are controlling yourselves . I am happy that your faith in Christ is so strong . Having All Things in Christ
NIRV	Colossians	2	6	You received Christ Jesus as Lord . So keep on living your lives in him .
NIRV	Colossians	2	7	Have your roots in him . Build yourselves up in him . Grow strong in what you believe , just as you were taught . Be more thankful than ever before .
NIRV	Colossians	2	8	Make sure no one controls you . They will try to control you by using false reasoning that has no meaning . Their ideas depend on human teachings . They also depend on the basic spiritual powers of this world . They don ’ t depend on Christ .
NIRV	Colossians	2	9	God ’ s whole nature is living in Christ in human form .
NIRV	Colossians	2	10	Because you belong to Christ , you have been made complete . He is the ruler over every power and authority .
NIRV	Colossians	2	11	When you received Christ , your circumcision was not done by human hands . Instead , your circumcision was done by Christ . He put away the person you used to be . At that time , sin ’ s power ruled over you .
NIRV	Colossians	2	12	When you were baptized , you were buried together with Christ . And you were raised to life together with him when you were baptized . You were raised to life by believing in God ’ s work . God himself raised Jesus from the dead .
NIRV	Colossians	2	13	At one time you were dead in your sins . Your desires controlled by sin were not circumcised . But God gave you new life together with Christ . He forgave us all our sins .
NIRV	Colossians	2	14	He wiped out what the law said that we owed . The law stood against us . It judged us . But he has taken it away and nailed it to the cross .
NIRV	Colossians	2	15	He took away the weapons of the powers and authorities . He made a public show of them . He won the battle over them by dying on the cross . Freedom From Human Rules
NIRV	Colossians	2	16	So don ’ t let anyone judge you because of what you eat or drink . Don ’ t let anyone judge you about holy days . I ’ m talking about special feasts and New Moons and Sabbath days .
NIRV	Colossians	2	17	They are only a shadow of the things to come . But what is real is found in Christ .
NIRV	Colossians	2	18	Some people enjoy pretending they aren ’ t proud . They worship angels . But don ’ t let people like that judge you . These people tell you every little thing about what they have seen . They are proud of their useless ideas . That ’ s because their minds are not guided by the Holy Spirit .
NIRV	Colossians	2	19	They aren ’ t connected anymore to the head , who is Christ . But the whole body grows from the head . The muscles and tendons hold the body together . And God causes it to grow .
NIRV	Colossians	2	20	Some people still follow the basic spiritual powers of the world . But you died with Christ as far as these powers are concerned . So why do you act as if you still belong to the world ? Here are the rules you follow .
NIRV	Colossians	2	21	“ Do not handle ! Do not taste ! Do not touch ! ”
NIRV	Colossians	2	22	Rules like these are about things that will pass away soon . They are based on merely human rules and teachings .
NIRV	Colossians	2	23	It is true that these rules seem wise . Because of them , people give themselves over to their own kind of worship . They pretend they are humble . They treat their bodies very badly . But rules like these don ’ t help . They don ’ t stop people from chasing after sinful pleasures . Copyright ©

NIRV	Colossians	3	3	You died . Now your life is hidden with Christ in God .
NIRV	Colossians	3	2	Think about things that are in heaven . Don ’ t think about things that are only on earth .
NIRV	Colossians	3	4	Christ is your life . When he appears again , you also will appear with him in heaven ’ s glory .
NIRV	Colossians	3	5	So put to death anything that comes from sinful desires . Get rid of sexual sins and impure acts . Don ’ t let your feelings get out of control . Remove from your life all evil desires . Stop always wanting more and more . You might as well be worshiping statues of gods .
NIRV	Colossians	3	6	God ’ s anger is going to come because of these things .
NIRV	Colossians	3	7	That ’ s the way you lived at one time in your life .
NIRV	Colossians	3	8	But now here are the kinds of things you must also get rid of . You must get rid of anger , rage , hate and lies . Let no dirty words come out of your mouths .
NIRV	Colossians	3	9	Don ’ t lie to one another . You have gotten rid of your old way of life and its habits .
NIRV	Colossians	3	10	You have started living a new life . Your knowledge of how that life should have the Creator ’ s likeness is being made new .
NIRV	Colossians	3	11	Here there is no Gentile or Jew . There is no difference between those who are circumcised and those who are not . There is no rude outsider , or even a Scythian . There is no slave or free person . But Christ is everything . And he is in everything .
NIRV	Colossians	3	12	You are God ’ s chosen people . You are holy and dearly loved . So put on tender mercy and kindness as if they were your clothes . Don ’ t be proud . Be gentle and patient .
NIRV	Colossians	3	13	Put up with one another . Forgive one another if you are holding something against someone . Forgive , just as the Lord forgave you .
NIRV	Colossians	3	14	And over all these good things put on love . Love holds them all together perfectly as if they were one .
NIRV	Colossians	3	15	Let the peace that Christ gives rule in your hearts . As parts of one body , you were appointed to live in peace . And be thankful .
NIRV	Colossians	3	16	Let the message about Christ live among you like a rich treasure . Teach and correct one another wisely . Teach one another by singing psalms and hymns and songs from the Spirit . Sing to God with thanks in your hearts .
NIRV	Colossians	3	17	Do everything you say or do in the name of the Lord Jesus . Always give thanks to God the Father through Christ . Teachings About Christian Families
NIRV	Colossians	3	18	Wives , follow the lead of your husbands . That ’ s what the Lord wants you to do .
NIRV	Colossians	3	19	Husbands , love your wives . Don ’ t be mean to them .
NIRV	Colossians	3	20	Children , obey your parents in everything . That pleases the Lord .
NIRV	Colossians	3	21	Fathers , don ’ t make your children bitter . If you do , they will lose hope .
NIRV	Colossians	3	22	Slaves , obey your earthly masters in everything . Don ’ t do it just to please them when they are watching you . Obey them with an honest heart . Do it out of respect for the Lord .
NIRV	Colossians	3	23	Work at everything you do with all your heart . Work as if you were working for the Lord , not for human masters .
NIRV	Colossians	3	24	Work because you know that you will finally receive as a reward what the Lord wants you to have . You are slaves of the Lord Christ .
NIRV	Colossians	3	25	Anyone who does wrong will be paid back for what they do . God treats everyone the same . Copyright ©

NIRV	Colossians	4	2	Give a lot of time and effort to prayer . Always be watchful and thankful .
NIRV	Colossians	4	3	Pray for us too . Pray that God will give us an opportunity to preach our message . Then we can preach the mystery of Christ . Because I preached it , I am being held by chains .
NIRV	Colossians	4	5	Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders . Make the most of every opportunity .
NIRV	Colossians	4	6	Let the words you speak always be full of grace . Learn how to make your words what people want to hear . Then you will know how to answer everyone . Final Greetings

You belong to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . May grace and peace be given to you . Paul Gives Thanks for the Thessalonians ’ Faith
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	1	2	We always thank God for all of you . We keep on praying for you .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	1	3	We remember you when we pray to our God and Father . Your work is produced by your faith . Your service is the result of your love . Your strength to continue comes from your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	1	4	Brothers and sisters , you are loved by God . We know that he has chosen you .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	1	5	Our good news didn ’ t come to you only in words . It came with power . It came with the Holy Spirit ’ s help . He gave us complete faith in what we were preaching . You know how we lived among you for your good .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	1	6	We and the Lord were your examples . You followed us . You welcomed our message even when you were suffering terribly . You welcomed it with the joy the Holy Spirit gives .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	1	7	So you became a model to all the believers in the lands of Macedonia and Achaia .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	1	8	The Lord ’ s message rang out from you . That was true not only in Macedonia and Achaia . Your faith in God has also become known everywhere . So we don ’ t have to say anything about it .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	1	9	The believers themselves report the kind of welcome you gave us . They tell about how you turned away from statues of gods . And you turned to serve the living and true God .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	1	10	They tell about how you are waiting for his Son to come from heaven . God raised him from the dead . He is Jesus . He saves us from God ’ s anger , and his anger is sure to come . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	1	Thessalonians
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	2	You know what happened earlier in the city of Philippi . We suffered , and people treated us very badly there . But God gave us the boldness to tell you his good news . We preached to you even when people strongly opposed us .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	3	The appeal we make is based on truth . It comes from a pure heart . We are not trying to trick you .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	4	In fact , it is just the opposite . God has approved us to preach . He has trusted us with the good news . We aren ’ t trying to please people . We want to please God . He tests our hearts .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	5	As you know , we never praised you if we didn ’ t mean it . We didn ’ t put on a mask to cover up any sinful desire . God is our witness that this is true .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	6	We were not expecting people to praise us . We were not looking for praise from you or anyone else . Yet as Christ ’ s apostles , we could have used our authority over you .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	7	Instead , we were like young children when we were with you . As a mother feeds and cares for her little children ,
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	8	we cared for you . We loved you so much . So we were happy to share with you God ’ s good news . We were also happy to share our lives with you .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	9	Brothers and sisters , I am sure you remember how hard we worked . We labored night and day while we preached to you God ’ s good news . We didn ’ t want to cause you any expense .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	10	You are witnesses of how we lived among you believers . God is also a witness that we were holy and godly and without blame .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	11	You know that we treated each of you as a father treats his own children .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	12	We gave you hope and strength . We comforted you . We really wanted you to live in a way that is worthy of God . He chooses you to enter his glorious kingdom .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	13	We never stop thanking God for the way you received his word . You heard it from us . But you didn ’ t accept it as a human word . You accepted it for what it really is . It is God ’ s word . It is really at work in you who believe .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	Brothers and sisters , you became like the members of God ’ s churches in Judea . They are believers in Christ Jesus , just as you are . Your own people made you suffer . You went through the same things the church members in Judea suffered from the Jews .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	15	The Jews who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets also forced us to leave . They do not please God . They are enemies of everyone .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	16	They try to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles . These Jews don ’ t want the Gentiles to be saved . In this way , these Jews always increase their sins to the limit . God ’ s anger has come on them at last . Paul Wants to See the Believers in Thessalonica
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	17	Brothers and sisters , we were separated from you for a short time . Apart from you , we were like children without parents . We were no longer with you in person . But we kept you in our thoughts . We really wanted to see you . So we tried very hard to do so .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	18	We wanted to come to you . Again and again I , Paul , wanted to come . But Satan blocked our way .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	19	What is our hope ? What is our joy ? When our Lord Jesus returns , what is the crown we will delight in ? Isn ’ t it you ?
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	2	20	Yes , you are our glory and our joy . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	3	3	We sent him so that no one would be upset by times of testing . You know very well that we have to go through times of testing .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	3	2	We sent our brother Timothy to give you strength and hope in your faith . He works together with us in God ’ s service to spread the good news about Christ .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	3	4	In fact , when we were with you , here is what we kept telling you . We were telling you that our enemies would make us suffer . As you know very well , it has turned out that way .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	3	5	That ’ s the reason I sent someone to find out about your faith . I couldn ’ t wait any longer . I was afraid that Satan had tempted you in some way . Then our work among you would have been useless . Timothy Brings a Good Report
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	3	6	But Timothy has come to us from you just now . He has brought good news about your faith and love . He has told us that you always have happy memories of us . He has also said that you desire to see us , just as we desire to see you .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	3	7	Brothers and sisters , in all our trouble and suffering your faith encouraged us .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	3	8	Now we really live , because you are standing firm in the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	3	9	How can we thank God enough for you ? We thank God because of all the joy we have in his presence . We have this joy because of you .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	3	10	Night and day we pray very hard that we will see you again . We want to give you what is missing in your faith .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	3	11	Now may a way be opened up for us to come to you . May our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus do this .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	3	12	May the Lord make your love grow . May it be like a rising flood . May your love for one another increase . May it also increase for everyone else . May it be just like our love for you .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	3	13	May the Lord give you strength in your hearts . Then you will be holy and without blame in the sight of our God and Father . May that be true when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	4	4	He wants all of you to learn to control your own bodies . You must live in a way that is holy . You must live with honor .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	4	2	You know the directions we gave you . They were given by the authority of the Lord Jesus .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	4	3	God wants you to be made holy . He wants you to stay away from sexual sins .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	4	5	Don ’ t desire to commit sexual sins like people who don ’ t know God .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	4	6	None of you should sin against your brother or sister by doing that . You should not take advantage of your brother or sister . The Lord will punish everyone who commits these kinds of sins . We have already told you and warned you about this .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	4	7	That ’ s because God chose us to live pure lives . He wants us to be holy .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	4	8	Suppose someone refuses to accept our teaching . They are not turning their back on us . They are turning their back on God . This same God gives you his Holy Spirit .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	4	9	We don ’ t need to write to you about your love for one another . God himself has taught you to love one another .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	4	10	In fact , you do love all God ’ s family all around Macedonia . Brothers and sisters , we are asking you to love one another more and more .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	4	11	And do everything you can to live a quiet life . You should mind your own business . And work with your hands , just as we told you to .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	4	12	Then unbelievers will have respect for your everyday life . And you won ’ t have to depend on anyone . What Happens to Believers Who Have Died
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	4	13	Brothers and sisters , we want you to know what happens to those who die . We don ’ t want you to mourn , as other people do . They mourn because they don ’ t have any hope .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	4	14	We believe that Jesus died and rose again . When he returns , many who believe in him will have died already . We believe that God will bring them back with Jesus .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	4	15	This agrees with what the Lord has said . When the Lord comes , many of us will still be alive . We tell you that we will certainly not go up before those who have died .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	4	16	The Lord himself will come down from heaven . We will hear a loud command . We will hear the voice of the leader of the angels . We will hear a blast from God ’ s trumpet . Many who believe in Christ will have died already . They will rise first .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	4	17	After that , we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them . We will be taken up in the clouds . We will meet the Lord in the air . And we will be with him forever .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	4	18	So encourage one another with these words of comfort . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	5	All of you are children of the light . You are children of the day . We don ’ t belong to the night . We don ’ t belong to the darkness .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	2	You know very well how the day of the Lord will come . It will come like a thief in the night .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	3	People will be saying that everything is peaceful and safe . Then suddenly they will be destroyed . It will happen like birth pains coming on a pregnant woman . None of the people will escape .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	4	Brothers and sisters , you are not in darkness . So that day should not surprise you as a thief would .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	6	So let us not be like the others . They are asleep . Instead , let us be wide awake and in full control of ourselves .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	7	Those who sleep , sleep at night . Those who get drunk , get drunk at night .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	8	But we belong to the day . So let us control ourselves . Let us put on our chest the armor of faith and love . Let us put on the hope of salvation like a helmet .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	9	God didn ’ t choose us to receive his anger . He chose us to receive salvation because of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	10	Jesus died for us . Some will be alive when he comes . Others will be dead . Either way , we will live together with him .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	11	So encourage one another with the hope you have . Build each other up . In fact , that ’ s what you are doing . Final Teachings
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	12	Brothers and sisters , we ask you to accept the godly leaders who work hard among you . They care for you in the Lord . They correct you .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	13	Have a lot of respect for them . Love them because of what they do . Live in peace with one another .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	14	Brothers and sisters , we are asking you to warn certain people . These people don ’ t want to work . Instead , they make trouble . We are also asking you to encourage those who have lost hope . Help those who are weak . Be patient with everyone .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	15	Make sure that no one pays back one wrong act with another . Instead , always try to do what is good for each other and for everyone else .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	16	Always be joyful .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	17	Never stop praying .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	18	Give thanks no matter what happens . God wants you to thank him because you believe in Christ Jesus .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	19	Don ’ t try to stop what the Holy Spirit is doing .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	20	Don ’ t treat prophecies as if they weren ’ t important .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	21	But test all prophecies . Hold on to what is good .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	22	Say no to every kind of evil .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	23	God is the God who gives peace . May he make you holy through and through . May your whole spirit , soul and body be kept free from blame . May you be without blame from now until our Lord Jesus Christ comes .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	24	The God who has chosen you is faithful . He will do all these things .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	25	Brothers and sisters , pray for us .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	26	Greet all God ’ s people with a holy kiss .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	27	While the Lord is watching , here is what I command you . Have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters .
NIRV	1%20Thessalonians	5	28	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	1	2	May God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace . Paul Prays and Gives Thanks
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	1	1	I , Paul , am writing this letter . Silas and Timothy join me in writing . We are sending this letter to you , the members of the church in Thessalonica . You belong to God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	1	3	Brothers and sisters , we should always thank God for you . That is only right , because your faith is growing more and more . We also thank God that the love you all have for one another is increasing .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	1	4	So among God ’ s churches we brag about the fact that you don ’ t give up easily . We brag about your faith in all the suffering and testing you are going through .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	1	5	All of this proves that when God judges , he is fair . So you will be considered worthy to enter God ’ s kingdom . You are suffering for his kingdom .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	1	6	God is fair . He will pay back trouble to those who give you trouble .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	1	7	He will help you who are troubled . And he will also help us . All these things will happen when the Lord Jesus appears from heaven . He will come in blazing fire . He will come with his powerful angels .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	1	8	He will punish those who don ’ t know God . He will punish those who don ’ t obey the good news about our Lord Jesus .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	1	9	They will be destroyed forever . They will be shut out of heaven . They will never see the glory of the Lord ’ s strength .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	1	10	All these things will happen when he comes . On that day his glory will be seen in his holy people . Everyone who has believed will be amazed when they see him . This includes you , because you believed the witness we gave you .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	1	11	Keeping this in mind , we never stop praying for you . Our God has chosen you . We pray that he will make you worthy of his choice . We pray he will make every good thing you want to do come true . We pray that he will do this by his power . We pray that he will make perfect all that you have done by faith .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	1	12	We pray this so that the name of our Lord Jesus will receive glory through what you have done . We also pray that you will receive glory through what he has done . We pray all these things in keeping with the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	2	2	What if you receive a message that is supposed to have come from us ? What if it says that the day of the Lord has already come ? If it does , we ask you not to become easily upset or alarmed . Don ’ t be upset whether that message is spoken or written or prophesied .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	2	3	Don ’ t let anyone trick you in any way . That day will not come until people rise up against God . It will not come until the man of sin appears . He is a marked man . He is headed for ruin .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	2	4	He will oppose everything that is called God . He will oppose everything that is worshiped . He will give himself power over everything . He will set himself up in God ’ s temple . He will announce that he himself is God .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	2	5	Don ’ t you remember ? When I was with you , I used to tell you these things .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	2	6	Now you know what is holding back the man of sin . He is held back so that he can make his appearance at the right time .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	2	7	The secret power of sin is already at work . But the one who now holds back that power will keep doing it until he is taken out of the way .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	2	8	Then the man of sin will appear . The Lord Jesus will overthrow him with the breath of his mouth . The glorious brightness of Jesus ’ coming will destroy the man of sin .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	2	9	The coming of the man of sin will fit how Satan works . The man of sin will show his power through all kinds of signs and wonders . These signs and wonders will lead people astray .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	2	10	So people who are dying will be fooled by this evil . These people are dying because they refuse to love the truth . The truth would save them .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	2	11	So God will fool them completely . Then they will believe the lie .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	2	12	Many will not believe the truth . They will take pleasure in evil . They will be judged . Remain Strong in the Faith
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	2	13	Brothers and sisters , we should always thank God for you . The Lord loves you . That ’ s because God chose you as the first to be saved . Salvation comes through the Holy Spirit ’ s work . He makes people holy . It also comes through believing the truth .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	2	14	He chose you to be saved by accepting the good news that we preach . And you will share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	2	15	Brothers and sisters , remain strong in the faith . Hold on to what we taught you . We passed our teachings on to you by what we preached and wrote .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	2	16	Our Lord Jesus Christ and God our Father loved us . By his grace God gave us comfort that will last forever . The hope he gave us is good . May our Lord Jesus Christ and God our Father
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	2	17	comfort your hearts . May they make you strong in every good thing you do and say . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	3	2	And pray that we will be saved from sinful and evil people . Not everyone is a believer .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	3	3	But the Lord is faithful . He will strengthen you . He will guard you from the evil one .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	3	4	We trust in the Lord . So we are sure that you are doing the things we tell you to do . And we are sure that you will keep on doing them .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	3	5	May the Lord fill your hearts with God ’ s love . May Christ give you the strength to go on . Paul Warns Those Who Do Not Want to Work
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	3	6	Brothers and sisters , here is a command we give you . We give it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ . Keep away from every believer who doesn ’ t want to work and makes trouble . Keep away from any believer who doesn ’ t live up to the teaching you received from us .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	3	7	You know how you should follow our example . We worked when we were with you .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	3	8	We didn ’ t eat anyone ’ s food without paying for it . In fact , it was just the opposite . We worked night and day . We worked very hard so that we wouldn ’ t cause any expense to any of you .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	3	9	We worked , even though we have the right to receive help from you . We did it in order to be a model for you to follow .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	3	10	Even when we were with you , we gave you a rule . We said , “ Anyone who won ’ t work shouldn ’ t be allowed to eat. ”
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	3	11	We hear that some people among you don ’ t want to work and are making trouble . They aren ’ t really busy . Instead , they are bothering others .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	3	12	We belong to the Lord Jesus Christ . So we strongly command people like that to settle down . They have to earn the food they eat .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	3	13	Brothers and sisters , don ’ t ever get tired of doing what is good .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	3	14	Keep an eye on anyone who doesn ’ t obey the teachings in our letter . Don ’ t have anything to do with that person . Then they will feel ashamed .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	3	15	But don ’ t think of them as an enemy . Instead , warn them as you would warn another believer . Final Greetings
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	3	16	May the Lord who gives peace give you peace at all times and in every way . May the Lord be with all of you .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	3	17	I , Paul , write this greeting in my own handwriting . That ’ s how I prove that I am the author of all my letters . I always do it that way .
NIRV	2%20Thessalonians	3	18	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	1	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I am an apostle of Christ Jesus , just as God our Savior commanded . Christ Jesus also commanded it . We have put our hope in him .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	2	Timothy , I am sending you this letter . You are my true son in the faith . May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord give you grace , mercy and peace . Paul Warns Timothy to Oppose False Teachers
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	3	Timothy , stay there in Ephesus . That is what I told you to do when I went into Macedonia . I want you to command certain people not to teach things that aren ’ t true .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	4	And command them not to spend their time on stories that are made up . They must not waste time on family histories that never end . These things only lead to fights about ideas . They don ’ t help God ’ s work move forward . His work is done by faith .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	5	Love is the purpose of my command . Love comes from a pure heart . It comes from a good sense of what is right and wrong . It comes from faith that is honest and true .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	6	Some have turned from these teachings . They would rather talk about things that have no meaning .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	7	They want to be teachers of the law . And they are very sure about that law . But they don ’ t know what they are talking about .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	8	We know that the law is good if it is used properly .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	9	We also know that the law isn ’ t made for godly people . It is made for those who break the law . It is for those who refuse to obey . It is for ungodly and sinful people . It is for those who aren ’ t holy and who don ’ t believe . It is for those who kill their fathers or mothers . It is for murderers .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	10	It is for those who commit sexual sins . It is for those who commit homosexual acts . It is for people who buy and sell slaves . It is for liars . It is for people who tell lies in court . It is for those who are a witness to things that aren ’ t true . And it is for anything else that is the opposite of true teaching .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	11	True teaching agrees with the good news about the glory of the blessed God . He trusted me with that good news . The Lord Pours Out His Grace on Paul
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	12	I am thankful to Christ Jesus our Lord . He has given me strength . I thank him that he considered me faithful . I thank him for appointing me to serve him .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	13	I used to speak evil things against Jesus . I tried to hurt his followers . I really pushed them around . But God showed me mercy anyway . I did those things without knowing any better . I wasn ’ t a believer .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	14	Our Lord poured out more and more of his grace on me . Along with it came faith and love from Christ Jesus .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	15	Here is a saying that you can trust . It should be accepted completely . Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners . And I am the worst sinner of all .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	16	But for that very reason , God showed me mercy . And I am the worst of sinners . He showed me mercy so that Christ Jesus could show that he is very patient . I was an example for those who would come to believe in him . Then they would receive eternal life .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	17	The eternal King will never die . He can ’ t be seen . He is the only God . Give him honor and glory for ever and ever . Amen . Paul Commands Timothy
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	18	My son Timothy , I am giving you this command . It is in keeping with the prophecies once made about you . By remembering them , you can fight the battle well .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	19	Then you will hold on to faith . You will hold on to a good sense of what is right and wrong . Some have not accepted this knowledge of right and wrong . So they have destroyed their faith . They are like a ship that has sunk .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	1	20	Hymenaeus and Alexander are among them . I have handed them over to Satan . That will teach them not to speak evil things against God . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Timothy	2	1	Timothy
NIRV	1%20Timothy	2	2	Pray for kings . Pray for everyone who is in authority . Pray that we can live peaceful and quiet lives . And pray that we will be godly and holy .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	2	3	This is good , and it pleases God our Savior .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	2	4	He wants all people to be saved . He wants them to come to know the truth .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	2	5	There is only one God . And there is only one go-between for God and human beings . He is the man Christ Jesus .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	2	6	He gave himself to pay for the sins of all people . We have been told this message at just the right time .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	2	7	I was appointed to be a messenger and an apostle to preach the good news . I am telling the truth . I ’ m not lying . God appointed me to be a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	2	8	So I want the men in every place to pray . I want them to lift up holy hands . I don ’ t want them to be angry when they pray . I don ’ t want them to argue .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	2	9	In the same way , I want the women to be careful how they dress . They should wear clothes that are right and proper . They shouldn ’ t wear their hair in very fancy styles . They shouldn ’ t wear gold or pearls . They shouldn ’ t wear clothes that cost a lot of money .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	2	10	Instead , they should put on good works as if good works were their clothes . This is proper for women who claim to worship God .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	2	11	When a woman is learning , she should be quiet . She should follow her leaders in every way .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	2	12	I do not let women teach or take authority over a man . They must be quiet .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	2	13	That ’ s because Adam was made first . Then Eve was made .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	2	14	Adam was not the one who was tricked . The woman was tricked and became a sinner .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	2	15	Will women be saved by having children ? Only if they keep on believing , loving , and leading a holy life in a proper way . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Timothy	3	1	Timothy
NIRV	1%20Timothy	3	3	He must not get drunk . He must not push people around . He must be gentle . He must not be a person who likes to argue . He must not love money .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	3	2	A leader must be free from blame . He must be faithful to his wife . In anything he does , he must not go too far . He must control himself . He must be worthy of respect . He must welcome people into his home . He must be able to teach .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	3	4	He must manage his own family well . He must make sure that his children obey him . And he must do this in a way that gains him respect .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	3	5	Suppose someone doesn ’ t know how to manage his own family . Then how can he take care of God ’ s church ?
NIRV	1%20Timothy	3	6	The leader must not be a new believer . If he is , he might become proud . Then he would be judged just like the devil .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	3	7	The leader must also be respected by those who are outside the church . Then he will not be put to shame . He will not fall into the devil ’ s trap .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	3	8	In the same way , deacons must be worthy of respect . They must be honest and true . They must not drink too much wine . They must not try to get money by cheating people .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	3	9	They must hold on to the deep truths of the faith . Even their own minds tell them to do that .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	3	10	First they must be tested . Then let them serve as deacons if there is nothing against them .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	3	11	In the same way , the women must be worthy of respect . They must not say things that harm others . In anything they do , they must not go too far . They must be worthy of trust in everything .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	3	12	A deacon must be faithful to his wife . He must manage his children and family well .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	3	13	Those who have served well earn the full respect of others . They also become more sure of their faith in Christ Jesus . Paul ’ s Reasons for Giving Instructions to Timothy
NIRV	1%20Timothy	3	14	I hope I can come to you soon . But now I am writing these instructions to you .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	3	15	Then if I have to put off my visit , you will know how people should act in God ’ s family . The family of God is the church of the living God . It is the pillar and foundation of the truth .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	3	16	There is no doubt that true godliness comes from this great mystery . Jesus came as a human being . The Holy Spirit proved that he was the Son of God . He was seen by angels . He was preached among the nations . People in the world believed in him . He was taken up to heaven in glory . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Timothy	4	1	Timothy
NIRV	1%20Timothy	4	4	Everything God created is good . You shouldn ’ t turn anything down . Instead , you should thank God for it .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	4	2	Teachings like those come from liars who pretend to be what they are not . Their sense of what is right and wrong has been destroyed . It ’ s as though it has been burned with a hot iron .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	4	3	They do not allow people to get married . They order them not to eat certain foods . But God created those foods . So people who believe and know the truth should receive them and give thanks for them .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	4	5	The word of God and prayer make it holy .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	4	6	Point out these things to the brothers and sisters . Then you will serve Christ Jesus well . You will show that you ’ ve grown in the truths of the faith . You will show that you ’ ve been trained by the good teaching you ’ ve obeyed .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	4	7	Don ’ t have anything to do with godless stories and silly tales . Instead , train yourself to be godly .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	4	8	Training the body has some value . But being godly has value in every way . It promises help for the life you are now living and the life to come .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	4	9	This is the truth you can trust and accept completely .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	4	10	This is why we work and try so hard . It ’ s because we have put our hope in the living God . He is the Savior of all people . Most of all , he is the Savior of those who believe .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	4	11	Command and teach these things .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	4	12	Don ’ t let anyone look down on you because you are young . Set an example for the believers in what you say and in how you live . Also set an example in how you love and in what you believe . Show the believers how to be pure .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	4	13	Until I come , spend your time reading Scripture out loud to one another . Spend your time preaching and teaching .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	4	14	Don ’ t fail to use the gift the Holy Spirit gave you . He gave it to you through a prophecy from God . It was given when the elders placed their hands on you .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	4	15	Keep on doing these things . Give them your complete attention . Then everyone will see how you are coming along .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	4	16	Be careful of how you live and what you believe . Never give up . Then you will save yourself and those who hear you . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	1	Timothy
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	5	A widow who really needs help and is left all alone puts her hope in God . Night and day she keeps on praying . Night and day she asks God for help .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	2	Treat older women as if they were your mothers . Treat younger women as if they were your sisters . Be completely pure in the way you treat them .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	3	Take care of the widows who really need help .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	4	But suppose a widow has children or grandchildren . They should first learn to put their faith into practice . They should care for their own family . In that way they will pay back their parents and grandparents . That pleases God .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	6	But a widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she is still living .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	7	Give these instructions to the people . Then no one can be blamed .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	8	Everyone should provide for their own relatives . Most of all , everyone should take care of their own family . If they don ’ t , they have left the faith . They are worse than someone who doesn ’ t believe .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	9	No widow should be put on the list of widows unless she is more than
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	60	years old . She must also have been faithful to her husband .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	10	She must be well known for the good things she does . That includes bringing up children . It includes inviting guests into her home . It includes washing the feet of the Lord ’ s people . It includes helping those who are in trouble . A widow should spend her time doing all kinds of good things .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	11	Don ’ t put younger widows on that kind of list . They might want pleasure more than they want Christ . Then they would want to get married again .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	12	If they do that , they will be judged . They have broken their first promise .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	13	Besides , they get into the habit of having nothing to do . They go around from house to house . They waste their time . They also bother other people and say things that make no sense . They shouldn ’ t say those things .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	14	So here is the advice I give to younger widows . Get married . Have children . Take care of your own homes . Don ’ t give the enemy the chance to tell lies about you .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	15	In fact , some have already turned away to follow Satan .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	16	Suppose a woman is a believer and takes care of widows . She should continue to help them . She shouldn ’ t let the church pay the expenses . Then the church can help the widows who really need it .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	17	The elders who do the church ’ s work well are worth twice as much honor . That is true in a special way of elders who preach and teach .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	18	Scripture says , “ Do not stop an ox from eating while it helps separate the grain from the straw. ” ( Deuteronomy 25:4 ) Scripture also says , “ Workers are worthy of their pay. ” ( Luke 10:7 )
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	19	Don ’ t believe a charge against an elder unless two or three witnesses bring it .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	20	But those elders who are sinning should be corrected in front of everyone . This will be a warning to the others .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	21	I command you to follow these instructions . I command you in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels . Treat everyone the same . Don ’ t favor one person over another .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	22	Don ’ t be too quick to place your hands on others to set them apart to serve God . Don ’ t take part in the sins of others . Keep yourself pure .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	23	Stop drinking only water . If your stomach is upset , drink a little wine . It can also help the other sicknesses you often have .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	24	The sins of some people are easy to see . They are already being judged . Others will be judged later .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	5	25	In the same way , good works are easy to see . But even good works that are hard to see can ’ t stay hidden forever . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	6	You gain a lot when you live a godly life . But you must be happy with what you have .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	2	Some slaves have masters who are believers . They shouldn ’ t show their masters disrespect just because they are also believers . Instead , they should serve them even better . That ’ s because their masters are loved by them as believers . These masters are committed to caring for their slaves . People Who Teach Lies or Love Money These are the things you are to teach . Try hard to get the believers to do them .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	3	Suppose someone teaches something different than I have taught . Suppose that person doesn ’ t agree with the true teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ . Suppose they don ’ t agree with godly teaching .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	4	Then that person is proud and doesn ’ t understand anything . They like to argue more than they should . They can ’ t agree about what words mean . All of this results in wanting what others have . It causes fighting , harmful talk , and evil distrust .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	5	It stirs up trouble all the time among people whose minds are twisted by sin . The truth they once had has been taken away from them . They think they can get rich by being godly .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	7	We didn ’ t bring anything into the world . We can ’ t take anything out of it .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	8	If we have food and clothing , we will be happy with that .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	9	People who want to get rich are tempted . They fall into a trap . They are tripped up by wanting many foolish and harmful things . Those who live like that are dragged down by what they do . They are destroyed and die .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	10	Love for money causes all kinds of evil . Some people want to get rich . They have wandered away from the faith . They have wounded themselves with many sorrows . Paul Gives a Final Command to Timothy
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	11	But you are a man of God . Run away from all these things . Try hard to do what is right and godly . Have faith , love and gentleness . Hold on to what you believe .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	12	Fight the good fight along with all other believers . Take hold of eternal life . You were chosen for it when you openly told others what you believe . Many witnesses heard you .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	13	God gives life to everything . Christ Jesus told the truth when he was a witness in front of Pontius Pilate . In the sight of God and Christ , I give you a command .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	14	Obey it until our Lord Jesus Christ appears . Obey it completely . Then no one can find fault with it or you .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	15	God will bring Jesus back at a time that pleases him . God is the blessed and only Ruler . He is the greatest King of all . He is the most powerful Lord of all .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	16	God is the only one who can ’ t die . He lives in light that no one can get close to . No one has seen him . No one can see him . Honor and power belong to him forever . Amen .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	17	Command people who are rich in this world not to be proud . Tell them not to put their hope in riches . Wealth is so uncertain . Command those who are rich to put their hope in God . He richly provides us with everything to enjoy .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	18	Command the rich to do what is good . Tell them to be rich in doing good things . They must give freely . They must be willing to share .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	19	In this way , they will store up true riches for themselves . It will provide a firm basis for the next life . Then they will take hold of the life that really is life .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	20	Timothy , guard what God has trusted you with . Turn away from godless chatter . Stay away from opposing ideas that are falsely called knowledge .
NIRV	1%20Timothy	6	21	Some people believe them . By doing that they have turned away from the faith . May God ’ s grace be with you all . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Timothy	1	2	Timothy , I am sending you this letter . You are my dear son . May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord give you grace , mercy and peace . Paul Gives Thanks
NIRV	2%20Timothy	1	1	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I am an apostle of Christ Jesus just as God planned . He sent me to tell about the promise of life found in Christ Jesus .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	1	3	I thank God , whom I serve as did our people of long ago . I serve God , knowing that what I have done is right . Night and day I thank God for you . Night and day I always remember you in my prayers .

NIRV	2%20Timothy	1	7	God gave us his Spirit . And the Spirit doesn ’ t make us weak and fearful . Instead , the Spirit gives us power and love . He helps us control ourselves .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	1	8	So don ’ t be ashamed of the message about our Lord . And don ’ t be ashamed of me , his prisoner . Instead , join with me as I suffer for the good news . God ’ s power will help us do that .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	1	9	God has saved us . He has chosen us to live a holy life . It wasn ’ t because of anything we have done . It was because of his own purpose and grace . Through Christ Jesus , God gave us this grace even before time began .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	1	10	It has now been made known through the coming of our Savior , Christ Jesus . He has broken the power of death . Because of the good news , he has brought life out into the light . That life never dies .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	1	11	I was appointed to announce the good news . I was appointed to be an apostle and a teacher .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	1	12	That ’ s why I ’ m suffering the way I am . But this gives me no reason to be ashamed . That ’ s because I know who I have believed in . I am sure he is able to take care of what I have given him . I can trust him with it until the day he returns as judge .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	1	13	Follow what you heard from me as the pattern of true teaching . Follow it with faith and love because you belong to Christ Jesus .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	1	14	Guard the truth of the good news that you were trusted with . Guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us . Examples of Faithful and Unfaithful People
NIRV	2%20Timothy	1	15	You know that all the believers in Asia Minor have deserted me . They include Phygelus and Hermogenes .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	1	16	May the Lord show mercy to all who live in the house of Onesiphorus . He often encouraged me . He was not ashamed that I was being held by chains .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	1	17	In fact , it was just the opposite . When he was in Rome , he looked everywhere for me . At last he found me .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	1	18	May Onesiphorus find mercy from the Lord on the day Jesus returns as judge ! You know very well how many ways Onesiphorus helped me in Ephesus . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	2	You have heard me teach in front of many witnesses . Pass on to people you can trust the things you ’ ve heard me say . Then they will be able to teach others also .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	3	Like a good soldier of Christ Jesus , join with me in suffering .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	4	A soldier does not take part in things that don ’ t have anything to do with the army . Instead , he tries to please his commanding officer .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	5	It is the same for anyone who takes part in a sport . They don ’ t receive the winner ’ s crown unless they play by the rules .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	6	The farmer who works hard should be the first to receive a share of the crops .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	7	Think about what I ’ m saying . The Lord will help you understand what all of it means .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	8	Remember Jesus Christ . He came from David ’ s family line . He was raised from the dead . That is my good news .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	9	I am suffering for it . I have even been put in chains like someone who has committed a crime . But God ’ s word is not held back by chains .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	10	So I put up with everything for the good of God ’ s chosen people . Then they also can be saved . Christ Jesus saves them . He gives them glory that will last forever .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	11	Here is a saying you can trust . If we died with him , we will also live with him .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	12	If we don ’ t give up , we will also rule with him . If we say we don ’ t know him , he will also say he doesn ’ t know us .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	13	Even if we are not faithful , he remains faithful . He must be true to himself . What to Do About False Teachers
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	14	Keep reminding God ’ s people of these things . While God is watching , warn them not to argue about words . That doesn ’ t have any value . It only destroys those who listen .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	15	Do your best to please God . Be a worker who doesn ’ t need to be ashamed . Teach the message of truth correctly .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	16	Stay away from godless chatter . Those who take part in it will become more and more ungodly .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	17	Their teaching will spread like a deadly sickness . Hymenaeus and Philetus are two of those teachers .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	18	They have turned away from the truth . They say that the time when people will rise from the dead has already come . They destroy the faith of some people .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	19	But God ’ s solid foundation stands firm . Here is the message written on it . “ The Lord knows who his own people are. ” ( Numbers 16:5 ) Also , “ All who say they believe in the Lord must turn away from evil. ”
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	20	In a large house there are things made out of gold and silver . But there are also things made out of wood and clay . Some have special purposes . Others have common purposes .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	21	Suppose someone stays away from what is common . Then the Master will be able to use them for special purposes . They will be made holy . They will be ready to do any good work .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	22	Run away from the evil things that young people long for . Try hard to do what is right . Have faith , love and peace . Do these things together with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	23	Don ’ t have anything to do with arguing . It is dumb and foolish . You know it only leads to fights .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	24	Anyone who serves the Lord must not be hard to get along with . Instead , they must be kind to everyone . They must be able to teach . The one who serves must not hold anything against anyone .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	25	They must gently teach those who are against them . Maybe God will give a change of heart to those who are against you . That will lead them to know the truth .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	2	26	Maybe they will come to their senses . Maybe they will escape the devil ’ s trap . He has taken them as prisoners to do what he wanted . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Timothy	3	6	They are the kind who trick their way into the homes of some women . These women are ready to believe anything . And they take control over these women . These women are loaded down with sins . They give in to all kinds of evil desires .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	3	7	They are always learning . But they are never able to come to know the truth .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	3	8	Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses . In the same way , the teachers I ’ m talking about oppose the truth . Their minds are twisted . As far as the faith is concerned , God doesn ’ t accept them .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	3	9	They won ’ t get very far . Just like Jannes and Jambres , their foolish ways will be clear to everyone . Paul Gives a Final Command to Timothy

NIRV	2%20Timothy	3	11	You know that I was treated badly . You know that I suffered greatly . You know what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch , Iconium and Lystra . You know how badly I have been treated . But the Lord saved me from all my troubles .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	3	12	In fact , everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be treated badly .
NIRV	2%20Timothy	3	13	Evil people and pretenders will go from bad to worse . They will fool others , and others will fool them .

NIRV	Titus	1	1	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I serve God , and I am an apostle of Jesus Christ . God sent me to help his chosen people believe in Christ more and more . God sent me to help them understand even more the truth that leads to godly living .
NIRV	Titus	1	2	That belief and understanding lead to the hope of eternal life . Before time began , God promised to give that life . And he does not lie .
NIRV	Titus	1	3	Now , at just the right time , he has made his promise clear . He did this through the preaching that he trusted me with . God our Savior has commanded all these things .
NIRV	Titus	1	4	Titus , I am sending you this letter . You are my true son in the faith we share . May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior give you grace and peace . Choosing Elders Who Love What Is Good
NIRV	Titus	1	5	I left you on the island of Crete . I did this because there were some things that hadn ’ t been finished . I wanted you to put them in order . I also wanted you to appoint elders in every town . I told you how to do it .
NIRV	Titus	1	6	An elder must be without blame . He must be faithful to his wife . His children must be believers . They must not give anyone a reason to say that they are wild and don ’ t obey .
NIRV	Titus	1	7	A church leader takes care of God ’ s family . That ’ s why he must be without blame . He must not look after only his own interests . He must not get angry easily . He must not get drunk . He must not push people around . He must not try to get money by cheating people .
NIRV	Titus	1	8	Instead , a church leader must welcome people into his home . He must love what is good . He must control his mind and feelings . He must do what is right . He must be holy . He must control the desires of his body .
NIRV	Titus	1	9	The message as it has been taught can be trusted . He must hold firmly to it . Then he will be able to use true teaching to comfort others and build them up . He will be able to prove that people who oppose it are wrong . Warning People Who Fail to Do Good
NIRV	Titus	1	10	Many people refuse to obey God . All they do is talk about things that mean nothing . They try to fool others . No one does these things more than the circumcision group .
NIRV	Titus	1	11	They must be stopped . They are making trouble for entire families . They do this by teaching things they shouldn ’ t . They do these things to cheat people .
NIRV	Titus	1	12	One of Crete ’ s own prophets has a saying . He says , “ People from Crete are always liars . They are evil beasts . They don ’ t want to work . They live only to eat. ”
NIRV	Titus	1	13	This saying is true . So give a strong warning to people who refuse to obey God . Then they will understand the faith correctly .
NIRV	Titus	1	14	Then they will pay no attention to Jewish stories that aren ’ t true . They won ’ t listen to the mere human commands of people who turn away from the truth .
NIRV	Titus	1	15	To people who are pure , all things are pure . But to those who have twisted minds and don ’ t believe , nothing is pure . In fact , their minds and their sense of what is right and wrong are twisted .
NIRV	Titus	1	16	They claim to know God . But their actions show they don ’ t know him . They are hated by God . They refuse to obey him . They aren ’ t fit to do anything good . Copyright ©

NIRV	Titus	2	2	Tell the older men that in anything they do , they must not go too far . They must be worthy of respect . They must control themselves . They must have true faith . They must love others . They must not give up .
NIRV	Titus	2	3	In the same way , teach the older women to lead a holy life . They must not tell lies about others . They must not let wine control them . Instead , they must teach what is good .
NIRV	Titus	2	4	Then they can advise the younger women to love their husbands and children .
NIRV	Titus	2	5	The younger women must control themselves and be pure . They must take good care of their homes . They must be kind . They must follow the lead of their husbands . Then no one will be able to speak evil things against God ’ s word .
NIRV	Titus	2	6	In the same way , help the young men to control themselves .
NIRV	Titus	2	7	Do what is good . Set an example for them in everything . When you teach , be honest and serious .
NIRV	Titus	2	8	No one can question the truth . So teach what is true . Then those who oppose you will be ashamed . That ’ s because they will have nothing bad to say about us .
NIRV	Titus	2	9	Teach slaves to obey their masters in everything they do . Tell them to try to please their masters . They must not talk back to them .
NIRV	Titus	2	10	They must not steal from them . Instead , they must show that they can be trusted completely . Then they will make the teaching about God our Savior appealing in every way .
NIRV	Titus	2	11	God ’ s grace has now appeared . By his grace , God offers to save all people .
NIRV	Titus	2	12	His grace teaches us to say no to godless ways and sinful desires . We must control ourselves . We must do what is right . We must lead godly lives in today ’ s world .
NIRV	Titus	2	13	That ’ s how we should live as we wait for the blessed hope God has given us . We are waiting for Jesus Christ to appear in his glory . He is our great God and Savior .
NIRV	Titus	2	14	He gave himself for us . By doing that , he set us free from all evil . He wanted to make us pure . He wanted us to be his very own people . He wanted us to desire to do what is good .
NIRV	Titus	2	15	These are the things you should teach . Encourage people and give them hope . Correct them with full authority . Don ’ t let anyone look down on you . Copyright ©

NIRV	Titus	3	3	At one time we too acted like fools . We didn ’ t obey God . We were tricked . We were controlled by all kinds of desires and pleasures . We were full of evil . We wanted what belongs to others . People hated us , and we hated one another .
NIRV	Titus	3	2	Tell them not to speak evil things against anyone . Remind them to live in peace . They must consider the needs of others . They must always be gentle toward everyone .
NIRV	Titus	3	4	But the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared .
NIRV	Titus	3	5	He saved us . It wasn ’ t because of the good things we had done . It was because of his mercy . He saved us by washing away our sins . We were born again . The Holy Spirit gave us new life .
NIRV	Titus	3	6	God poured out the Spirit on us freely . That ’ s because of what Jesus Christ our Savior has done .
NIRV	Titus	3	7	His grace made us right with God . So now we have received the hope of eternal life as God ’ s children .
NIRV	Titus	3	8	You can trust this saying . These things are important . Treat them that way . Then those who trust in God will be careful to commit themselves to doing good . These things are excellent . They are for the good of everyone .
NIRV	Titus	3	9	But keep away from foolish disagreements . Don ’ t argue about family histories . Don ’ t make trouble . Don ’ t fight about what the law teaches . Don ’ t argue about things like that . It doesn ’ t do any good . It doesn ’ t help anyone .
NIRV	Titus	3	10	Warn anyone who tries to get believers to separate from one another . Warn that person more than once . After that , have nothing to do with them .
NIRV	Titus	3	11	You can be sure that people like this are twisted and sinful . Their own actions judge them . Final Words
NIRV	Titus	3	12	I will send Artemas or Tychicus to you . Then do your best to come to me at Nicopolis . I ’ ve decided to spend the winter there .
NIRV	Titus	3	13	Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos . Send them on their way . See that they have everything they need .

NIRV	Philemon	1	1	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I am a prisoner because of Christ Jesus . Our brother Timothy joins me in writing . Philemon , we are sending you this letter . You are our dear friend . You work together with us .
NIRV	Philemon	1	2	We are also sending it to our sister Apphia and to Archippus . He is a soldier of Christ together with us . And we are sending it to the church that meets in your home .
NIRV	Philemon	1	3	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace . Paul Prays and Gives Thanks
NIRV	Philemon	1	4	I always thank my God when I remember you in my prayers .
NIRV	Philemon	1	5	That ’ s because I hear about your love for all God ’ s people . I also hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus .
NIRV	Philemon	1	6	I pray that what we share by believing will help you understand even more . Then you will completely understand every good thing we share by believing in Christ .
NIRV	Philemon	1	7	Your love has given me great joy . It has encouraged me . My brother , you have renewed the hearts of the Lord ’ s people . Paul Makes an Appeal for Onesimus
NIRV	Philemon	1	8	Because of the authority Christ has given me , I could be bold . I could order you to do what you should do anyway .
NIRV	Philemon	1	9	But we love each other . And I would rather appeal to you on the basis of that love . I , Paul , am an old man . I am now also a prisoner because of Christ Jesus .
NIRV	Philemon	1	10	I am an old man , and I ’ m in prison . This is how I make my appeal to you for my son Onesimus . He became a son to me while I was being held in chains .
NIRV	Philemon	1	11	Before that , he was useless to you . But now he has become useful to you and to me .
NIRV	Philemon	1	12	I ’ m sending Onesimus back to you . All my love for him goes with him .
NIRV	Philemon	1	13	I ’ m being held in chains because of the good news . So I would have liked to keep Onesimus with me . And he could take your place in helping me .
NIRV	Philemon	1	14	But I didn ’ t want to do anything unless you agreed . Any favor you do must be done because you want to do it , not because you have to .
NIRV	Philemon	1	15	Onesimus was separated from you for a little while . Maybe that was so you could have him back forever .
NIRV	Philemon	1	16	You could have him back not as a slave . Instead , he would be better than a slave . He would be a dear brother . He is very dear to me but even more dear to you . He is dear to you not only as another human being . He is also dear to you as a brother in the Lord .
NIRV	Philemon	1	17	Do you think of me as a believer who works together with you ? Then welcome Onesimus as you would welcome me .
NIRV	Philemon	1	18	Has he done anything wrong to you ? Does he owe you anything ? Then charge it to me .
NIRV	Philemon	1	19	I ’ ll pay it back . I , Paul , am writing this with my own hand . I won ’ t even mention that you owe me your life .
NIRV	Philemon	1	20	My brother , we both belong to the Lord . So I wish I could receive some benefit from you . Renew my heart . We know that Christ is the one who really renews it .
NIRV	Philemon	1	21	I ’ m sure you will obey . So I ’ m writing to you . I know you will do even more than I ask .
NIRV	Philemon	1	22	There is one more thing . Have a guest room ready for me . I hope I can return to all of you in answer to your prayers .
NIRV	Philemon	1	23	Epaphras sends you greetings . Together with me , he is a prisoner because of Christ Jesus .
NIRV	Philemon	1	24	Mark , Aristarchus , Demas and Luke work together with me . They also send you greetings .

NIRV	Hebrews	1	1	Chronicles 17:13 )
NIRV	Hebrews	1	2	Samuel 7:14 ;
NIRV	Hebrews	1	3	The Son is the shining brightness of God ’ s glory . He is the exact likeness of God ’ s being . He uses his powerful word to hold all things together . He provided the way for people to be made pure from sin . Then he sat down at the right hand of the King , the Majesty in heaven .
NIRV	Hebrews	1	4	So he became higher than the angels . The name he received is more excellent than theirs . The Son Is Greater Than the Angels
NIRV	Hebrews	1	5	God never said to any of the angels , “ You are my Son . Today I have become your Father. ” ( Psalm 2:7 ) Or , “ I will be his Father . And he will be my Son. ” (
NIRV	Hebrews	1	6	God ’ s first and only Son is over all things . When God brings him into the world , he says , “ Let all God ’ s angels worship him. ” ( Deuteronomy 32:43 )
NIRV	Hebrews	1	7	Here is something else God says about the angels . “ God makes his angels to be like spirits . He makes those who serve him to be like flashes of lightning. ” ( Psalm 104:4 )
NIRV	Hebrews	1	8	But here is what he says about the Son . “ You are God . Your throne will last for ever and ever . Your kingdom will be ruled by justice .
NIRV	Hebrews	1	9	You have loved what is right and hated what is evil . So your God has placed you above your companions . He has filled you with joy by pouring the sacred oil on your head. ” ( Psalm 45:6,7 )
NIRV	Hebrews	1	10	He also says , “ Lord , in the beginning you made the earth secure . You placed it on its foundations . The heavens are the work of your hands .
NIRV	Hebrews	1	11	They will pass away . But you remain . They will all wear out like a piece of clothing .
NIRV	Hebrews	1	12	You will roll them up like a robe . They will be changed as a person changes clothes . But you remain the same . Your years will never end. ” ( Psalm 102:25–27 )
NIRV	Hebrews	1	13	God never said to an angel , “ Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your control. ” ( Psalm 110:1 )
NIRV	Hebrews	1	14	All angels are spirits who serve . God sends them to serve those who will receive salvation . Copyright ©

NIRV	Hebrews	2	2	Even the message God spoke through angels had to be obeyed . Every time people broke the Law , they were punished . Every time they didn ’ t obey , they were punished .
NIRV	Hebrews	2	3	Then how will we escape if we don ’ t pay attention to God ’ s great salvation ? The Lord first announced this salvation . Those who heard him gave us the message about it .
NIRV	Hebrews	2	4	God showed that this message is true by signs and wonders . He showed that it ’ s true by different kinds of miracles . God also showed that this message is true by the gifts of the Holy Spirit . God gave them out as it pleased him . Jesus Was Made Fully Human
NIRV	Hebrews	2	5	God has not put angels in charge of the world that is going to come . We are talking about that world .
NIRV	Hebrews	2	6	There is a place where someone has spoken about this . He said , “ What are human beings that you think about them ? What is a son of man that you take care of him ?
NIRV	Hebrews	2	7	You made them a little lower than the angels . You placed on them a crown of glory and honor .
NIRV	Hebrews	2	8	You have put everything under their control. ” ( Psalm 8:4–6 ) So God has put everything under his Son . Everything is under his control . We do not now see everything under his control .
NIRV	Hebrews	2	9	But we do see Jesus already given a crown of glory and honor . He was made lower than the angels for a little while . He suffered death . By the grace of God , he tasted death for everyone . That is why he was given his crown .
NIRV	Hebrews	2	10	God has made everything . He is now bringing his many sons and daughters to share in his glory . It is only right that Jesus is the one to lead them into their salvation . That ’ s because God made him perfect by his sufferings .
NIRV	Hebrews	2	11	And Jesus , who makes people holy , and the people he makes holy belong to the same family . So Jesus is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters .
NIRV	Hebrews	2	12	He says , “ I will announce your name to my brothers and sisters . I will sing your praises among those who worship you. ” ( Psalm 22:22 )
NIRV	Hebrews	2	13	Again he says , “ I will put my trust in him. ” ( Isaiah 8:17 ) And again he says , “ Here I am . Here are the children God has given me. ” ( Isaiah 8:18 )
NIRV	Hebrews	2	14	Those children have bodies made out of flesh and blood . So Jesus became human like them in order to die for them . By doing this , he could break the power of the devil . The devil is the one who rules over the kingdom of death .
NIRV	Hebrews	2	15	Jesus could set people free who were afraid of death . All their lives they were held as slaves by that fear .
NIRV	Hebrews	2	16	It is certainly Abraham ’ s children that he helps . He doesn ’ t help angels .
NIRV	Hebrews	2	17	So he had to be made like people , fully human in every way . Then he could serve God as a kind and faithful high priest . And then he could pay for the sins of the people by dying for them .
NIRV	Hebrews	2	18	He himself suffered when he was tempted . Now he is able to help others who are being tempted . Copyright ©

NIRV	Hebrews	3	3	The person who builds a house has greater honor than the house itself . In the same way , Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses .
NIRV	Hebrews	3	2	Moses was faithful in everything he did in the house of God . In the same way , Jesus was faithful to the God who appointed him .
NIRV	Hebrews	3	4	Every house is built by someone . But God is the builder of everything .
NIRV	Hebrews	3	5	“ Moses was faithful as one who serves in the house of God. ” ( Numbers 12:7 ) He was a witness to what God would say in days to come .
NIRV	Hebrews	3	6	But Christ is faithful as the Son over the house of God . And we are his house if we hold tightly to what we are certain about . We must also hold tightly to the hope we boast in . A Warning Against Unbelief
NIRV	Hebrews	3	7	The Holy Spirit says , “ Listen to his voice today .
NIRV	Hebrews	3	8	If you hear it , don ’ t be stubborn . You were stubborn when you opposed me . You did that when you were tested in the desert .
NIRV	Hebrews	3	9	There your people of long ago tested me . Yet for
NIRV	Hebrews	3	40	years ? Wasn ’ t it with those who sinned ? They died in the desert .
NIRV	Hebrews	3	10	That is why I was angry with them . I said , ‘ Their hearts are always going astray . They have not known my ways. ’
NIRV	Hebrews	3	11	So when I was angry , I made a promise . I said , ‘ They will never enjoy the rest I planned for them. ’ ” ( Psalm 95:7–11 )
NIRV	Hebrews	3	12	Brothers and sisters , make sure that none of you has a sinful heart . Do not let an unbelieving heart turn you away from the living God .
NIRV	Hebrews	3	13	But build one another up every day . Do it as long as there is still time . Then none of you will become stubborn . You won ’ t be fooled by sin ’ s tricks .
NIRV	Hebrews	3	14	We belong to Christ if we hold tightly to the faith we had at first . But we must hold it tightly until the end .
NIRV	Hebrews	3	15	It has just been said , “ Listen to his voice today . If you hear it , don ’ t be stubborn . You were stubborn when you opposed me. ” ( Psalm 95:7,8 )
NIRV	Hebrews	3	16	Who were those who heard and refused to obey ? Weren ’ t they all the people Moses led out of Egypt ?
NIRV	Hebrews	3	17	Who was God angry with for
NIRV	Hebrews	3	18	God promised that those people would never enjoy the rest he planned for them . God gave his word when he made that promise . Didn ’ t he make that promise to those who didn ’ t obey ?
NIRV	Hebrews	3	19	So we see that they weren ’ t able to enter . That ’ s because they didn ’ t believe . Copyright ©

NIRV	Hebrews	4	4	Somewhere he spoke about the seventh day . He said , “ On the seventh day God rested from all his works. ” ( Genesis 2:2 )
NIRV	Hebrews	4	2	The good news was announced to our people of long ago . It has also been preached to us . The message they heard didn ’ t have any value for them . That ’ s because they didn ’ t share the faith of those who obeyed .
NIRV	Hebrews	4	3	Now we who have believed enjoy that rest . God said , “ When I was angry , I made a promise . I said , ‘ They will never enjoy the rest I planned for them. ’ ” ( Psalm 95:11 ) Ever since God created the world , his works have been finished .
NIRV	Hebrews	4	5	In the part of Scripture I talked about earlier God spoke . He said , “ They will never enjoy the rest I planned for them. ” ( Psalm 95:11 )
NIRV	Hebrews	4	6	It is still true that some people will enjoy this rest . But those who had the good news announced to them earlier didn ’ t go in . That ’ s because they didn ’ t obey .
NIRV	Hebrews	4	7	So God again chose a certain day . He named it Today . He did this when he spoke through David a long time later . Here is what was written in the Scripture already given . “ Listen to his voice today . If you hear it , don ’ t be stubborn. ” ( Psalm 95:7,8 )
NIRV	Hebrews	4	8	Suppose Joshua had given them rest . If he had , God would not have spoken later about another day .
NIRV	Hebrews	4	9	So there is still a Sabbath rest for God ’ s people .
NIRV	Hebrews	4	10	God rested from his work . Those who enjoy God ’ s rest also rest from their works .
NIRV	Hebrews	4	11	So let us make every effort to enjoy that rest . Then no one will die by disobeying as they did .
NIRV	Hebrews	4	12	The word of God is alive and active . It is sharper than any sword that has two edges . It cuts deep enough to separate soul from spirit . It can separate bones from joints . It judges the thoughts and purposes of the heart .
NIRV	Hebrews	4	13	Nothing God created is hidden from him . His eyes see everything . He will hold us responsible for everything we do . Jesus Is the Great High Priest
NIRV	Hebrews	4	14	We have a great high priest . He has gone up into heaven . He is Jesus the Son of God . So let us hold firmly to what we say we believe .
NIRV	Hebrews	4	15	We have a high priest who can feel it when we are weak and hurting . We have a high priest who has been tempted in every way , just as we are . But he did not sin .
NIRV	Hebrews	4	16	So let us boldly approach God ’ s throne of grace . Then we will receive mercy . We will find grace to help us when we need it . Copyright ©

NIRV	Hebrews	5	5	It was the same for Christ . He did not take for himself the glory of becoming a high priest . But God said to him , “ You are my Son . Today I have become your Father. ” ( Psalm 2:7 )
NIRV	Hebrews	5	2	Some people have gone astray without knowing it . He is able to deal gently with them . He can do that because he himself is weak .
NIRV	Hebrews	5	3	That ’ s why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins . He must also do it for the sins of the people .
NIRV	Hebrews	5	4	And no one can take this honor for himself . Instead , he receives it when he is appointed by God . That is just how it was for Aaron .
NIRV	Hebrews	5	6	In another place God said , “ You are a priest forever , just like Melchizedek. ” ( Psalm 110:4 )
NIRV	Hebrews	5	7	Jesus prayed while he lived on earth . He made his appeal with sincere cries and tears . He prayed to the God who could save him from death . God answered Jesus because he truly honored God .
NIRV	Hebrews	5	8	Jesus was God ’ s Son . But by suffering he learned what it means to obey .
NIRV	Hebrews	5	9	In this way he was made perfect . Eternal salvation comes from him . He saves all those who obey him .
NIRV	Hebrews	5	10	God appointed him to be the high priest , just like Melchizedek . A Warning Against Falling Away
NIRV	Hebrews	5	11	We have a lot to say about this . But it is hard to make it clear to you . That ’ s because you are no longer trying to understand .
NIRV	Hebrews	5	12	By this time you should be teachers . But in fact , you need someone to teach you all over again . You need even the simple truths of God ’ s word . You need milk , not solid food .
NIRV	Hebrews	5	13	Anyone who lives on milk is still a baby . That person does not want to learn about living a godly life .
NIRV	Hebrews	5	14	Solid food is for those who are grown up . They have trained themselves to tell the difference between good and evil . That shows they have grown up . Copyright ©

NIRV	Hebrews	6	6	But they have fallen away from the faith . So it won ’ t be possible to bring them back . They won ’ t be able to turn away from their sins . They are losing everything . That ’ s because they are nailing the Son of God to the cross all over again . They are bringing shame on him in front of everyone .
NIRV	Hebrews	6	2	These basic teachings taught us about different ways of becoming “ clean. ” They taught us about placing hands of blessing on people . They taught us that people will rise from the dead . They taught us that God will judge everyone . And they taught us that what he decides will last forever .
NIRV	Hebrews	6	3	If God permits , we will go beyond those teachings and grow up .
NIRV	Hebrews	6	4	What if some people fall away from the faith ? It won ’ t be possible to bring them back . It is true that they have seen the light . They have tasted the heavenly gift . They have shared in the Holy Spirit .
NIRV	Hebrews	6	5	They have tasted the good things of God ’ s word . They have tasted the powers of the age to come .
NIRV	Hebrews	6	7	Some land drinks the rain that falls on it . It produces a crop that is useful to those who farm the land . That land receives God ’ s blessing .
NIRV	Hebrews	6	8	But other land produces only thorns and weeds . That land isn ’ t worth anything . It is in danger of coming under God ’ s curse . In the end , it will be burned .
NIRV	Hebrews	6	9	Dear friends , we have to say these things . But we are sure of better things in your case . We are talking about the things that have to do with being saved .
NIRV	Hebrews	6	10	God is fair . He will not forget what you have done . He will remember the love you have shown him . You showed it when you helped his people . And you show it when you keep on helping them .
NIRV	Hebrews	6	11	We want each of you to be faithful to the very end . If you are , then what you hope for will fully happen .
NIRV	Hebrews	6	12	We don ’ t want you to slow down . Instead , be like those who have faith and are patient . They will receive what God promised . God Keeps His Promise
NIRV	Hebrews	6	13	When God made his promise to Abraham , God gave his word . There was no one greater than himself to promise by . So he promised by making an appeal to himself .
NIRV	Hebrews	6	14	He said , “ I will certainly bless you . I will give you many children. ” ( Genesis 22:17 )
NIRV	Hebrews	6	15	Abraham was patient while he waited . Then he received what God promised him .
NIRV	Hebrews	6	16	People promise things by someone greater than themselves . Giving your word makes a promise certain . It puts an end to all arguing .
NIRV	Hebrews	6	17	So God gave his word when he made his promise . He wanted to make it very clear that his purpose does not change . He wanted those who would receive what was promised to know this .
NIRV	Hebrews	6	18	When God made his promise , he gave his word . He did this so we would have good reason not to give up . Instead , we have run to take hold of the hope set before us . This hope is set before us in God ’ s promise . So God made his promise and gave his word . These two things can ’ t change . He couldn ’ t lie about them .
NIRV	Hebrews	6	19	Our hope is certain . It is something for the soul to hold on to . It is strong and secure . It goes all the way into the Most Holy Room behind the curtain .
NIRV	Hebrews	6	20	That is where Jesus has gone . He went there to open the way ahead of us . He has become a high priest forever , just like Melchizedek . Copyright ©

NIRV	Hebrews	7	7	Without a doubt , the more important person blesses the less important one .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	2	Abraham gave him a tenth of everything . First , the name Melchizedek means “ king of what is right. ” Also , “ king of Salem ” means “ king of peace. ”
NIRV	Hebrews	7	3	Melchizedek has no father or mother . He has no family line . His days have no beginning . His life has no end . He remains a priest forever . In this way , he is like the Son of God .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	4	Think how great Melchizedek was ! Even our father Abraham gave him a tenth of what he had captured .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	5	Now the law lays down a rule for the sons of Levi who become priests . They must collect a tenth from the people . They must collect it from the other Israelites . They must do this , even though all of them belong to the family line of Abraham .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	6	Melchizedek did not trace his family line from Levi . But he collected a tenth from Abraham . Melchizedek blessed the one who had received the promises .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	8	In the one case , the tenth is collected by people who die . But in the other case , it is collected by the one who is said to be living .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	9	Levi collects the tenth . But we might say that Levi paid the tenth through Abraham .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	10	That ’ s because when Melchizedek met Abraham , Levi was still in Abraham ’ s body . Jesus Is Like Melchizedek
NIRV	Hebrews	7	11	The law that was given to the people called for the priestly system . That system began with Levi . Suppose the priestly system could have made people perfect . Then why was there still a need for another priest to come ? And why did he need to be like Melchizedek ? Why wasn ’ t he from Aaron ’ s family line ?
NIRV	Hebrews	7	12	A change of the priestly system requires a change of law .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	13	We are talking about a priest who is from a different tribe . No one from that tribe has ever served at the altar .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	14	It is clear that our Lord came from the family line of Judah . Moses said nothing about priests who were from the tribe of Judah .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	15	But suppose another priest like Melchizedek appears . Then what we have said is even more clear .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	16	He has not become a priest because of a rule about his family line . He has become a priest because of his powerful life . His life can never be destroyed .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	17	Scripture says , “ You are a priest forever , just like Melchizedek. ” ( Psalm 110:4 )
NIRV	Hebrews	7	18	The old rule is set aside . It was weak and useless .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	19	The law didn ’ t make anything perfect . Now a better hope has been given to us . That hope brings us near to God .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	20	The change of priestly system was made with a promise . Others became priests without any promise .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	21	But Jesus became a priest with a promise . God said to him , “ The Lord has given his word and made a promise . He will not change his mind . He has said , ‘ You are a priest forever. ’ ” ( Psalm 110:4 )
NIRV	Hebrews	7	22	Because God gave his word , Jesus makes certain the promise of a better covenant .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	23	There were many priests in Levi ’ s family line . Death kept them from continuing in office .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	24	But Jesus lives forever . So he always holds the office of priest .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	25	People now come to God through him . And he is able to save them completely and for all time . Jesus lives forever . He prays for them .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	26	A high priest like that really meets our need . He is holy , pure and without blame . He isn ’ t like other people . He does not sin . He is lifted high above the heavens .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	27	He isn ’ t like the other high priests . They need to offer sacrifices day after day . First they bring offerings for their own sins . Then they do it for the sins of the people . But Jesus gave one sacrifice for the sins of the people . He gave it once and for all time . He did it by offering himself .
NIRV	Hebrews	7	28	The law appoints as high priests men who are weak . But God ’ s promise came after the law . By his promise the Son was appointed . The Son has been made perfect forever . Copyright ©

NIRV	Hebrews	8	8	But God found fault with the people . He said , “ The days are coming , announces the Lord . I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel . I will also make it with the people of Judah .
NIRV	Hebrews	8	2	He serves in the sacred tent . The Lord set up the true holy tent . A mere human being did not set it up .
NIRV	Hebrews	8	3	Every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices . So this priest also had to have something to offer .
NIRV	Hebrews	8	4	What if he were on earth ? Then he would not be a priest . There are already priests who offer the gifts required by the law .
NIRV	Hebrews	8	5	They serve at a sacred tent . But it is only a copy and shadow of what is in heaven . That ’ s why God warned Moses when he was about to build the holy tent . God said , “ Be sure to make everything just like the pattern I showed you on the mountain. ” ( Exodus 25:40 )
NIRV	Hebrews	8	6	But Jesus has been given a greater work to do for God . He is the go-between for the new covenant . This covenant is better than the old one . The new covenant is based on better promises .
NIRV	Hebrews	8	7	Suppose nothing had been wrong with that first covenant . Then no one would have looked for another covenant .
NIRV	Hebrews	8	9	It will not be like the covenant I made with their people of long ago . That was when I took them by the hand . I led them out of Egypt . My new covenant will be different because they didn ’ t remain faithful to my old covenant . So I turned away from them , announces the Lord .
NIRV	Hebrews	8	10	This is the covenant I will establish with the people of Israel after that time , says the Lord . I will put my laws in their minds . I will write them on their hearts . I will be their God . And they will be my people .
NIRV	Hebrews	8	11	People will not teach their neighbor anymore . They will not say to one another , ‘ Know the Lord. ’ That ’ s because everyone will know me . From the least important to the most important , all of them will know me .
NIRV	Hebrews	8	12	I will forgive their evil ways . I will not remember their sins anymore. ” ( Jeremiah 31:31–34 )
NIRV	Hebrews	8	13	God called this covenant “ new. ” So he has done away with the first one . And what is out of date and has been done away with will soon disappear . Copyright ©

NIRV	Hebrews	9	9	That ’ s an example for the present time . It shows us that the gifts and sacrifices people offered were not enough . They were not able to remove the worshiper ’ s feelings of guilt .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	2	A holy tent was set up . The lampstand was in the first room . So was the table with its holy bread . That was called the Holy Room .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	3	Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Room .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	4	It had the golden altar for incense . It also had the wooden chest called the ark of the covenant . The ark was covered with gold . It held the gold jar of manna . It held Aaron ’ s walking stick that had budded . It also held the stone tablets . The words of the covenant were written on them .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	5	The cherubim were above the ark . God showed his glory there . The cherubim spread their wings over the place where sin was paid for . But we can ’ t say everything about these things now .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	6	That ’ s how everything was arranged in the holy tent . The priests entered it at regular times . They went into the outer room to do their work for God and others .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	7	But only the high priest went into the inner room . He went in only once a year . He never entered without taking blood with him . He offered the blood for himself . He also offered it for the sins the people had committed because they didn ’ t know any better .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	8	Here is what the Holy Spirit was showing us . He was telling us that God had not yet clearly shown the way into the Most Holy Room . It would not be clearly shown as long as the first holy tent was still being used .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	10	They deal only with food and drink and different kinds of special washings . They are rules people had to obey only until the new covenant came . The Blood of Christ
NIRV	Hebrews	9	11	But Christ came to be the high priest of the good things already here now . When he came , he went through the greater and more perfect holy tent . This tent was not made with human hands . In other words , it is not a part of this creation .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	12	He did not enter by spilling the blood of goats and calves . He entered the Most Holy Room by spilling his own blood . He did it once and for all time . In this way , he paid the price to set us free from sin forever .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	13	The blood of goats and bulls is sprinkled on people . So are the ashes of a young cow . They are sprinkled on people the law called “ unclean. ” The people are sprinkled to make them holy . That makes them “ clean ” on the outside .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	14	But Christ offered himself to God without any flaw . He did this through the power of the eternal Holy Spirit . So how much cleaner will the blood of Christ make us ! It washes away our feelings of guilt for committing sin . Sin always leads to death . But now we can serve the living God .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	15	That ’ s why Christ is the go-between of a new covenant . Now those God calls to himself will receive the eternal gift he promised . They will receive it now that Christ has died to save them . He died to set them free from the sins they committed under the first covenant .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	16	What happens when someone leaves a will ? It is necessary to prove that the person who made the will has died .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	17	A will is in effect only when somebody has died . It never takes effect while the one who made it is still living .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	18	That ’ s why even the first covenant was not put into effect without the spilling of blood .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	19	Moses first announced every command of the law to all the people . Then he took the blood of calves . He also took water , bright red wool and branches of a hyssop plant . He sprinkled the Book of the Covenant . He also sprinkled all the people .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	20	He said , “ This is the blood of the covenant God has commanded you to keep. ” ( Exodus 24:8 )
NIRV	Hebrews	9	21	In the same way , he sprinkled the holy tent with blood . He also sprinkled everything that was used in worship there .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	22	In fact , the law requires that nearly everything be made “ clean ” with blood . Without the spilling of blood , no one can be forgiven .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	23	So the copies of the heavenly things had to be made pure with these sacrifices . But the heavenly things themselves had to be made pure with better sacrifices .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	24	Christ did not enter a sacred tent made with human hands . That tent was only a copy of the true one . He entered heaven itself . He did it to stand in front of God for us . He is there right now .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	25	The high priest enters the Most Holy Room every year . He enters with blood that is not his own . But Christ did not enter heaven to offer himself again and again .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	26	If he had , he would have had to suffer many times since the world was created . But he has appeared once and for all time . He has come at the time when God ’ s work is being completed . He has come to do away with sin by offering himself .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	27	People have to die once . After that , God will judge them .
NIRV	Hebrews	9	28	In the same way , Christ was offered up once . He took away the sins of many people . He will also come a second time . At that time he will not suffer for sin . Instead , he will come to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him . Copyright ©

NIRV	Hebrews	10	10	We have been made holy by what God wanted . We have been made holy because Jesus Christ offered his body once and for all time .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	2	If the law could , wouldn ’ t the sacrifices have stopped being offered ? The worshipers would have been made “ clean ” once and for all time . They would not have felt guilty for their sins anymore .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	3	But those offerings remind people of their sins every year .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	4	It isn ’ t possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	5	So when Christ came into the world , he said , “ You didn ’ t want sacrifices and offerings . Instead , you prepared a body for me .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	6	You weren ’ t pleased with burnt offerings and sin offerings .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	7	Then I said , ‘ Here I am . It is written about me in the book . I have come to do what you want , my God. ’ ” ( Psalm 40:6–8 )
NIRV	Hebrews	10	8	First Christ said , “ You didn ’ t want sacrifices and offerings . You didn ’ t want burnt offerings and sin offerings . You weren ’ t pleased with them. ” He said this even though they were offered in keeping with the law .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	9	Then he said , “ Here I am . I have come to do what you want. ” He did away with the shadow of the good things that were coming . He did it to put in place the good things themselves .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	11	Day after day every priest stands and does his special duties . He offers the same sacrifices again and again . But they can never take away sins .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	12	Jesus our priest offered one sacrifice for sins for all time . Then he sat down at the right hand of God .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	13	And since that time , he waits for his enemies to be put under his control .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	14	By that one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	15	The Holy Spirit also speaks to us about this . First he says ,
NIRV	Hebrews	10	16	“ This is the covenant I will make with them after that time , says the Lord . I will put my laws in their hearts . I will write my laws on their minds. ” ( Jeremiah 31:33 )
NIRV	Hebrews	10	17	Then he adds , “ I will not remember their sins anymore . I will not remember the evil things they have done. ” ( Jeremiah 31:34 )
NIRV	Hebrews	10	18	Where these sins have been forgiven , an offering for sin is no longer necessary . An Appeal and Warning to Remain Faithful
NIRV	Hebrews	10	19	Brothers and sisters , we are not afraid to enter the Most Holy Room . We enter boldly because of the blood of Jesus .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	20	His way is new because he lives . It has been opened for us through the curtain . I ’ m talking about his body .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	21	We also have a great priest over the house of God .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	22	So let us come near to God with a sincere heart . Let us come near boldly because of our faith . Our hearts have been sprinkled . Our minds have been cleansed from a sense of guilt . Our bodies have been washed with pure water .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	23	Let us hold firmly to the hope we claim to have . The God who promised is faithful .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	24	Let us consider how we can stir up one another to love . Let us help one another to do good works .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	25	And let us not give up meeting together . Some are in the habit of doing this . Instead , let us encourage one another with words of hope . Let us do this even more as you see Christ ’ s return approaching .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	26	What if we keep sinning on purpose ? What if we do it even after we know the truth ? Then there is no offering for our sins .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	27	All we can do is to wait in fear for God to judge . His blazing fire will burn up his enemies .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	28	Suppose someone did not obey the law of Moses . And suppose two or three witnesses made charges against them . That person would die without mercy .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	29	People who deserve even more punishment include those who have hated the Son of God . They include people who have said no to him . They include people who have treated as unholy the blood of the covenant that makes them holy . They also include people who have disrespected the Holy Spirit who brings God ’ s grace . Don ’ t you think people like this should be punished more than anyone else ?
NIRV	Hebrews	10	30	We know the God who said , “ I am the God who judges people . I will pay them back. ” ( Deuteronomy 32:35 ) Scripture also says , “ The Lord will judge his people. ” ( Deuteronomy 32:36 ; Psalm 135:14 )
NIRV	Hebrews	10	31	It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	32	Remember those earlier days after you received the light . You remained strong in a great battle that was full of suffering .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	33	Sometimes people spoke badly about you in front of others . Sometimes you were treated badly . At other times you stood side by side with people being treated like this .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	34	You suffered along with people in prison . When your property was taken from you , you accepted it with joy . You knew that God had given you better and more lasting things .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	35	So don ’ t throw away your bold faith . It will bring you rich rewards .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	36	You need to be faithful . Then you will do what God wants . You will receive what he has promised .
NIRV	Hebrews	10	37	“ In just a little while , he who is coming will come . He will not wait any longer. ”
NIRV	Hebrews	10	38	And , “ The one who is right with God will live by faith . And I am not pleased with the one who pulls back. ” ( Habakkuk 2:3,4 )
NIRV	Hebrews	10	39	But we don ’ t belong to the people who pull back and are destroyed . We belong to the people who believe and are saved . Copyright ©

NIRV	Hebrews	11	11	And Sarah had faith . So God made it possible for her to become a mother . She became a mother even though she was too old to have children . But Sarah believed that the God who made the promise was faithful .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	2	That is what the people of long ago were praised for .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	3	We have faith . So we understand that everything was made when God commanded it . That ’ s why we believe that what we see was not made out of what could be seen .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	4	Abel had faith . So he brought to God a better offering than Cain did . Because of his faith Abel was praised as a godly man . God said good things about his offerings . Because of his faith Abel still speaks . He speaks even though he is dead .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	5	Enoch had faith . So he was taken from this life . He didn ’ t die . “ He couldn ’ t be found , because God had taken him away. ” ( Genesis 5:24 ) Before God took him , Enoch was praised as one who pleased God .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	6	Without faith it is impossible to please God . Those who come to God must believe that he exists . And they must believe that he rewards those who look to him .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	7	Noah had faith . So he built an ark to save his family . He built it because of his great respect for God . God had warned him about things that could not yet be seen . Because of his faith Noah showed the world that it was guilty . Because of his faith he was considered right with God .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	8	Abraham had faith . So he obeyed God . God called him to go to a place he would later receive as his own . So he went . He did it even though he didn ’ t know where he was going .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	9	Because of his faith he made his home in the land God had promised him . Abraham was like an outsider in a strange country . He lived there in tents . So did Isaac and Jacob . They received the same promise he did .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	10	Abraham was looking forward to the city that has foundations . He was waiting for the city that God planned and built .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	12	Abraham was past the time when he could have children . But many children came from that one man . They were as many as the stars in the sky . They were as many as the grains of sand on the seashore . No one could count them .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	13	All these people were still living by faith when they died . They didn ’ t receive the things God had promised . They only saw them and welcomed them from a long way off . They openly said that they were outsiders and strangers on earth .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	14	People who say things like that show that they are looking for a country of their own .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	15	What if they had been thinking of the country they had left ? Then they could have returned to it .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	16	Instead , they longed for a better country . They wanted a heavenly one . So God is pleased when they call him their God . In fact , he has prepared a city for them .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	17	Abraham had faith . So when God tested him , Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice . Abraham had held on tightly to the promises . But he was about to offer his one and only son .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	18	God had said to him , “ Your family line will continue through Isaac. ” ( Genesis 21:12 ) Even so , Abraham was going to offer him up .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	19	Abraham did this , because he believed that God could even raise the dead . In a way , he did receive Isaac back from death .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	20	Isaac had faith . So he blessed Jacob and Esau . He told them what was ahead for them .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	21	Jacob had faith . So he blessed each of Joseph ’ s sons . He blessed them when he was dying . Because of his faith he worshiped God . Jacob worshiped as he leaned on the top of his walking stick .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	22	Joseph had faith . So he spoke to the people of Israel about how they would leave Egypt someday . When his death was near , he spoke about where to bury his bones .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	23	Moses ’ parents had faith . So they hid him for three months after he was born . They saw he was a special child . They were not afraid of the king ’ s command .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	24	Moses had faith . So he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh ’ s daughter . That happened after he had grown up .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	25	He chose to be treated badly together with the people of God . He chose not to enjoy sin ’ s pleasures . They only last for a short time .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	26	He suffered shame because of Christ . He thought it had great value . Moses considered it better than the riches of Egypt . He was looking ahead to his reward .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	27	Because of his faith , Moses left Egypt . It wasn ’ t because he was afraid of the king ’ s anger . He didn ’ t let anything stop him . That ’ s because he saw the God who can ’ t be seen .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	28	Because of his faith , Moses was the first to keep the Passover Feast . He commanded the people of Israel to sprinkle blood on their doorways . He did it so that the destroying angel would not touch their oldest sons .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	29	The people of Israel had faith . So they passed through the Red Sea . They went through it as if it were dry land . The Egyptians tried to do it also . But they drowned .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	30	Israel ’ s army had faith . So the walls of Jericho fell down . It happened after they had marched around the city for seven days .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	31	Rahab , the prostitute , had faith . So she welcomed the spies . That ’ s why she wasn ’ t killed with those who didn ’ t obey God .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	32	What more can I say ? I don ’ t have time to tell about all the others . I don ’ t have time to talk about Gideon , Barak , Samson and Jephthah . I don ’ t have time to tell about David and Samuel and the prophets .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	33	Because of their faith they took over kingdoms . They ruled fairly . They received the blessings God had promised . They shut the mouths of lions .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	34	They put out great fires . They escaped being killed by swords . Their weakness was turned to strength . They became powerful in battle . They beat back armies from other countries .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	35	Women received back their dead . The dead were raised to life again . There were others who were made to suffer greatly . But they refused to be set free . They did this so that after death they would be raised to an even better life .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	36	Some were made fun of and even whipped . Some were held by chains . Some were put in prison .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	37	Some were killed with stones . Some were sawed in two . Some were killed by swords . They went around wearing the skins of sheep and goats . They were poor . They were attacked . They were treated badly .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	38	The world was not worthy of them . They wandered in deserts and mountains . They lived in caves . They lived in holes in the ground .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	39	All these people were praised because they had faith . But none of them received what God had promised .
NIRV	Hebrews	11	40	That ’ s because God had planned something better for us . So they would only be made perfect together with us . Copyright ©

NIRV	Hebrews	12	12	So put your hands to work . Strengthen your legs for the journey .
NIRV	Hebrews	12	2	Let us keep looking to Jesus . He is the one who started this journey of faith . And he is the one who completes the journey of faith . He paid no attention to the shame of the cross . He suffered there because of the joy he was looking forward to . Then he sat down at the right hand of the throne of God .
NIRV	Hebrews	12	3	He made it through these attacks by sinners . So think about him . Then you won ’ t get tired . You won ’ t lose hope . God Trains His Children
NIRV	Hebrews	12	4	You struggle against sin . But you have not yet fought to the point of spilling your blood .
NIRV	Hebrews	12	5	Have you completely forgotten this word of hope ? It speaks to you as a father to his children . It says , “ My son , think of the Lord ’ s training as important . Do not lose hope when he corrects you .
NIRV	Hebrews	12	6	The Lord trains the one he loves . He corrects everyone he accepts as his son. ” ( Proverbs 3:11,12 )
NIRV	Hebrews	12	7	Put up with hard times . God uses them to train you . He is treating you as his children . What children are not trained by their parents ?
NIRV	Hebrews	12	8	God trains all his children . But what if he doesn ’ t train you ? Then you are not really his children . You are not God ’ s true sons and daughters at all .
NIRV	Hebrews	12	9	Besides , we have all had human fathers who trained us . We respected them for it . How much more should we be trained by the Father of spirits and live !
NIRV	Hebrews	12	10	Our parents trained us for a little while . They did what they thought was best . But God trains us for our good . He does this so we may share in his holiness .
NIRV	Hebrews	12	11	No training seems pleasant at the time . In fact , it seems painful . But later on it produces a harvest of godliness and peace . It does this for those who have been trained by it .
NIRV	Hebrews	12	13	“ Make level paths for your feet to walk on. ” ( Proverbs 4:26 ) Then those who have trouble walking won ’ t be disabled . Instead , they will be healed . A Warning and an Appeal
NIRV	Hebrews	12	14	Try your best to live in peace with everyone . Try hard to be holy . Without holiness no one will see the Lord .
NIRV	Hebrews	12	15	Be sure that no one misses out on God ’ s grace . See to it that a bitter plant doesn ’ t grow up . If it does , it will cause trouble . And it will make many people impure .
NIRV	Hebrews	12	16	See to it that no one commits sexual sins . See to it that no one is godless like Esau . He sold the rights to what he would receive as the oldest son . He sold them for a single meal .
NIRV	Hebrews	12	17	As you know , after that he wanted to receive his father ’ s blessing . But he was turned away . With tears he tried to get the blessing . But he couldn ’ t change what he had done . The Mountain of Fear and the Mountain of Joy
NIRV	Hebrews	12	18	You haven ’ t come to a mountain that can be touched . You haven ’ t come to a mountain burning with fire . You haven ’ t come to darkness , gloom and storm .
NIRV	Hebrews	12	19	You haven ’ t come to a blast from God ’ s trumpet . You haven ’ t come to a voice speaking to you . When people heard that voice long ago , they begged it not to say anything more to them .
NIRV	Hebrews	12	20	What God commanded was too much for them . He said , “ If even an animal touches the mountain , it must be killed with stones. ” ( Exodus 19:12,13 )
NIRV	Hebrews	12	21	The sight was terrifying . Moses said , “ I am trembling with fear. ” ( Deuteronomy 9:19 )
NIRV	Hebrews	12	22	But you have come to Mount Zion . You have come to the city of the living God . This is the heavenly Jerusalem . You have come to a joyful gathering of angels . There are thousands and thousands of them .
NIRV	Hebrews	12	23	You have come to the church of God ’ s people . God ’ s first and only Son is over all things . God ’ s people share in what belongs to his Son . Their names are written in heaven . You have come to God , who is the Judge of all people . You have come to the spirits of godly people who have been made perfect .
NIRV	Hebrews	12	24	You have come to Jesus . He is the go-between of a new covenant . You have come to the sprinkled blood . It promises better things than the blood of Abel .
NIRV	Hebrews	12	25	Be sure that you don ’ t say no to the one who speaks . People did not escape when they said no to the one who warned them on earth . And what if we turn away from the one who warns us from heaven ? How much less will we escape !
NIRV	Hebrews	12	26	At that time his voice shook the earth . But now he has promised , “ Once more I will shake the earth . I will also shake the heavens. ” ( Haggai 2:6 )
NIRV	Hebrews	12	27	The words “ once more ” point out that what can be shaken can be taken away . I ’ m talking about created things . Then what can ’ t be shaken will remain .
NIRV	Hebrews	12	28	We are receiving a kingdom that can ’ t be shaken . So let us be thankful . Then we can worship God in a way that pleases him . Let us worship him with deep respect and wonder .

NIRV	Hebrews	13	13	So let us go to him outside the camp . Let us be willing to suffer the shame he suffered .
NIRV	Hebrews	13	2	Don ’ t forget to welcome outsiders . By doing that , some people have welcomed angels without knowing it .
NIRV	Hebrews	13	3	Keep on remembering those in prison . Do this as if you were together with them in prison . And remember those who are treated badly as if you yourselves were suffering .
NIRV	Hebrews	13	4	All of you should honor marriage . You should keep the marriage bed pure . God will judge the person who commits adultery . He will judge everyone who commits sexual sins .
NIRV	Hebrews	13	5	Don ’ t be controlled by love for money . Be happy with what you have . God has said , “ I will never leave you . I will never desert you. ” ( Deuteronomy 31:6 )
NIRV	Hebrews	13	6	So we can say boldly , “ The Lord helps me . I will not be afraid . What can mere human beings do to me ? ” ( Psalm 118:6,7 )
NIRV	Hebrews	13	7	Remember your leaders . They spoke God ’ s word to you . Think about the results of their way of life . Copy their faith .
NIRV	Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever .
NIRV	Hebrews	13	9	Don ’ t let all kinds of strange teachings lead you astray . It is good that God ’ s grace makes our hearts strong . Don ’ t try to grow strong by eating foods that the law requires . They have no value for the people who eat them .
NIRV	Hebrews	13	10	The priests , who are Levites , worship at the holy tent . But we have an altar that they have no right to eat from .
NIRV	Hebrews	13	11	The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Room . He brings their blood as a sin offering . But the bodies are burned outside the camp .
NIRV	Hebrews	13	12	Jesus also suffered outside the city gate . He suffered to make the people holy by spilling his own blood .
NIRV	Hebrews	13	14	Here we do not have a city that lasts . But we are looking for the city that is going to come .
NIRV	Hebrews	13	15	So let us never stop offering to God our praise through Jesus . Let us talk openly about our faith in him . Then our words will be like an offering to God .
NIRV	Hebrews	13	16	Don ’ t forget to do good . Don ’ t forget to share with others . God is pleased with those kinds of offerings .
NIRV	Hebrews	13	17	Trust in your leaders . Put yourselves under their authority . Do this , because they keep watch over you . They know they are accountable to God for everything they do . Do this , so that their work will be a joy . If you make their work a heavy load , it won ’ t do you any good .
NIRV	Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us . We feel sure we have done what is right . We desire to live as we should in every way .
NIRV	Hebrews	13	19	I beg you to pray that I may return to you soon . Final Blessing and Greetings
NIRV	Hebrews	13	20	Our Lord Jesus is the great Shepherd of the sheep . The God who gives peace brought him back from the dead . He did it because of the blood of the eternal covenant . Now may God
NIRV	Hebrews	13	21	supply you with everything good . Then you can do what he wants . May he do in us what is pleasing to him . We can do it only with the help of Jesus Christ . Give him glory for ever and ever . Amen .
NIRV	Hebrews	13	22	Brothers and sisters , I beg you to accept my word . It tells you to be faithful . Accept my word because I have written to you only a short letter .
NIRV	Hebrews	13	23	I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been set free . If he arrives soon , I will come with him to see you .
NIRV	Hebrews	13	24	Greet all your leaders . Greet all the Lord ’ s people . The believers from Italy send you their greetings .

NIRV	James	1	12	Blessed is the person who keeps on going when times are hard . After they have come through hard times , this person will receive a crown . The crown is life itself . The Lord has promised it to those who love him .
NIRV	James	1	2	My brothers and sisters , you will face all kinds of trouble . When you do , think of it as pure joy .
NIRV	James	1	3	Your faith will be tested . You know that when this happens it will produce in you the strength to continue .
NIRV	James	1	4	And you must allow this strength to finish its work . Then you will be all you should be . You will have everything you need .
NIRV	James	1	5	If any of you needs wisdom , you should ask God for it . He will give it to you . God gives freely to everyone and doesn ’ t find fault .
NIRV	James	1	6	But when you ask , you must believe . You must not doubt . That ’ s because a person who doubts is like a wave of the sea . The wind blows and tosses them around .
NIRV	James	1	7	They shouldn ’ t expect to receive anything from the Lord .
NIRV	James	1	8	This kind of person can ’ t make up their mind . They can never decide what to do .
NIRV	James	1	9	Here ’ s what believers who are in low positions in life should be proud of . They should be proud that God has given them a high position in the kingdom .
NIRV	James	1	10	But rich people should take pride in their low positions . That ’ s because they will fade away like wild flowers .
NIRV	James	1	11	The sun rises . Its burning heat dries up the plants . Their blossoms fall . Their beauty is destroyed . In the same way , rich people will fade away . They fade away even as they go about their business .
NIRV	James	1	13	When a person is tempted , they shouldn ’ t say , “ God is tempting me. ” God can ’ t be tempted by evil . And he doesn ’ t tempt anyone .
NIRV	James	1	14	But each person is tempted by their own evil desires . These desires lead them on and drag them away .
NIRV	James	1	15	When these desires are allowed to remain , they lead to sin . And when sin is allowed to remain and grow , it leads to death .
NIRV	James	1	16	My dear brothers and sisters , don ’ t let anyone fool you .
NIRV	James	1	17	Every good and perfect gift is from God . This kind of gift comes down from the Father who created the heavenly lights . These lights create shadows that move . But the Father does not change like these shadows .
NIRV	James	1	18	God chose to give us new birth through the message of truth . He wanted us to be the first harvest of his new creation . Listen to the Word and Do What It Says
NIRV	James	1	19	My dear brothers and sisters , pay attention to what I say . Everyone should be quick to listen . But they should be slow to speak . They should be slow to get angry .
NIRV	James	1	20	Human anger doesn ’ t produce the holy life God wants .
NIRV	James	1	21	So get rid of everything that is sinful . Get rid of the evil that is all around us . Don ’ t be too proud to accept the word that is planted in you . It can save you .
NIRV	James	1	22	Don ’ t just listen to the word . You fool yourselves if you do that . You must do what it says .
NIRV	James	1	23	Suppose someone listens to the word but doesn ’ t do what it says . Then they are like a person who looks at their face in a mirror .
NIRV	James	1	24	After looking at themselves , they leave . And right away they forget what they look like .
NIRV	James	1	25	But suppose someone takes a good look at the perfect law that gives freedom . And they keep looking at it . Suppose they don ’ t forget what they ’ ve heard , but they do what the law says . Then this person will be blessed in what they do .
NIRV	James	1	26	Suppose people think their beliefs and how they live are both right . But they don ’ t control what they say . Then they are fooling themselves . Their beliefs and way of life are not worth anything at all .
NIRV	James	1	27	Here are the beliefs and way of life that God our Father accepts as pure and without fault . When widows are in trouble , take care of them . Do the same for children who have no parents . And don ’ t let the world make you impure . Copyright ©

NIRV	James	2	2	Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes . And suppose a poor man in dirty old clothes also comes in .
NIRV	James	2	3	Would you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes ? Would you say , “ Here ’ s a good seat for you ” ? Would you say to the poor man , “ You stand there ” ? Or “ Sit on the floor by my feet ” ?
NIRV	James	2	4	If you would , aren ’ t you treating some people better than others ? Aren ’ t you like judges who have evil thoughts ?
NIRV	James	2	5	My dear brothers and sisters , listen to me . Hasn ’ t God chosen those who are poor in the world ’ s eyes to be rich in faith ? Hasn ’ t he chosen them to receive the kingdom ? Hasn ’ t he promised it to those who love him ?
NIRV	James	2	6	But you have disrespected poor people . Aren ’ t rich people taking advantage of you ? Aren ’ t they dragging you into court ?
NIRV	James	2	7	Aren ’ t they speaking evil things against the worthy name of Jesus ? Remember , you belong to him .
NIRV	James	2	8	The royal law is found in Scripture . It says , “ Love your neighbor as you love yourself. ” ( Leviticus 19:18 ) If you really keep this law , you are doing what is right .
NIRV	James	2	9	But you sin if you don ’ t treat everyone the same . The law judges you because you have broken it .
NIRV	James	2	10	Suppose you keep the whole law but trip over just one part of it . Then you are guilty of breaking all of it .
NIRV	James	2	11	God said , “ Do not commit adultery. ” ( Exodus 20:14 ; Deuteronomy 5:18 ) He also said , “ Do not commit murder. ” ( Exodus 20:13 ; Deuteronomy 5:17 ) Suppose you don ’ t commit adultery but do commit murder . Then you have broken the law .
NIRV	James	2	12	Speak and act like people who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom .
NIRV	James	2	13	Those who have not shown mercy will not receive mercy when they are judged . To show mercy is better than to judge . Show Your Faith by What You Do
NIRV	James	2	14	Suppose a person claims to have faith but doesn ’ t act on their faith . My brothers and sisters , can this kind of faith save them ?
NIRV	James	2	15	Suppose a brother or a sister has no clothes or food .
NIRV	James	2	16	Suppose one of you says to them , “ Go . I hope everything turns out fine for you . Keep warm . Eat well. ” And suppose you do nothing about what they really need . Then what good have you done ?
NIRV	James	2	17	It is the same with faith . If it doesn ’ t cause us to do something , it ’ s dead .
NIRV	James	2	18	But someone will say , “ You have faith . I do good deeds. ” Show me your faith that doesn ’ t cause you to do good deeds . And I will show you my faith by the goods deeds I do .
NIRV	James	2	19	You believe there is one God . Good ! Even the demons believe that . And they tremble !
NIRV	James	2	20	You foolish person ! Do you want proof that faith without good deeds is useless ?
NIRV	James	2	21	Our father Abraham offered his son Isaac on the altar . Wasn ’ t he considered to be right with God because of what he did ?
NIRV	James	2	22	So you see that what he believed and what he did were working together . What he did made his faith complete .
NIRV	James	2	23	That is what Scripture means where it says , “ Abraham believed God . God accepted Abraham because he believed . So his faith made him right with God. ” ( Genesis 15:6 ) And that ’ s not all . God called Abraham his friend .
NIRV	James	2	24	So you see that a person is considered right with God by what they do . It doesn ’ t happen only because they believe .
NIRV	James	2	25	Didn ’ t God consider even Rahab the prostitute to be right with him ? That ’ s because of what she did for the spies . She gave them a place to stay . Then she sent them off in a different direction .
NIRV	James	2	26	A person ’ s body without their spirit is dead . In the same way , faith without good deeds is dead . Copyright ©

NIRV	James	3	3	We put a small piece of metal in the mouth of a horse to make it obey us . We can control the whole animal with it .
NIRV	James	3	2	All of us get tripped up in many ways . Suppose someone is never wrong in what they say . Then they are perfect . They are able to keep their whole body under control .
NIRV	James	3	4	And how about ships ? They are very big . They are driven along by strong winds . But they are steered by a very small rudder . It makes them go where the captain wants to go .
NIRV	James	3	5	In the same way , the tongue is a small part of a person ’ s body . But it talks big . Think about how a small spark can set a big forest on fire .
NIRV	James	3	6	The tongue is also a fire . The tongue is the most evil part of the body . It makes the whole body impure . It sets a person ’ s whole way of life on fire . And the tongue itself is set on fire by hell .
NIRV	James	3	7	People have tamed all kinds of wild animals , birds , reptiles and sea creatures . And they still tame them .
NIRV	James	3	8	But no one can tame the tongue . It is an evil thing that never rests . It is full of deadly poison .
NIRV	James	3	9	With our tongues we praise our Lord and Father . With our tongues we curse people . We do it even though people have been created to be like God .
NIRV	James	3	10	Praise and cursing come out of the same mouth . My brothers and sisters , it shouldn ’ t be this way .
NIRV	James	3	11	Can fresh water and salt water flow out of the same spring ?
NIRV	James	3	12	My brothers and sisters , can a fig tree produce olives ? Can a grapevine produce figs ? Of course not . And a saltwater spring can ’ t produce fresh water either . Two Kinds of Wisdom
NIRV	James	3	13	Is anyone among you wise and understanding ? That person should show it by living a good life . A wise person isn ’ t proud when they do good deeds .
NIRV	James	3	14	But suppose your hearts are jealous and bitter . Suppose you are concerned only about getting ahead . Then don ’ t brag about it . And don ’ t say no to the truth .
NIRV	James	3	15	Wisdom like this doesn ’ t come down from heaven . It belongs to the earth . It doesn ’ t come from the Holy Spirit . It comes from the devil .
NIRV	James	3	16	Are you jealous ? Are you concerned only about getting ahead ? Then your life will be a mess . You will be doing all kinds of evil things .
NIRV	James	3	17	But the wisdom that comes from heaven is pure . That ’ s the most important thing about it . And that ’ s not all . It also loves peace . It thinks about others . It obeys . It is full of mercy and good fruit . It is fair . It doesn ’ t pretend to be what it is not .
NIRV	James	3	18	Those who make peace plant it like a seed . They will harvest a crop of right living . Copyright ©

NIRV	James	4	4	You are not faithful to God . Don ’ t you know that to be a friend of the world is to hate God ? So anyone who chooses to be the world ’ s friend becomes God ’ s enemy .
NIRV	James	4	2	You want something , but you don ’ t have it . So you kill . You want what others have , but you can ’ t get what you want . So you argue and fight . You don ’ t have what you want , because you don ’ t ask God .
NIRV	James	4	3	When you do ask for something , you don ’ t receive it . That ’ s because you ask for the wrong reason . You want to spend your money on your sinful pleasures .
NIRV	James	4	5	Don ’ t you know what Scripture says ? God wants the spirit in us to belong only to him . God caused this spirit to live in us . Don ’ t you think Scripture has a reason for saying this ?
NIRV	James	4	6	But God continues to give us more grace . That ’ s why Scripture says , “ God opposes those who are proud . But he gives grace to those who are humble. ” ( Proverbs 3:34 )
NIRV	James	4	7	So obey God . Stand up to the devil . He will run away from you .
NIRV	James	4	8	Come near to God , and he will come near to you . Wash your hands , you sinners . Make your hearts pure , you who can ’ t make up your minds .
NIRV	James	4	9	Be full of sorrow . Cry and weep . Change your laughter to mourning . Change your joy to sadness .
NIRV	James	4	10	Be humble in front of the Lord . And he will lift you up .
NIRV	James	4	11	My brothers and sisters , don ’ t speak against one another . Anyone who speaks against a brother or sister speaks against the law . And anyone who judges another believer judges the law . When you judge the law , you are not keeping it . Instead , you are acting as if you were its judge .
NIRV	James	4	12	There is only one Lawgiver and Judge . He is the God who is able to save life or destroy it . But who are you to judge your neighbor ? Bragging About Tomorrow
NIRV	James	4	13	Now listen , you who say , “ Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city . We will spend a year there . We will buy and sell and make money. ”
NIRV	James	4	14	You don ’ t even know what will happen tomorrow . What is your life ? It is a mist that appears for a little while . Then it disappears .
NIRV	James	4	15	Instead , you should say , “ If it pleases the Lord , we will live and do this or that. ”
NIRV	James	4	16	As it is , you brag . You brag about the evil plans your pride produces . This kind of bragging is evil .
NIRV	James	4	17	So suppose someone knows the good deeds they should do . But suppose they don ’ t do them . By not doing these good deeds , they sin . Copyright ©

NIRV	James	5	5	You have lived an easy life on earth . You have given yourselves everything you wanted . You have made yourselves fat like cattle that will soon be butchered .
NIRV	James	5	2	Your riches have rotted . Moths have eaten your clothes .
NIRV	James	5	3	Your gold and silver have lost their brightness . Their dullness will be a witness against you . Your wanting more and more will eat your body like fire . You have stored up riches in these last days .
NIRV	James	5	4	You have even failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields . Their pay is crying out against you . The cries of those who gathered the harvest have reached the ears of the Lord . He rules over all .
NIRV	James	5	6	You have judged and murdered people who aren ’ t guilty . And they weren ’ t even opposing you . Be Patient When You Suffer
NIRV	James	5	7	Brothers and sisters , be patient until the Lord comes . See how the farmer waits for the land to produce its rich crop . See how patient the farmer is for the fall and spring rains .
NIRV	James	5	8	You too must be patient . You must remain strong . The Lord will soon come back .
NIRV	James	5	9	Brothers and sisters , don ’ t find fault with one another . If you do , you will be judged . And the Judge is standing at the door !
NIRV	James	5	10	Brothers and sisters , think about the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord . They are an example of how to be patient when you suffer .
NIRV	James	5	11	As you know , we think that people who don ’ t give up are blessed . You have heard that Job was patient . And you have seen what the Lord finally did for him . The Lord is full of tender mercy and loving concern .
NIRV	James	5	12	My brothers and sisters , here is what is most important . Don ’ t make a promise by giving your word . Don ’ t promise by heaven or earth . And don ’ t promise by anything else to back up what you say . All you need to say is a simple “ Yes ” or “ No. ” If you do more than this , you will be judged . The Prayer of Faith
NIRV	James	5	13	Is anyone among you in trouble ? Then that person should pray . Is anyone among you happy ? Then that person should sing songs of praise .
NIRV	James	5	14	Is anyone among you sick ? Then that person should send for the elders of the church to pray over them . They should ask the elders to anoint them with olive oil in the name of the Lord .
NIRV	James	5	15	The prayer offered by those who have faith will make the sick person well . The Lord will heal them . If they have sinned , they will be forgiven .
NIRV	James	5	16	So confess your sins to one another . Pray for one another so that you might be healed . The prayer of a godly person is powerful . Things happen because of it .
NIRV	James	5	17	Elijah was a human being , just as we are . He prayed hard that it wouldn ’ t rain . And it didn ’ t rain on the land for three and a half years .
NIRV	James	5	18	Then he prayed again . That time it rained . And the earth produced its crops .
NIRV	James	5	19	My brothers and sisters , suppose one of you wanders away from the truth . And suppose someone brings that person back .
NIRV	James	5	20	Then here is what I want you to remember . Anyone who keeps a sinner from going astray will save them from death . God will erase many sins by forgiving them . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Peter	1	1	I , Peter , am writing this letter . I am an apostle of Jesus Christ . I am sending this letter to you , God ’ s chosen people . You are people who have had to wander in the world . You are scattered all over the areas of Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia and Bithynia .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	2	You have been chosen in keeping with what God the Father had planned . That happened through the Spirit ’ s work to make you pure and holy . God chose you so that you might obey Jesus Christ . God wanted you to be in a covenant relationship with him . He established this relationship by the blood of Christ . May more and more grace and peace be given to you . Peter Praises God for a Living Hope
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	3	Give praise to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . In his great mercy he has given us a new birth and a living hope . This hope is living because Jesus Christ rose from the dead .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	4	He has given us new birth so that we might share in what belongs to him . This is a gift that can never be destroyed . It can never spoil or even fade away . It is kept in heaven for you .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	5	Through faith you are kept safe by God ’ s power . Your salvation is going to be completed . It is ready to be shown to you in the last days .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	6	Because you know all this , you have great joy . You have joy even though you may have had to suffer for a little while . You may have had to suffer sadness in all kinds of trouble .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	7	Your troubles have come in order to prove that your faith is real . Your faith is worth more than gold . That ’ s because gold can pass away even when fire has made it pure . Your faith is meant to bring praise , honor and glory to God . This will happen when Jesus Christ returns .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	8	Even though you have not seen him , you love him . Though you do not see him now , you believe in him . You are filled with a glorious joy that can ’ t be put into words .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	9	You are receiving the salvation of your souls . This salvation is the final result of your faith .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	10	The prophets searched very hard and with great care to find out about this salvation . They spoke about the grace that was going to come to you .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	11	They wanted to find out when and how this salvation would come . The Spirit of Christ in them was telling them about the sufferings of the Messiah . These were his sufferings that were going to come . The Spirit of Christ was also telling them about the glory that would follow .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	12	It was made known to the prophets that they were not serving themselves . Instead , they were serving you when they spoke about the things that you have now heard . Those who have preached the good news to you have told you these things . They have done it with the help of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven . Even angels long to look into these things . Be Holy
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	13	So be watchful , and control yourselves completely . In this way , put your hope in the grace that lies ahead . This grace will be brought to you when Jesus Christ returns .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	14	You should obey your Father . You shouldn ’ t give in to evil desires . They controlled your life when you didn ’ t know any better .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	15	The God who chose you is holy . So you should be holy in all that you do .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	16	It is written , “ Be holy , because I am holy. ” ( Leviticus 11:44,45 ; 19:2 )
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	17	You call on a Father who judges each person ’ s work without favoring one over another . So live as outsiders during your time here . Live with the highest respect for God .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	18	You were set free from an empty way of life . This way of life was handed down to you by your own people of long ago . You know that you were not bought with things that can pass away , like silver or gold .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	19	Instead , you were bought with the priceless blood of Christ . He is a perfect lamb . He doesn ’ t have any flaws at all .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	20	He was chosen before God created the world . But he came into the world for your sake in these last days .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	21	Because of what Christ has done , you believe in God . It was God who raised him from the dead . And it was God who gave him glory . So your faith and hope are in God .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	22	You have made yourselves pure by obeying the truth . So you have an honest and true love for each other . So love one another deeply , from your hearts .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	23	You have been born again by means of the living word of God . His word lasts forever . You were not born again from a seed that will die . You were born from a seed that can ’ t die .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	24	It is written , “ All people are like grass . All their glory is like the flowers in the field . The grass dries up . The flowers fall to the ground .
NIRV	1%20Peter	1	25	But the word of the Lord lasts forever. ” ( Isaiah 40:6–8 ) And this is the word that was preached to you . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Peter	2	1	Peter
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	2	Like newborn babies , you should long for the pure milk of God ’ s word . It will help you grow up as believers .
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	3	You can do this now that you have tasted how good the Lord is . The Living Stone and a Chosen People
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	4	Christ is the living Stone . People did not accept him , but God chose him . God places the highest value on him .
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	5	You also are like living stones . As you come to Christ , you are being built into a house for worship . There you will be holy priests . You will offer spiritual sacrifices . God will accept them because of what Jesus Christ has done .
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	6	In Scripture it says , “ Look ! I am placing a stone in Zion . It is a chosen and very valuable stone . It is the most important stone in the building . The one who trusts in him will never be put to shame. ” ( Isaiah 28:16 )
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	7	This stone is very valuable to you who believe . But to people who do not believe , “ The stone the builders did not accept has become the most important stone of all. ” ( Psalm 118:22 )
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	8	And , “ It is a stone that causes people to trip . It is a rock that makes them fall. ” ( Isaiah 8:14 ) They trip and fall because they do not obey the message . That is also what God planned for them .
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	9	But God chose you to be his people . You are royal priests . You are a holy nation . You are God ’ s special treasure . You are all these things so that you can give him praise . God brought you out of darkness into his wonderful light .
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	10	Once you were not a people . But now you are the people of God . Once you had not received mercy . But now you have received mercy . Living Godly Lives Among People Who Don ’ t Believe
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	11	Dear friends , you are outsiders and those who wander in this world . So I ’ m asking you not to give in to your sinful desires . They fight against your soul .
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	12	People who don ’ t believe might say you are doing wrong . But lead good lives among them . Then they will see your good deeds . And they will give glory to God on the day he comes to judge .
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	13	Follow the lead of every human authority . Do this for the Lord ’ s sake . Obey the emperor . He is the highest authority .
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	14	Obey the governors . The emperor sends them to punish those who do wrong . He also sends them to praise those who do right .
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	15	By doing good you will put a stop to the talk of foolish people . They don ’ t know what they are saying .
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	16	Live as free people . But don ’ t use your freedom to cover up evil . Live as people who are God ’ s slaves .
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	17	Show proper respect to everyone . Love the family of believers . Have respect for God . Honor the emperor .
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	18	Slaves , obey your masters out of deep respect for God . Obey not only those who are good and kind . Obey also those who are not kind .
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	19	Suppose a person suffers pain unfairly because they want to obey God . This is worthy of praise .
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	20	But suppose you receive a beating for doing wrong , and you put up with it . Will anyone honor you for this ? Of course not . But suppose you suffer for doing good , and you put up with it . God will praise you for this .
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	21	You were chosen to do good even if you suffer . That ’ s because Christ suffered for you . He left you an example that he expects you to follow .
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	22	Scripture says , “ He didn ’ t commit any sin . No lies ever came out of his mouth. ” ( Isaiah 53:9 )
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	23	People shouted at him and made fun of him . But he didn ’ t do the same thing back to them . When he suffered , he didn ’ t say he would make them suffer . Instead , he trusted in the God who judges fairly .
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	24	“ He himself carried our sins ” in his body on the cross . ( Isaiah 53:5 ) He did it so that we would die as far as sins are concerned . Then we would lead godly lives . “ His wounds have healed you. ” ( Isaiah 53:5 )
NIRV	1%20Peter	2	25	“ You were like sheep wandering away. ” ( Isaiah 53:6 ) But now you have returned to the Shepherd . He is the one who watches over your souls . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Peter	3	3	Fancy hairstyles don ’ t make you beautiful . Wearing gold jewelry or fine clothes doesn ’ t make you beautiful .
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	2	Let them see how pure you are . Let them see that your lives are full of respect for God .
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	4	Instead , your beauty comes from inside you . It is the beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit . Beauty like this doesn ’ t fade away . God places great value on it .
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	5	This is how the holy women of the past used to make themselves beautiful . They put their hope in God . And they followed the lead of their own husbands .
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	6	Sarah was like that . She obeyed Abraham . She called him her master . Do you want to be like her ? Then do what is right . And don ’ t give in to fear .
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	7	Husbands , consider the needs of your wives . They are weaker than you . So treat them with respect . Honor them as those who will share with you the gracious gift of life . Then nothing will stand in the way of your prayers . Suffering for Doing Good
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	8	Finally , I want all of you to agree with one another . Be understanding . Love one another . Be kind and tender . Be humble .
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	9	Don ’ t pay back evil with evil . Don ’ t pay back unkind words with unkind words . Instead , pay back evil with kind words . This is what you have been chosen to do . You will receive a blessing by doing this .
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	10	Scripture says , “ Suppose someone wants to love life and see good days . Then they must keep their tongues from speaking evil . They must keep their lips from telling lies .
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	11	They must turn away from evil and do good . They must look for peace and go after it .
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	12	The Lord ’ s eyes look on godly people , and he blesses them . His ears are open to their prayers . But the Lord doesn ’ t bless those who do evil. ” ( Psalm 34:12–16 )
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	13	Who is going to hurt you if you really want to do good ?
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	14	But suppose you do suffer for doing what is right . Even then you will be blessed . Scripture says , “ Don ’ t fear what others say they will do to hurt you . Don ’ t be afraid. ” ( Isaiah 8:12 )
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	15	But make sure that in your hearts you honor Christ as Lord . Always be ready to give an answer to anyone who asks you about the hope you have . Be ready to give the reason for it . But do it gently and with respect .
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	16	Live so that you don ’ t have to feel you ’ ve done anything wrong . Some people may say evil things about your good conduct as believers in Christ . If they do , they will be put to shame for speaking like this about you .
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	17	God may want you to suffer for doing good . That ’ s better than suffering for doing evil .
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	18	Christ also suffered once for sins . The one who did what is right suffered for those who don ’ t do right . He suffered to bring you to God . His body was put to death . But the Holy Spirit brought him back to life .
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	19	After that , Christ went and made an announcement to the spirits in prison .
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	20	Long ago these spirits did not obey . That was when God was patient while Noah was building the ark . And only a few people went into the ark . In fact , there were only eight . Those eight people were saved through water .
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	21	The water of the flood is a picture . It is a picture of the baptism that now saves you too . This baptism has nothing to do with removing dirt from your body . Instead , it promises God that you will keep a clear sense of right and wrong . This baptism saves you by the same power that raised Jesus Christ from the dead .
NIRV	1%20Peter	3	22	He has gone into heaven . He is at God ’ s right hand . Angels , authorities and powers are under his control . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Peter	4	1	Peter
NIRV	1%20Peter	4	4	Ungodly people are surprised that you no longer join them in what they do . They want you to join them in their wild and wasteful living . So they say bad things about you .
NIRV	1%20Peter	4	2	As a result , they don ’ t live the rest of their earthly life for evil human desires . Instead , they live to do what God wants .
NIRV	1%20Peter	4	3	You have spent enough time in the past doing what ungodly people choose to do . You lived a wild life . You longed for evil things . You got drunk . You went to wild parties . You worshiped statues of gods , which the Lord hates .
NIRV	1%20Peter	4	5	But they will have to explain their actions to God . He is ready to judge those who are alive and those who are dead .
NIRV	1%20Peter	4	6	That ’ s why the good news was preached even to people who are now dead . It was preached to them for two reasons . It was preached so that their bodies might be judged . This judgment is made by human standards . But the good news was also preached so that their spirits might live . This life comes by means of God ’ s power .
NIRV	1%20Peter	4	7	The end of all things is near . So be watchful and control yourselves . Then you may pray .
NIRV	1%20Peter	4	8	Most of all , love one another deeply . Love erases many sins by forgiving them .
NIRV	1%20Peter	4	9	Welcome others into your homes without complaining .
NIRV	1%20Peter	4	10	God ’ s gifts of grace come in many forms . Each of you has received a gift in order to serve others . You should use it faithfully .
NIRV	1%20Peter	4	11	If anyone speaks , they should do it as one speaking God ’ s words . If anyone serves , they should do it with the strength God provides . Then in all things God will be praised through Jesus Christ . Glory and power belong to him for ever and ever . Amen . Suffering for Being a Christian
NIRV	1%20Peter	4	12	Dear friends , don ’ t be surprised by the terrible things happening to you . The trouble you are having has come to test you . So don ’ t feel as if something strange were happening to you .
NIRV	1%20Peter	4	13	Instead , be joyful that you are taking part in Christ ’ s sufferings . Then you will have even more joy when Christ returns in glory .
NIRV	1%20Peter	4	14	Suppose people say bad things about you because you believe in Christ . Then you are blessed , because God ’ s Spirit rests on you . He is the Spirit of glory .
NIRV	1%20Peter	4	15	If you suffer , it shouldn ’ t be because you are a murderer . It shouldn ’ t be because you are a thief or someone who does evil things . It shouldn ’ t be because you interfere with other people ’ s business .
NIRV	1%20Peter	4	16	But suppose you suffer for being a Christian . Then don ’ t be ashamed . Instead , praise God because you are known by the name of Christ .
NIRV	1%20Peter	4	17	It is time for judgment to begin with the household of God . And since it begins with us , what will happen to people who don ’ t obey God ’ s good news ?
NIRV	1%20Peter	4	18	Scripture says , “ Suppose it is hard for godly people to be saved . Then what will happen to ungodly people and sinners ? ” ( Proverbs 11:31 )
NIRV	1%20Peter	4	19	Here is what people who suffer because of God ’ s plan should do . They should commit themselves to their faithful Creator . And they should continue to do good . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Peter	5	1	Peter
NIRV	1%20Peter	5	5	In the same way , I ’ m speaking to you who are younger . Follow the lead of those who are older . All of you , put on a spirit free of pride toward one another . Put it on as if it were your clothes . Do this because Scripture says , “ God opposes those who are proud . But he gives grace to those who are humble. ” ( Proverbs 3:34 )
NIRV	1%20Peter	5	2	Be shepherds of God ’ s flock , the believers under your care . Watch over them , though not because you have to . Instead , do it because you want to . That ’ s what God wants you to do . Don ’ t do it because you want to get money in dishonest ways . Do it because you really want to serve .
NIRV	1%20Peter	5	3	Don ’ t act as if you were a ruler over those under your care . Instead , be examples to the flock .
NIRV	1%20Peter	5	4	The Chief Shepherd will come again . Then you will receive the crown of glory . It is a crown that will never fade away .
NIRV	1%20Peter	5	6	So make yourselves humble . Put yourselves under God ’ s mighty hand . Then he will honor you at the right time .
NIRV	1%20Peter	5	7	Turn all your worries over to him . He cares about you .
NIRV	1%20Peter	5	8	Be watchful and control yourselves . Your enemy the devil is like a roaring lion . He prowls around looking for someone to swallow up .
NIRV	1%20Peter	5	9	Stand up to him . Remain strong in what you believe . You know that you are not alone in your suffering . The family of believers throughout the world is going through the same thing .
NIRV	1%20Peter	5	10	God always gives you all the grace you need . So you will only have to suffer for a little while . Then God himself will build you up again . He will make you strong and steady . And he has chosen you to share in his eternal glory because you belong to Christ .
NIRV	1%20Peter	5	11	Give him the power for ever and ever . Amen . Final Greetings
NIRV	1%20Peter	5	12	I consider Silas to be a faithful brother . With his help I have written you this short letter . I have written it to encourage you . And I have written to speak the truth about the true grace of God . Remain strong in it .
NIRV	1%20Peter	5	13	The members of the church in Babylon send you their greetings . They were chosen together with you . Mark , my son in the faith , also sends you his greetings .
NIRV	1%20Peter	5	14	Greet each other with a kiss of friendship . May God give peace to all of you who believe in Christ . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Peter	1	2	May more and more grace and peace be given to you . May they come to you as you learn more about God and about Jesus our Lord . Showing That God Has Chosen You
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	1	I , Simon Peter , am writing this letter . I serve Jesus Christ . I am his apostle . I am sending this letter to you . You are those who have received a faith as valuable as ours . You received it because our God and Savior Jesus Christ does what is right .
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	3	God ’ s power has given us everything we need to lead a godly life . All of this has come to us because we know the God who chose us . He chose us because of his own glory and goodness .
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	4	He has also given us his very great and valuable promises . He did it so you could share in his nature . You can share in it because you ’ ve escaped from the evil in the world . This evil is caused by sinful desires .
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	5	So you should try very hard to add goodness to your faith . To goodness , add knowledge .
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	6	To knowledge , add the ability to control yourselves . To the ability to control yourselves , add the strength to keep going . To the strength to keep going , add godliness .
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	7	To godliness , add kindness for one another . And to kindness for one another , add love .
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	8	All these things should describe you more and more . They will make you useful and fruitful as you know our Lord Jesus Christ better .
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	9	But what if these things don ’ t describe someone at all ? Then that person can ’ t see very well . In fact , they are blind . They have forgotten that their past sins have been washed away .
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	10	My brothers and sisters , try very hard to show that God has appointed you to be saved . Try hard to show that he has chosen you . If you do everything I have just said , you will never trip and fall .
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	11	You will receive a rich welcome into the kingdom that lasts forever . It is the kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . Prophecy of Scripture Comes From God
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	12	So I will always remind you of these things . I ’ ll do it even though you know them . I ’ ll do it even though you now have deep roots in the truth .
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	13	I think it is right for me to remind you . It is right as long as I live in this tent . I ’ m talking about my body .
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	14	I know my tent will soon be removed . Our Lord Jesus Christ has made that clear to me .
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	15	I hope that you will always be able to remember these things after I ’ m gone . I will try very hard to see that you do .
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	16	We told you about the time our Lord Jesus Christ came with power . But we didn ’ t make up clever stories when we told you about it . With our own eyes we saw him in all his majesty .
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	17	God the Father gave him honor and glory . The voice of the Majestic Glory came to him . It said , “ This is my Son , and I love him . I am very pleased with him. ” ( Matthew 17:5 ; Mark 9:7 ; Luke 9:35 )
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	18	We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven . We were with him on the sacred mountain .
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	19	We also have the message of the prophets . This message can be trusted completely . You must pay attention to it . The message is like a light shining in a dark place . It will shine until the day Jesus comes . Then the Morning Star will rise in your hearts .
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	20	Above all , here is what you must understand . No prophecy in Scripture ever came from a prophet ’ s own understanding of things .
NIRV	2%20Peter	1	21	Prophecy never came simply because a prophet wanted it to . Instead , the Holy Spirit guided the prophets as they spoke . So , although prophets are human , prophecy comes from God . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Peter	2	2	Many people will follow their lead . These people will do the same evil things the false teachers do . They will cause people to think badly about the way of truth .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	3	These teachers are never satisfied . They want to get something out of you . So they make up stories to take advantage of you . They have been under a sentence of death for a long time . The God who will destroy them has not been sleeping .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	4	God did not spare angels when they sinned . Instead , he sent them to hell . He chained them up in dark prisons . He will keep them there until he judges them .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	5	God did not spare the world ’ s ungodly people long ago . He brought the flood on them . But Noah preached about the right way to live . God kept him safe . He also saved seven others .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	6	God judged the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah . He burned them to ashes . He made them an example of what is going to happen to ungodly people .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	7	God saved Lot , a man who did what was right . Lot was shocked by the evil conduct of people who didn ’ t obey God ’ s laws .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	8	That good man lived among them day after day . He saw and heard the evil things they were doing . They were breaking God ’ s laws . And the godly spirit of Lot was deeply troubled .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	9	Since all this is true , then the Lord knows how to save godly people . He knows how to keep them safe in times of testing . The Lord also knows how to keep ungodly people under guard . He will do so until the day they will be judged and punished .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	10	Most of all , this is true of people who follow desires that come from sin ’ s power . These people hate to be under authority . They are bold and proud . So they aren ’ t even afraid to speak evil things against heavenly beings .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	11	Now angels are stronger and more powerful than these people . But even angels don ’ t speak evil things against heavenly beings . They don ’ t do this when they bring judgment on them from the Lord .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	12	These people speak evil about things they don ’ t understand . They are like wild animals who can ’ t think . Instead , they do what comes naturally to them . They are born only to be caught and destroyed . Just like animals , these people too will die .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	13	They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done . Their idea of pleasure is to have wild parties in the middle of the day . They are like dirty spots and stains . They enjoy their sinful pleasures while they eat with you .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	14	They stare at women who are not their wives . They want to sleep with them . They never stop sinning . They trap those who are not firm in their faith . They have mastered the art of getting what they want . God has placed them under his judgment .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	15	They have left God ’ s way . They have wandered off . They follow the way of Balaam , son of Beor . He loved to get paid for doing his evil work .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	16	But a donkey corrected him for the wrong he did . Animals don ’ t speak . But the donkey spoke with a human voice . It tried to stop the prophet from doing a very dumb thing .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	17	These people are like springs without water . They are like mists driven by a storm . The blackest darkness is reserved for them .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	18	They speak empty , bragging words . They make their appeal to the evil desires that come from sin ’ s power . They tempt new believers who are just escaping from the company of sinful people .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	19	They promise to give freedom to these new believers . But they themselves are slaves to sinful living . That ’ s because “ people are slaves to anything that controls them. ”
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	20	They may have escaped the sin of the world . They may have come to know our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . But what if they are once again caught up in sin ? And what if it has become their master ? Then they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	21	Suppose they had not known the way of godliness . This would have been better than to know godliness and then turn away from it . The way of godliness is the sacred command passed on to them .
NIRV	2%20Peter	2	22	What the proverbs say about them is true . “ A dog returns to where it has thrown up. ” ( Proverbs 26:11 ) And , “ A pig that is washed goes back to rolling in the mud. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Peter	3	2	I want you to remember the words the holy prophets spoke in the past . Remember the command our Lord and Savior gave through your apostles .
NIRV	2%20Peter	3	3	Most of all , here is what you must understand . In the last days people will make fun of the truth . They will laugh at it . They will follow their own evil desires .
NIRV	2%20Peter	3	4	They will say , “ Where is this ‘ return ’ he promised ? Everything goes on in the same way it has since our people of long ago died . In fact , it has continued this way since God first created everything. ”
NIRV	2%20Peter	3	5	Long ago , God ’ s word brought the heavens into being . His word separated the earth from the waters . And the waters surrounded it . But these people forget things like that on purpose .
NIRV	2%20Peter	3	6	The waters also flooded the world of that time . And so they destroyed the world .
NIRV	2%20Peter	3	7	By God ’ s word the heavens and earth of today are being reserved for fire . They are being kept for the day when God will judge . Then ungodly people will be destroyed .
NIRV	2%20Peter	3	8	Dear friends , here is one thing you must not forget . With the Lord a day is like a thousand years . And a thousand years are like a day .
NIRV	2%20Peter	3	9	The Lord is not slow to keep his promise . He is not slow in the way some people understand it . Instead , he is patient with you . He doesn ’ t want anyone to be destroyed . Instead , he wants all people to turn away from their sins .
NIRV	2%20Peter	3	10	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief . The heavens will disappear with a roar . Fire will destroy everything in them . God will judge the earth and everything done in it .
NIRV	2%20Peter	3	11	So everything will be destroyed in this way . And what kind of people should you be ? You should lead holy and godly lives .
NIRV	2%20Peter	3	12	Live like this as you look forward to the day of God . Living like this will make the day come more quickly . On that day fire will destroy the heavens . Its heat will melt everything in them .
NIRV	2%20Peter	3	13	But we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth . Godliness will live there . All this is in keeping with God ’ s promise .
NIRV	2%20Peter	3	14	Dear friends , I know you are looking forward to this . So try your best to be found pure and without blame . Be at peace with God .
NIRV	2%20Peter	3	15	Remember that while our Lord is waiting patiently to return , people are being saved . Our dear brother Paul also wrote to you about this . God made him wise to write as he did .
NIRV	2%20Peter	3	16	Paul writes the same way in all his letters . He speaks about what I have just told you . His letters include some things that are hard to understand . People who don ’ t know better and aren ’ t firm in the faith twist what he says . They twist the other Scriptures too . So they will be destroyed .
NIRV	2%20Peter	3	17	Dear friends , you have already been warned about this . So be on your guard . Then you won ’ t be led astray by people who don ’ t obey the law . Instead , you will remain safe .
NIRV	2%20Peter	3	18	Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . Glory belongs to him both now and forever . Amen . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20John	1	6	Suppose we say that we share life with God but still walk in the darkness . Then we are lying . We are not living out the truth .

NIRV	1%20John	1	8	Suppose we claim we are without sin . Then we are fooling ourselves . The truth is not in us .

NIRV	1%20John	2	3	We know that we have come to know God if we obey his commands .
NIRV	1%20John	2	4	Suppose someone says , “ I know him. ” But suppose this person does not do what God commands . Then this person is a liar and is not telling the truth .
NIRV	1%20John	2	5	But if anyone obeys God ’ s word , then that person truly loves God . Here is how we know we belong to him .
NIRV	1%20John	2	6	Those who claim to belong to him must live just as Jesus did .
NIRV	1%20John	2	7	Dear friends , I ’ m not writing you a new command . Instead , I ’ m writing one you have heard before . You have had it since the beginning .
NIRV	1%20John	2	8	But I am writing what amounts to a new command . Its truth was shown in how Jesus lived . It is also shown in how you live . That ’ s because the darkness is passing away . And the true light is already shining .
NIRV	1%20John	2	9	Suppose someone claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister . Then they are still in the darkness .
NIRV	1%20John	2	10	Anyone who loves their brother and sister lives in the light . There is nothing in them to make them fall into sin .
NIRV	1%20John	2	11	But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness . They walk around in the darkness . They don ’ t know where they are going . The darkness has made them blind . Reasons for Writing

NIRV	1%20John	2	15	Do not love the world or anything in it . If anyone loves the world , love for the Father is not in them .
NIRV	1%20John	2	16	Here is what people who belong to this world do . They try to satisfy what their sinful desires want to do . They long for what their sinful eyes look at . They take pride in what they have and what they do . All of this comes from the world . None of it comes from the Father .
NIRV	1%20John	2	17	The world and its evil desires are passing away . But whoever does what God wants them to do lives forever . Warnings About Saying No to the Son
NIRV	1%20John	2	18	Dear children , we are living in the last days . You have heard that the great enemy of Christ is coming . But even now many enemies of Christ have already come . That ’ s how we know that these are the last days .
NIRV	1%20John	2	19	These enemies left our community of believers . They didn ’ t really belong to us . If they had belonged to us , they would have remained with us . But by leaving they showed that none of them belonged to us .
NIRV	1%20John	2	20	You have received the Spirit from the Holy One . And all of you know the truth .
NIRV	1%20John	2	21	I ’ m not writing to you because you don ’ t know the truth . I ’ m writing because you do know it . I ’ m writing to you because no lie comes from the truth .
NIRV	1%20John	2	22	Who is the liar ? It is anyone who says that Jesus is not the Christ . The person who says this is the great enemy of Christ . They say no to the Father and the Son .
NIRV	1%20John	2	23	The person who says no to the Son doesn ’ t belong to the Father . But anyone who says yes to the Son belongs to the Father also .
NIRV	1%20John	2	24	Make sure that you don ’ t forget what you have heard from the beginning . Then you will remain joined to the Son and to the Father .
NIRV	1%20John	2	25	And here is what God has promised us . He has promised us eternal life .

NIRV	1%20John	3	4	Everyone who sins breaks the law . In fact , breaking the law is sin .
NIRV	1%20John	3	5	But you know that Christ came to take our sins away . And there is no sin in him .
NIRV	1%20John	3	6	No one who remains joined to him keeps on sinning . No one who keeps on sinning has seen him or known him .
NIRV	1%20John	3	7	Dear children , don ’ t let anyone lead you astray . The person who does what is right is holy , just as Christ is holy .
NIRV	1%20John	3	8	The person who does what is sinful belongs to the devil . That ’ s because the devil has been sinning from the beginning . But the Son of God came to destroy the devil ’ s work .
NIRV	1%20John	3	9	Those who are God ’ s children will not keep on sinning . God ’ s very nature remains in them . They can ’ t go on sinning . That ’ s because they are God ’ s children .
NIRV	1%20John	3	10	Here is how you can tell the difference between God ’ s children and the devil ’ s children . Anyone who doesn ’ t do what is right isn ’ t God ’ s child . And anyone who doesn ’ t love their brother or sister isn ’ t God ’ s child either . More Instructions About Loving and Hating One Another
NIRV	1%20John	3	11	From the beginning we have heard that we should love one another .
NIRV	1%20John	3	12	Don ’ t be like Cain . He belonged to the evil one . He murdered his brother . And why did he murder him ? Because the things Cain had done were wrong . But the things his brother had done were right .
NIRV	1%20John	3	13	My brothers and sisters , don ’ t be surprised if the world hates you .
NIRV	1%20John	3	14	We know that we have left our old dead way of life . And we have entered into new life . We know this because we love one another . Anyone who doesn ’ t love still lives in their old condition .
NIRV	1%20John	3	15	Anyone who hates their brother or sister is a murderer . And you know that no murderer has eternal life .
NIRV	1%20John	3	16	We know what love is because Jesus Christ gave his life for us . So we should give our lives for our brothers and sisters .
NIRV	1%20John	3	17	Suppose someone sees a brother or sister in need and is able to help them . And suppose that person doesn ’ t take pity on these needy people . Then how can the love of God be in that person ?
NIRV	1%20John	3	18	Dear children , don ’ t just talk about love . Put your love into action . Then it will truly be love .
NIRV	1%20John	3	19	Here ’ s how we know that we hold to the truth . And here ’ s how we put our hearts at rest , knowing that God is watching .
NIRV	1%20John	3	20	If our hearts judge us , we know that God is greater than our hearts . And he knows everything .
NIRV	1%20John	3	21	Dear friends , if our hearts do not judge us , we can be bold with God .
NIRV	1%20John	3	22	And he will give us anything we ask . That ’ s because we obey his commands . We do what pleases him .
NIRV	1%20John	3	23	God has commanded us to believe in the name of his Son , Jesus Christ . He has also commanded us to love one another .
NIRV	1%20John	3	24	The one who obeys God ’ s commands remains joined to him . And he remains joined to them . Here is how we know that God lives in us . We know it because of the Holy Spirit he gave us . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20John	4	1	John
NIRV	1%20John	4	4	Dear children , you belong to God . You have not accepted the teachings of the false prophets . That ’ s because the one who is in you is powerful . He is more powerful than the one who is in the world .
NIRV	1%20John	4	2	Here is how you can recognize the Spirit of God . Every spirit agreeing that Jesus Christ came in a human body belongs to God .
NIRV	1%20John	4	3	But every spirit that doesn ’ t agree with this does not belong to God . You have heard that the spirit of the great enemy of Christ is coming . Even now it is already in the world .
NIRV	1%20John	4	5	False prophets belong to the world . So they speak from the world ’ s point of view . And the world listens to them .
NIRV	1%20John	4	6	We belong to God . And those who know God listen to us . But those who don ’ t belong to God don ’ t listen to us . That ’ s how we can tell the difference between the Spirit of truth and the spirit of lies . We Love Because God Loved Us
NIRV	1%20John	4	7	Dear friends , let us love one another , because love comes from God . Everyone who loves has become a child of God and knows God .
NIRV	1%20John	4	8	Anyone who does not love does not know God , because God is love .
NIRV	1%20John	4	9	Here is how God showed his love among us . He sent his one and only Son into the world . He sent him so we could receive life through him .
NIRV	1%20John	4	10	Here is what love is . It is not that we loved God . It is that he loved us and sent his Son to give his life to pay for our sins .
NIRV	1%20John	4	11	Dear friends , since God loved us this much , we should also love one another .
NIRV	1%20John	4	12	No one has ever seen God . But if we love one another , God lives in us . His love is made complete in us .
NIRV	1%20John	4	13	Here ’ s how we know that we are joined to him and he to us . He has given us his Holy Spirit .
NIRV	1%20John	4	14	The Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world . We have seen it and are witnesses to it .
NIRV	1%20John	4	15	God lives in anyone who agrees that Jesus is the Son of God . This kind of person remains joined to God .
NIRV	1%20John	4	16	So we know that God loves us . We depend on it . God is love . Anyone who leads a life of love is joined to God . And God is joined to them .
NIRV	1%20John	4	17	Suppose love is fulfilled among us . Then we can be without fear on the day God judges the world . Love is fulfilled among us when in this world we are like Jesus .
NIRV	1%20John	4	18	There is no fear in love . Instead , perfect love drives away fear . That ’ s because fear has to do with being punished . The one who fears does not have perfect love .
NIRV	1%20John	4	19	We love because he loved us first .
NIRV	1%20John	4	20	Suppose someone claims to love God but hates a brother or sister . Then they are a liar . They don ’ t love their brother or sister , whom they have seen . So they can ’ t love God , whom they haven ’ t seen .
NIRV	1%20John	4	21	Here is the command God has given us . Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20John	5	5	Who is it that has won the battle over the world ? Only the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God .
NIRV	1%20John	5	2	Here is how we know that we love God ’ s children . We know it when we love God and obey his commands .
NIRV	1%20John	5	3	In fact , here is what it means to love God . We love him by obeying his commands . And his commands are not hard to obey .
NIRV	1%20John	5	4	That ’ s because everyone who is a child of God has won the battle over the world . Our faith has won the battle for us .
NIRV	1%20John	5	6	Jesus Christ was born as we are , and he died on the cross . He wasn ’ t just born as we are . He also died on the cross . The Holy Spirit is a truthful witness about him . That ’ s because the Spirit is the truth .
NIRV	1%20John	5	7	There are three that are witnesses about Jesus .
NIRV	1%20John	5	8	They are the Holy Spirit , the birth of Jesus , and the death of Jesus . And the three of them agree .
NIRV	1%20John	5	9	We accept what people say when they are witnesses . But it ’ s more important when God is a witness . That ’ s because it is what God says about his Son .
NIRV	1%20John	5	10	Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts what God says about him . Whoever does not believe God is calling him a liar . That ’ s because they have not believed what God said about his Son .
NIRV	1%20John	5	11	Here is what God says about the Son . God has given us eternal life . And this life is found in his Son .
NIRV	1%20John	5	12	Whoever belongs to the Son has life . Whoever doesn ’ t belong to the Son of God doesn ’ t have life . Final Words
NIRV	1%20John	5	13	I ’ m writing these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God . I ’ m writing so you will know that you have eternal life .
NIRV	1%20John	5	14	Here is what we can be sure of when we come to God in prayer . If we ask anything in keeping with what he wants , he hears us .
NIRV	1%20John	5	15	If we know that God hears what we ask for , we know that we have it .
NIRV	1%20John	5	16	Suppose you see any brother or sister commit a sin . But this sin is not the kind that leads to death . Then you should pray , and God will give them life . I ’ m talking about someone whose sin does not lead to death . But there is a sin that does lead to death . I ’ m not saying you should pray about that sin .
NIRV	1%20John	5	17	Every wrong thing we do is sin . But there are sins that do not lead to death .
NIRV	1%20John	5	18	We know that those who are children of God do not keep on sinning . The Son of God keeps them safe . The evil one can ’ t harm them .
NIRV	1%20John	5	19	We know that we are children of God . We know that the whole world is under the control of the evil one .
NIRV	1%20John	5	20	We also know that the Son of God has come . He has given us understanding . So we can know the God who is true . And we belong to the true God by belonging to his Son , Jesus Christ . He is the true God and eternal life .

NIRV	2%20John	1	2	I love you because of the truth that is alive in us . This truth will be with us forever .
NIRV	2%20John	1	1	I , the elder , am writing this letter . I am sending it to the lady chosen by God and to her children . I love all of you because of the truth . I ’ m not the only one who loves you . So does everyone who knows the truth .
NIRV	2%20John	1	3	God the Father and Jesus Christ his Son will give you grace , mercy and peace . These blessings will be with us because we love the truth .
NIRV	2%20John	1	4	It has given me great joy to find some of your children living by the truth . That ’ s just what the Father commanded us to do .
NIRV	2%20John	1	5	Dear lady , I ’ m not writing you a new command . I ’ m writing a command we ’ ve had from the beginning . I ’ m asking that we love one another .
NIRV	2%20John	1	6	The way we show our love is to obey God ’ s commands . He commands you to lead a life of love . That ’ s what you have heard from the beginning .
NIRV	2%20John	1	7	I say this because many people have tried to fool others . These people have gone out into the world . They don ’ t agree that Jesus Christ came in a human body . People like this try to trick others . These people are like the great enemy of Christ .
NIRV	2%20John	1	8	Watch out that you don ’ t lose what we have worked for . Make sure that you get your full reward .
NIRV	2%20John	1	9	Suppose someone thinks they know more than we do . So they don ’ t follow Christ ’ s teaching . Then that person doesn ’ t belong to God . But whoever follows Christ ’ s teaching belongs to the Father and the Son .
NIRV	2%20John	1	10	Suppose someone comes to you and doesn ’ t teach these truths . Then don ’ t take them into your house or welcome them .
NIRV	2%20John	1	11	Anyone who welcomes them shares in their evil work .
NIRV	2%20John	1	12	I have a lot to write to you . But I don ’ t want to use paper and ink . I hope I can visit you instead . Then I can talk with you face to face . That will make our joy complete .

NIRV	3%20John	1	3	Some believers came to me and told me that you are faithful to the truth . They told me that you continue to live by it . This news gave me great joy .
NIRV	3%20John	1	1	I , the elder , am writing this letter . I am sending it to you , my dear friend Gaius . I love you because of the truth .
NIRV	3%20John	1	2	Dear friend , I know that your spiritual life is going well . I pray that you also may enjoy good health . And I pray that everything else may go well with you .
NIRV	3%20John	1	4	I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are living by the truth .
NIRV	3%20John	1	5	Dear friend , you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers and sisters . You are faithful even though they are strangers to you .
NIRV	3%20John	1	6	They have told the church about your love . Please help them by sending them on their way in a manner that honors God .
NIRV	3%20John	1	7	They started on their journey to serve Jesus Christ . They didn ’ t receive any help from those who aren ’ t believers .
NIRV	3%20John	1	8	So we should welcome people like them . We should work together with them for the truth .
NIRV	3%20John	1	9	I wrote to the church . But Diotrephes will not welcome us . He loves to be the first in everything .
NIRV	3%20John	1	10	So when I come , I will point out what he is doing . He is saying evil things that aren ’ t true about us . Even this doesn ’ t satisfy him . So he refuses to welcome other believers . He also keeps others from welcoming them . In fact , he throws them out of the church .
NIRV	3%20John	1	11	Dear friend , don ’ t be like those who do evil . Be like those who do good . Anyone who does what is good belongs to God . Anyone who does what is evil hasn ’ t really seen or known God .
NIRV	3%20John	1	12	Everyone says good things about Demetrius . He lives in keeping with the truth . We also say good things about him . And you know that what we say is true .
NIRV	3%20John	1	13	I have a lot to write to you . But I don ’ t want to write with pen and ink .
NIRV	3%20John	1	14	I hope I can see you soon . Then we can talk face to face . May you have peace . The friends here send their greetings . Greet each one of the friends there . Copyright ©

NIRV	Jude	1	1	I , Jude , am writing this letter . I serve Jesus Christ . I am a brother of James . I am sending this letter to you who have been chosen by God . You are loved by God the Father . You are kept safe for Jesus Christ .
NIRV	Jude	1	2	May more and more mercy , peace and love be given to you . A Warning Against the Sin of Ungodly People
NIRV	Jude	1	3	Dear friends , I really wanted to write to you about the salvation we share . But now I feel I should write and ask you to stand up for the faith . God ’ s holy people were trusted with it once and for all time .
NIRV	Jude	1	4	Certain people have secretly slipped in among you . Long ago it was written that they would be judged . They are ungodly people . They misuse the grace of our God as an excuse for sexual sins . They say no to Jesus Christ , our only Lord and King .
NIRV	Jude	1	5	I want to remind you about some things you already know . The Lord saved his people . At one time he brought them out of Egypt . But later he destroyed those who did not believe .
NIRV	Jude	1	6	Some of the angels didn ’ t stay where they belonged . They didn ’ t keep their positions of authority . The Lord has kept those angels in darkness . They are held by chains that last forever . On judgment day , God will judge them .
NIRV	Jude	1	7	The people of Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns around them also did evil things . They freely committed sexual sins . They committed sins of the worst possible kind . There is a fire that never goes out . Those people are an example of those who are punished with it .
NIRV	Jude	1	8	In the very same way , these ungodly people act on their evil dreams . So they make their own bodies impure . They don ’ t accept authority . And they say evil things against heavenly beings .
NIRV	Jude	1	9	But even Michael , the leader of the angels , didn ’ t dare to say these things . He didn ’ t even say these things when he argued with the devil about the body of Moses . Michael didn ’ t dare to judge the devil . He didn ’ t say the devil was guilty of saying evil things . Instead , Michael said , “ May the Lord judge you ! ”
NIRV	Jude	1	10	But these people say evil things against whatever they don ’ t understand . And the very things they do understand will destroy them . That ’ s because they are like wild animals that can ’ t think for themselves . Instead , they do what comes naturally to them .
NIRV	Jude	1	11	How terrible it will be for them ! They have followed the way of Cain . They have rushed into the same mistake Balaam made . They did it because they loved money . They are like Korah . He turned against his leaders . These people will certainly be destroyed , just as Korah was .
NIRV	Jude	1	12	These ungodly people are like stains at the meals you share . They have no shame . They are shepherds who feed only themselves . They are like clouds without rain . They are blown along by the wind . They are like trees in the fall . Since they have no fruit , they are pulled out of the ground . So they die twice .
NIRV	Jude	1	13	They are like wild waves of the sea . Their shame rises up like foam . They are like falling stars . God has reserved a place of very black darkness for them forever .
NIRV	Jude	1	14	Enoch was the seventh man in the family line of Adam . He gave a prophecy about these people . He said , “ Look ! The Lord is coming with thousands and thousands of his holy ones .
NIRV	Jude	1	15	He is coming to judge everyone . He is coming to sentence all of them . He will judge them for all the ungodly acts they have done . They have done them in ungodly ways . He will sentence ungodly sinners for all the things they have said to oppose him. ”
NIRV	Jude	1	16	These people complain and find fault with others . They follow their own evil desires . They brag about themselves . They praise others to get what they want . Remain in God ’ s Love
NIRV	Jude	1	17	Dear friends , remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ said would happen .
NIRV	Jude	1	18	They told you , “ In the last days , some people will make fun of the truth . They will follow their own ungodly desires. ”
NIRV	Jude	1	19	They are the people who separate you from one another . They do only what comes naturally . They are not led by the Holy Spirit .
NIRV	Jude	1	20	But you , dear friends , build yourselves up in your most holy faith . Let the Holy Spirit guide and help you when you pray .
NIRV	Jude	1	21	And by doing these things , remain in God ’ s love as you wait . You are waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you eternal life .
NIRV	Jude	1	22	Show mercy to those who doubt .
NIRV	Jude	1	23	Save others by pulling them out of the fire . To others , show mercy mixed with fear of sin . Hate even the clothes that are stained by the sins of those who wear them . Praise to God
NIRV	Jude	1	24	Give praise to the God who is able to keep you from falling into sin . He will bring you into his heavenly glory without any fault . He will bring you there with great joy .
NIRV	Jude	1	25	Give praise to the only God our Savior . Glory , majesty , power and authority belong to him . Give praise to him through Jesus Christ our Lord . His praise was before all time , continues now , and will last forever . Amen . Copyright ©

NIRV	Revelation	1	2	John is a witness to everything he saw . What he saw is God ’ s word and what Jesus Christ has said .
NIRV	Revelation	1	3	Blessed is the one who reads out loud the words of this prophecy . Blessed are those who hear it and think everything it says is important . The time when these things will come true is near . Greetings and Praise to God
NIRV	Revelation	1	4	I , John , am writing this letter . I am sending it to the seven churches in Asia Minor . May grace and peace come to you from God . He is the one who is , and who was , and who will come . May grace and peace come to you from the seven spirits . These spirits are in front of God ’ s throne .
NIRV	Revelation	1	5	May grace and peace come to you from Jesus Christ . He is the faithful witness , so what he has shown can be trusted . He was the first to rise from the dead . He rules over the kings of the earth . Glory and power belong to Jesus Christ who loves us ! He has set us free from our sins by pouring out his blood for us .
NIRV	Revelation	1	6	He has made us members of his royal family . He has made us priests who serve his God and Father . Glory and power belong to Jesus Christ for ever and ever ! Amen .
NIRV	Revelation	1	7	“ Look ! He is coming with the clouds ! ” ( Daniel 7:13 ) “ Every eye will see him . Even those who pierced him will see him. ” All the nations of the earth “ will mourn because of him. ” ( Zechariah 12:10 ) This will really happen ! Amen .
NIRV	Revelation	1	8	“ I am the Alpha and the Omega , the Beginning and the End , ” says the Lord God . “ I am the God who is , and who was , and who will come . I am the Mighty One. ” John ’ s Vision of Christ
NIRV	Revelation	1	9	I , John , am a believer like you . I am a friend who suffers like you . As members of Jesus ’ royal family , we can put up with anything that happens to us . I was on the island of Patmos because I taught God ’ s word and what Jesus said .
NIRV	Revelation	1	10	The Holy Spirit gave me a vision on the Lord ’ s Day . I heard a loud voice behind me that sounded like a trumpet .
NIRV	Revelation	1	11	The voice said , “ Write on a scroll what you see . Send it to the seven churches in Asia Minor . They are Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia and Laodicea. ”
NIRV	Revelation	1	12	I turned around to see who was speaking to me . When I turned , I saw seven golden lampstands .
NIRV	Revelation	1	13	In the middle of them was someone who looked “ like a son of man. ” ( Daniel 7:13 ) He was dressed in a long robe with a gold strip of cloth around his chest .
NIRV	Revelation	1	14	The hair on his head was white like wool , as white as snow . His eyes were like a blazing fire .
NIRV	Revelation	1	15	His feet were like bronze metal glowing in a furnace . His voice sounded like rushing waters .
NIRV	Revelation	1	16	He held seven stars in his right hand . Coming out of his mouth was a sharp sword with two edges . His face was like the sun shining in all its brightness .
NIRV	Revelation	1	17	When I saw him , I fell at his feet as if I were dead . Then he put his right hand on me and said , “ Do not be afraid . I am the First and the Last .
NIRV	Revelation	1	18	I am the Living One . I was dead . But now look ! I am alive for ever and ever ! And I hold the keys to Death and Hell .
NIRV	Revelation	1	19	“ So write down what you have seen . Write about what is happening now and what will happen later .
NIRV	Revelation	1	20	Here is the meaning of the mystery of the seven stars you saw in my right hand . They are the angels of the seven churches . And the seven golden lampstands you saw stand for the seven churches . Copyright ©

NIRV	Revelation	2	14	‘ But I have a few things against you . Some of your people follow the teaching of Balaam . He taught Balak to lead the people of Israel into sin . So they ate food that had been offered to statues of gods . And they committed sexual sins .

NIRV	Revelation	2	19	‘ I know what you are doing . I know your love and your faith . I know how well you have served . I know you don ’ t give up easily . In fact , you are doing more now than you did at first .
NIRV	Revelation	2	20	‘ But here is what I have against you . You put up with that woman Jezebel . She calls herself a prophet . With her teaching , she has led my servants into sexual sin . She has tricked them into eating food offered to statues of gods .
NIRV	Revelation	2	21	I ’ ve given her time to turn away from her sinful ways . But she doesn ’ t want to .
NIRV	Revelation	2	22	She lay down to commit her sin so I will make her lie down in suffering . Those who commit adultery with her will suffer greatly too . Their only way out is to turn away from what she taught them to do .
NIRV	Revelation	2	23	I will strike her children dead . Then all the churches will know that I search hearts and minds . I will pay each of you back for what you have done .
NIRV	Revelation	2	24	‘ I won ’ t ask the rest of you in Thyatira to do anything else . You don ’ t follow the teaching of Jezebel . You haven ’ t learned what some people call Satan ’ s deep secrets .
NIRV	Revelation	2	25	Just hold on to what you have until I come .
NIRV	Revelation	2	26	‘ Here is what I will do for anyone who has victory over sin . I will do it for anyone who carries out my plans to the end . I will give that person authority over the nations .
NIRV	Revelation	2	27	It is written , “ They will rule them with an iron scepter . They will break them to pieces like clay pots. ” ( Psalm 2:9 ) Their authority is like the authority I ’ ve received from my Father .
NIRV	Revelation	2	28	I will also give the morning star to all who have victory .

NIRV	Revelation	3	15	‘ I know what you are doing . I know you aren ’ t cold or hot . I wish you were either one or the other !
NIRV	Revelation	3	16	But you are lukewarm . You aren ’ t hot or cold . So I am going to spit you out of my mouth .
NIRV	Revelation	3	17	You say , “ I am rich . I ’ ve become wealthy and don ’ t need anything. ” But you don ’ t realize how pitiful and miserable you have become . You are poor , blind and naked .
NIRV	Revelation	3	18	So here ’ s my advice . Buy from me gold made pure by fire . Then you will become rich . Buy from me white clothes to wear . Then you will be able to cover the shame of your naked bodies . And buy from me healing lotion to put on your eyes . Then you will be able to see .
NIRV	Revelation	3	19	‘ I warn and correct those I love . So be sincere , and turn away from your sins .
NIRV	Revelation	3	20	Here I am ! I stand at the door and knock . If anyone hears my voice and opens the door , I will come in . I will eat with that person , and they will eat with me .

NIRV	Revelation	4	4	Twenty-four other thrones surrounded that throne . Twenty-four elders were sitting on them . The elders were dressed in white . They had gold crowns on their heads .
NIRV	Revelation	4	2	At once the Holy Spirit gave me a vision . There in front of me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it .
NIRV	Revelation	4	3	The one who sat there shone like jasper and ruby . Around the throne was a rainbow shining like an emerald .
NIRV	Revelation	4	5	From the throne came flashes of lightning , rumblings and thunder . Seven lamps were blazing in front of the throne . These stand for the seven spirits of God .
NIRV	Revelation	4	6	There was something that looked like a sea of glass in front of the throne . It was as clear as crystal . In the inner circle , around the throne , were four living creatures . They were covered with eyes , in front and in back .
NIRV	Revelation	4	7	The first creature looked like a lion . The second looked like an ox . The third had a man ’ s face . The fourth looked like a flying eagle .
NIRV	Revelation	4	8	Each of the four living creatures had six wings . Each creature was covered all over with eyes . It had eyes even under its wings . Day and night , they never stop saying , “ ‘ Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God who rules over all. ’ ( Isaiah 6:3 ) He was , and he is , and he will come. ”
NIRV	Revelation	4	9	The living creatures give glory , honor and thanks to the one who sits on the throne . He lives for ever and ever .
NIRV	Revelation	4	10	At the same time , the
NIRV	Revelation	4	24	elders fall down and worship the one who sits on the throne . He lives for ever and ever . They lay their crowns in front of the throne . They say ,
NIRV	Revelation	4	11	“ You are worthy , our Lord and God ! You are worthy to receive glory and honor and power . You are worthy because you created all things . They were created and they exist . This is the way you planned it. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Revelation	5	5	Then one of the elders said to me , “ Do not cry ! The Lion of the tribe of Judah has won the battle . He is the Root of David . He is able to break the seven seals and open the scroll. ”
NIRV	Revelation	5	2	I saw a mighty angel calling out in a loud voice . He said , “ Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll ? ”
NIRV	Revelation	5	3	But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll . No one could even look inside it .
NIRV	Revelation	5	4	I cried and cried . That ’ s because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside .
NIRV	Revelation	5	6	Then I saw a Lamb that looked as if he had been put to death . He stood at the center of the area around the throne . The Lamb was surrounded by the four living creatures and the elders . He had seven horns and seven eyes . The eyes stand for the seven spirits of God , which are sent out into all the earth .
NIRV	Revelation	5	7	The Lamb went and took the scroll . He took it from the right hand of the one sitting on the throne .
NIRV	Revelation	5	8	Then the four living creatures and the
NIRV	Revelation	5	24	elders fell down in front of the Lamb . Each one had a harp . They were holding golden bowls full of incense . They stand for the prayers of God ’ s people .
NIRV	Revelation	5	9	Here is the new song they sang . “ You are worthy to take the scroll and break open its seals . You are worthy because you were put to death . With your blood you bought people for God . They come from every tribe , people and nation , no matter what language they speak .
NIRV	Revelation	5	10	You have made them members of a royal family . You have made them priests to serve our God . They will rule on the earth. ”
NIRV	Revelation	5	11	Then I looked and heard the voice of millions and millions of angels . They surrounded the throne . They surrounded the living creatures and the elders .
NIRV	Revelation	5	12	In a loud voice they were saying , “ The Lamb , who was put to death , is worthy ! He is worthy to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength ! He is worthy to receive honor and glory and praise ! ”
NIRV	Revelation	5	13	All creatures in heaven , on earth , under the earth , and on the sea were speaking . The whole creation was speaking . I heard all of them say , “ Praise and honor belong to the one who sits on the throne and to the Lamb ! Glory and power belong to God for ever and ever ! ”
NIRV	Revelation	5	14	The four living creatures said , “ Amen. ” And the elders fell down and worshiped . Copyright ©

NIRV	Revelation	6	6	Next , I heard what sounded like a voice coming from among the four living creatures . It said , “ Two pounds of wheat for a day ’ s pay . And six pounds of barley for a day ’ s pay . And leave the olive oil and the wine alone ! ”
NIRV	Revelation	6	2	I looked , and there in front of me was a white horse ! Its rider held a bow in his hands . He was given a crown . He rode out like a hero on his way to victory .
NIRV	Revelation	6	3	The Lamb broke open the second seal . Then I heard the second living creature say , “ Come ! ”
NIRV	Revelation	6	4	Another horse came out . It was red like fire . Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth . He was given power to make people kill each other . He was given a large sword .
NIRV	Revelation	6	5	The Lamb broke open the third seal . Then I heard the third living creature say , “ Come ! ” I looked , and there in front of me was a black horse ! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand .
NIRV	Revelation	6	7	The Lamb broke open the fourth seal . Then I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say , “ Come ! ”
NIRV	Revelation	6	8	I looked , and there in front of me was a pale horse ! Its rider ’ s name was Death . Following close behind him was Hell . They were given power over a fourth of the earth . They were given power to kill people by swords . They could also use hunger , sickness and the earth ’ s wild animals to kill .
NIRV	Revelation	6	9	The Lamb broke open the fifth seal . I saw souls under the altar . They were the souls of people who had been killed . They had been killed because of God ’ s word and their faithful witness .
NIRV	Revelation	6	10	They called out in a loud voice . “ How long , Lord and King , holy and true ? ” they asked . “ How long will you wait to judge those who live on the earth ? How long will it be until you pay them back for killing us ? ”
NIRV	Revelation	6	11	Then each of them was given a white robe . “ Wait a little longer , ” they were told . “ There are still more of your believing brothers and sisters who will be killed . They will be killed just as you were. ”
NIRV	Revelation	6	12	I watched as the Lamb broke open the sixth seal . There was a powerful earthquake . The sun turned black like the clothes people wear when they ’ re sad . Those clothes are made out of goat ’ s hair . The whole moon turned as red as blood .
NIRV	Revelation	6	13	The stars in the sky fell to earth . They dropped like figs from a tree shaken by a strong wind .
NIRV	Revelation	6	14	The sky rolled back like a scroll . Every mountain and island was moved out of its place .
NIRV	Revelation	6	15	Everyone hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains . This included the kings of the earth , the princes and the generals . It included rich people and powerful people . It also included everyone else , both slaves and people who were free .
NIRV	Revelation	6	16	They called out to the mountains and rocks , “ Fall on us ! Hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne ! Hide us from the anger of the Lamb !

NIRV	Revelation	7	2	Then I saw another angel coming up from the east . He brought the official seal of the living God . He called out in a loud voice to the four angels . They had been allowed to harm the land and the sea .
NIRV	Revelation	7	3	“ Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees , ” he said . “ Wait until we mark with this seal the foreheads of those who serve our God. ”
NIRV	Revelation	7	4	Then I heard how many people were marked with the seal . There were 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel .

NIRV	Revelation	7	9	After this I looked , and there in front of me was a huge crowd of people . They stood in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb . There were so many that no one could count them . They came from every nation , tribe and people . That ’ s true no matter what language they spoke . They were wearing white robes . In their hands they were holding palm branches .
NIRV	Revelation	7	10	They cried out in a loud voice , “ Salvation belongs to our God , who sits on the throne . Salvation also belongs to the Lamb. ”
NIRV	Revelation	7	11	All the angels were standing around the throne . They were standing around the elders and the four living creatures . They fell down on their faces in front of the throne and worshiped God .
NIRV	Revelation	7	12	They said , “ Amen ! May praise and glory and wisdom be given to our God for ever and ever . Give him thanks and honor and power and strength . Amen ! ”
NIRV	Revelation	7	13	Then one of the elders spoke to me . “ Who are these people dressed in white robes ? ” he asked . “ Where did they come from ? ”
NIRV	Revelation	7	14	I answered , “ Sir , you know. ” He said , “ They are the ones who have come out of the time of terrible suffering . They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
NIRV	Revelation	7	15	So “ they are in front of the throne of God . They serve him day and night in his temple . The one who sits on the throne will be with them to keep them safe .
NIRV	Revelation	7	16	‘ Never again will they be hungry . Never again will they be thirsty . The sun will not beat down on them. ’ ( Isaiah 49:10 ) The heat of the desert will not harm them .
NIRV	Revelation	7	17	The Lamb , who is at the center of the area around the throne , will be their shepherd . ‘ He will lead them to springs of living water. ’ ( Isaiah 49:10 ) ‘ And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. ’ ” ( Isaiah 25:8 ) Copyright ©

NIRV	Revelation	8	8	The second angel blew his trumpet . Something that looked like a huge mountain on fire was thrown into the sea . A third of the sea turned into blood .
NIRV	Revelation	8	2	I saw the seven angels who stand in front of God . Seven trumpets were given to them .
NIRV	Revelation	8	3	Another angel came and stood at the altar . He had a shallow gold cup for burning incense . He was given a lot of incense to offer on the golden altar . The altar was in front of the throne . With the incense he offered the prayers of all God ’ s people .
NIRV	Revelation	8	4	The smoke of the incense rose up from the angel ’ s hand . The prayers of God ’ s people rose up together with it . The smoke and the prayers went up in front of God .
NIRV	Revelation	8	5	Then the angel took the gold cup and filled it with fire from the altar . He threw it down on the earth . There were rumblings and thunder , flashes of lightning , and an earthquake . The Trumpets
NIRV	Revelation	8	6	Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets got ready to blow them .
NIRV	Revelation	8	7	The first angel blew his trumpet . Hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown down on the earth . A third of the earth was burned up . A third of the trees were burned up . All the green grass was burned up .
NIRV	Revelation	8	9	A third of the living creatures in the sea died . A third of the ships were destroyed .
NIRV	Revelation	8	10	The third angel blew his trumpet . Then a great star fell from the sky . It looked like a blazing torch . It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water .
NIRV	Revelation	8	11	The name of the star is Wormwood . A third of the water turned bitter . Many people died from it .
NIRV	Revelation	8	12	The fourth angel blew his trumpet . Then a third of the sun was struck . A third of the moon was struck . A third of the stars were struck . So a third of each of them turned dark . Then a third of the day had no light . The same thing happened to a third of the night .
NIRV	Revelation	8	13	As I watched , I heard an eagle that was flying high in the air . It called out in a loud voice , “ How terrible ! How terrible it will be for those living on the earth ! How terrible ! They will suffer as soon as the next three angels blow their trumpets ! ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Revelation	9	9	Their chests were covered with something that looked like armor made out of iron . The sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle .
NIRV	Revelation	9	2	The star opened the Abyss . Then smoke rose up from it like the smoke from a huge furnace . The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss .
NIRV	Revelation	9	3	Out of the smoke came locusts . They came down on the earth . They were given power like the power of scorpions of the earth .
NIRV	Revelation	9	4	They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree . They were supposed to harm only the people without God ’ s official seal on their foreheads .
NIRV	Revelation	9	5	The locusts were not allowed to kill these people . But the locusts could hurt them over and over for five months . The pain the people suffered was like the sting of a scorpion when it strikes .
NIRV	Revelation	9	6	In those days , people will look for a way to die but won ’ t find it . They will want to die , but death will escape them .
NIRV	Revelation	9	7	The locusts looked like horses ready for battle . On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold . Their faces looked like human faces .
NIRV	Revelation	9	8	Their hair was like women ’ s hair . Their teeth were like lions ’ teeth .
NIRV	Revelation	9	10	They had tails that could sting people like scorpions do . And in their tails they had power to hurt people over and over for five months .
NIRV	Revelation	9	11	Their king was the angel of the Abyss . In the Hebrew language his name is Abaddon . In Greek it is Apollyon . His name means Destroyer .
NIRV	Revelation	9	12	The first terrible judgment is past . Two others are still coming .
NIRV	Revelation	9	13	The sixth angel blew his trumpet . Then I heard a voice coming from the four corners of the golden altar . The altar stands in front of God .
NIRV	Revelation	9	14	The voice spoke to the sixth angel who had the trumpet . The voice said , “ Set the four angels free who are held at the great river Euphrates. ”
NIRV	Revelation	9	15	The four angels had been ready for this very hour and day and month and year . They were set free to kill a third of all people .
NIRV	Revelation	9	16	The number of troops on horseback was 200,000,000 . I heard how many there were .
NIRV	Revelation	9	17	The horses and riders I saw in my vision had armor on their chests . It was red like fire , dark blue , and yellow like sulfur . The heads of the horses looked like lions ’ heads . Out of their mouths came fire , smoke and sulfur .
NIRV	Revelation	9	18	A third of all people were killed by the three plagues of fire , smoke and sulfur that came out of the horses ’ mouths .
NIRV	Revelation	9	19	The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails . The tails were like snakes whose heads could bite .
NIRV	Revelation	9	20	There were people who were not killed by these plagues . But they still didn ’ t turn away from what they had been doing . They did not stop worshiping demons . They kept worshiping statues of gods made out of gold , silver , bronze , stone and wood . These statues can ’ t see or hear or walk .
NIRV	Revelation	9	21	The people also did not turn away from their murders , witchcraft , sexual sins and stealing . Copyright ©

NIRV	Revelation	10	10	I took the little scroll from the angel ’ s hand and ate it . In my mouth it tasted as sweet as honey . But when I had eaten it , it became sour in my stomach .
NIRV	Revelation	10	2	He was holding a little scroll . It was lying open in his hand . The angel put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land .
NIRV	Revelation	10	3	Then he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion . When he shouted , the voices of the seven thunders spoke .
NIRV	Revelation	10	4	When they had spoken , I was getting ready to write . But I heard a voice from heaven say , “ Seal up what the seven thunders have said . Do not write it down. ”
NIRV	Revelation	10	5	I had seen an angel standing on the sea and on the land . This angel raised his right hand to heaven .
NIRV	Revelation	10	6	He made a promise in the name of the God who lives for ever and ever . This is the God who created the sky , earth and sea and all that is in them . The angel said , “ There will be no more waiting !
NIRV	Revelation	10	7	God ’ s plan will be carried out . This will happen when the seventh angel is ready to blow his trumpet . God told all this to the prophets who served him long ago. ”
NIRV	Revelation	10	8	Then the voice I had heard from heaven spoke to me again . It said , “ The angel is standing on the sea and on the land . Go and take the scroll from him . It is lying open in his hand. ”
NIRV	Revelation	10	9	So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll . He said to me , “ Take it and eat it . It will become sour in your stomach . But ‘ in your mouth it will taste as sweet as honey. ’ ” ( Ezekiel 3:3 )
NIRV	Revelation	10	11	Then I was told , “ You must prophesy again about many peoples , nations , languages and kings. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Revelation	11	11	But after the three and a half days , the breath of life from God entered the witnesses . They both stood up . Terror struck those who saw them .
NIRV	Revelation	11	2	But do not measure the outer courtyard . That ’ s because it has been given to the Gentiles . They will take over the holy city for
NIRV	Revelation	11	42	months .
NIRV	Revelation	11	3	I will appoint my two witnesses . And they will prophesy for 1,260 days . They will be dressed in the rough clothes people wear when they ’ re sad. ”
NIRV	Revelation	11	4	The witnesses are “ the two olive trees ” and the two lampstands . And “ they stand in front of the Lord of the earth. ” ( Zechariah 4:3,11,14 )
NIRV	Revelation	11	5	If anyone tries to harm them , fire comes from their mouths and eats up their enemies . This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die .
NIRV	Revelation	11	6	These witnesses have power to close up the sky . Then it will not rain while they are prophesying . They also have power to turn the waters into blood . And they can strike the earth with every kind of plague . They can do this as often as they want to .
NIRV	Revelation	11	7	When they have finished speaking , the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them . He will overpower them and kill them .
NIRV	Revelation	11	8	Their bodies will lie in the main street of the great city . It is also the city where their Lord was nailed to a cross . The city is sometimes compared to Sodom or Egypt .
NIRV	Revelation	11	9	For three and a half days , people will stare at their bodies . These people will be from every tribe and nation , no matter what language they speak . They will refuse to bury them .
NIRV	Revelation	11	10	Those who live on the earth will be happy about this . That ’ s because those two prophets had made them suffer . The people will celebrate by sending one another gifts .
NIRV	Revelation	11	12	Then the two witnesses heard a loud voice from heaven . It said to them , “ Come up here. ” They went up to heaven in a cloud . Their enemies watched it happen .
NIRV	Revelation	11	13	At that same time there was a powerful earthquake . A tenth of the city crumbled and fell . In the earthquake , 7,000 people were killed . Those who lived through it were terrified . They gave glory to the God of heaven .
NIRV	Revelation	11	14	The second terrible judgment has passed . The third is coming soon . The Seventh Trumpet
NIRV	Revelation	11	15	The seventh angel blew his trumpet . There were loud voices in heaven . They said , “ The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah . He will rule for ever and ever. ”
NIRV	Revelation	11	16	The
NIRV	Revelation	11	24	elders were sitting on their thrones in front of God . They fell on their faces and worshiped God .
NIRV	Revelation	11	17	They said , “ Lord God who rules over all , we give thanks to you . You are the God who is and who was . We give you thanks . That ’ s because you have begun to rule with your great power .
NIRV	Revelation	11	18	The nations were angry , and the time for your anger has come . The time has come to judge the dead . It is time to reward your servants the prophets and your people who honor you . There is a reward for all your people , both great and small . It is time to destroy those who destroy the earth. ”

NIRV	Revelation	12	12	So be joyful , you heavens ! Be glad , all you who live there ! But how terrible it will be for the earth and the sea ! The devil has come down to you . He is very angry . He knows his time is short. ”
NIRV	Revelation	12	2	She was pregnant . She cried out in pain because she was about to have a baby .
NIRV	Revelation	12	3	Then another sign appeared in heaven . It was a huge red dragon . It had seven heads and ten horns . On its seven heads it wore seven crowns .
NIRV	Revelation	12	4	The dragon ’ s tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky . It threw the stars down to earth . The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to have a baby . The dragon wanted to eat her child the moment he was born .
NIRV	Revelation	12	5	She gave birth to a son . He “ will rule all the nations with an iron scepter. ” ( Psalm 2:9 ) And her child was taken up to God and to his throne .
NIRV	Revelation	12	6	The woman escaped into the desert where God had a place prepared for her . There she would be taken care of for 1,260 days .
NIRV	Revelation	12	7	Then a war began in heaven . Michael and his angels fought against the dragon . And the dragon and his angels fought back .
NIRV	Revelation	12	8	But the dragon wasn ’ t strong enough . Both he and his angels lost their place in heaven .
NIRV	Revelation	12	9	The great dragon was thrown down to the earth , and his angels with him . The dragon is that old serpent called the devil , or Satan . He leads the whole world astray .
NIRV	Revelation	12	10	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven . It said , “ Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God have come . The authority of his Messiah has come . Satan , who brings charges against our brothers and sisters , has been thrown down . He brings charges against them in front of our God day and night .
NIRV	Revelation	12	11	They had victory over him by the blood the Lamb spilled for them . They had victory over him by speaking the truth about Jesus to others . They were willing to risk their lives , even if it led to death .
NIRV	Revelation	12	13	The dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth . So he chased the woman who had given birth to the boy .
NIRV	Revelation	12	14	The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle . She was given these wings so that she could fly away . She could fly to the place prepared for her in the desert . There she would be taken care of for three and a half years . She would be out of the serpent ’ s reach .
NIRV	Revelation	12	15	Then out of his mouth the serpent spit water like a river . He wanted to catch the woman and sweep her away in the flood .
NIRV	Revelation	12	16	But the earth helped the woman . It opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had spit out .
NIRV	Revelation	12	17	The dragon was very angry with the woman . He went off to make war against the rest of her children . They obey God ’ s commands . And they hold firmly to the truth they have said about Jesus . Copyright ©

NIRV	Revelation	13	13	The second beast performed great signs . It even made fire come from heaven to the earth . And the fire was seen by everyone .
NIRV	Revelation	13	2	The beast I saw looked like a leopard . But it had feet like a bear and a mouth like a lion . The dragon gave the beast his power , his throne , and great authority .
NIRV	Revelation	13	3	One of the beast ’ s heads seemed to have had a deadly wound . But the wound had been healed . The whole world was amazed and followed the beast .
NIRV	Revelation	13	4	People worshiped the dragon , because he had given authority to the beast . They also worshiped the beast . They asked , “ Who is like the beast ? Who can make war against it ? ”
NIRV	Revelation	13	5	The beast was given a mouth to brag and speak evil things against God . The beast was allowed to use its authority for
NIRV	Revelation	13	42	months .
NIRV	Revelation	13	6	The beast opened its mouth to speak evil things against God . It told lies about God and about the place where God lives . And it told lies about those who live in heaven with him .
NIRV	Revelation	13	7	The beast was allowed to make war against God ’ s holy people and to overcome them . It was given authority over every tribe , people and nation , no matter what language they spoke .
NIRV	Revelation	13	8	Many people who live on the earth will worship the beast . They are the ones whose names are not written in the Lamb ’ s book of life . The Lamb is the one whose death was planned before the world was created .
NIRV	Revelation	13	9	Whoever has ears should listen .
NIRV	Revelation	13	10	“ Everyone who is supposed to be captured will be captured . Everyone who is supposed to be killed by a sword will be killed by a sword. ” ( Jeremiah 15:2 ) So God ’ s people must be patient and faithful . The Beast Who Comes Out of the Earth
NIRV	Revelation	13	11	Then I saw a second beast . This one came out of the earth . It had two horns like a lamb . But it spoke like a dragon .
NIRV	Revelation	13	12	This beast had all the authority of the first beast . It did what the first beast wanted . It made the earth and all who live on it worship the first beast . The first beast was the one whose deadly wound had been healed .
NIRV	Revelation	13	14	The first beast had given the second beast the power to perform these signs . By these signs , the second beast tricked those who live on the earth . The second beast ordered people to set up a statue to honor the first beast . The first beast was the one who had been wounded by a sword and still lived .
NIRV	Revelation	13	15	The second beast was allowed to give breath to this statue so it could speak . The statue could kill all who refused to worship it .
NIRV	Revelation	13	16	It also forced everyone to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead . People great or small , rich or poor , free or slave had to receive the mark .
NIRV	Revelation	13	17	They could not buy or sell anything unless they had the mark . The mark is the name of the beast or the number of its name .
NIRV	Revelation	13	18	This problem requires wisdom . Anyone who is wise should figure out what the beast ’ s number means . It is the number of a man . And that number is

NIRV	Revelation	14	14	I looked , and there in front of me was a white cloud . Sitting on the cloud was one who looked “ like a son of man. ” ( Daniel 7:13 ) He wore a gold crown on his head . In his hand was a sharp , curved blade for cutting grain .
NIRV	Revelation	14	2	I heard a sound from heaven . It was like the roar of rushing waters and loud thunder . The sound I heard was like the music of harps being played .
NIRV	Revelation	14	3	Then everyone sang a new song in front of the throne . They sang it in front of the four living creatures and the elders . No one could learn the song except the 144,000 . They had been set free from the evil of the earth .
NIRV	Revelation	14	4	They had not committed sexual sins with women . They had kept themselves pure . They follow the Lamb wherever he goes . They were purchased from among human beings as a first offering to God and the Lamb .
NIRV	Revelation	14	5	They told no lies . They are without blame . The Three Angels
NIRV	Revelation	14	6	I saw another angel . He was flying high in the air . He came to tell everyone on earth the good news that will always be true . He told it to every nation , tribe and people , no matter what language they spoke .
NIRV	Revelation	14	7	In a loud voice he said , “ Have respect for God . Give him glory . The hour has come for God to judge . Worship him who made the heavens and the earth . Worship him who made the sea and the springs of water. ”
NIRV	Revelation	14	8	A second angel followed him . He said , “ ‘ Fallen ! Babylon the Great has fallen ! ’ ( Isaiah 21:9 ) The city of Babylon made all the nations drink the strong wine of her terrible sins. ”
NIRV	Revelation	14	9	A third angel followed them . He said in a loud voice , “ There will be trouble for anyone who worships the beast and its statue ! There will be trouble for anyone who has its mark on their forehead or their hand !
NIRV	Revelation	14	10	They , too , will drink the wine of God ’ s great anger . His wine has been poured full strength into the cup of his anger . They will be burned with flaming sulfur . The holy angels and the Lamb will see it happen .
NIRV	Revelation	14	11	The smoke of their terrible suffering will rise for ever and ever . Day and night , there will be no rest for anyone who worships the beast and its statue . There will be no rest for anyone who receives the mark of its name. ”
NIRV	Revelation	14	12	God ’ s people need to be very patient . They are the ones who obey God ’ s commands . And they remain faithful to Jesus .
NIRV	Revelation	14	13	Then I heard a voice from heaven . “ Write this , ” it said . “ Blessed are the dead who die as believers in the Lord from now on. ” “ Yes , ” says the Holy Spirit . “ They will rest from their labor . What they have done will not be forgotten. ” The Harvest of the Earth
NIRV	Revelation	14	15	Then another angel came out of the temple . He called in a loud voice to the one sitting on the cloud . “ Take your blade , ” he said . “ Cut the grain . The time has come . The earth is ready to be harvested. ”
NIRV	Revelation	14	16	So the one sitting on the cloud swung his blade over the earth . And the earth was harvested .
NIRV	Revelation	14	17	Another angel came out of the temple in heaven . He too had a sharp , curved blade .
NIRV	Revelation	14	18	Still another angel came from the altar . He was in charge of the fire on the altar . He called out in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp blade . “ Take your blade , ” he said , “ and gather the bunches of grapes from the earth ’ s vine . Its grapes are ripe. ”
NIRV	Revelation	14	19	So the angel swung his blade over the earth . He gathered its grapes . Then he threw them into a huge winepress . The winepress stands for God ’ s anger .
NIRV	Revelation	14	20	In the winepress outside the city , the grapes were stomped on . Blood flowed out of the winepress . It spread over the land for about
NIRV	Revelation	14	180	miles . It rose as high as the horses ’ heads . Copyright ©

NIRV	Revelation	15	15	I saw in heaven another great and wonderful sign . Seven angels were about to bring the seven last plagues . The plagues would complete God ’ s anger .
NIRV	Revelation	15	2	Then I saw something that looked like a sea of glass glowing with fire . Standing beside the sea were those who had won the battle over the beast . They had also overcome its statue and the number of its name . They held harps given to them by God .
NIRV	Revelation	15	3	They sang the song of God ’ s servant Moses and of the Lamb . They sang , “ Lord God who rules over all , everything you do is great and wonderful . King of the nations , your ways are true and fair .
NIRV	Revelation	15	4	Lord , who will not have respect for you ? Who will not bring glory to your name ? You alone are holy . All nations will come and worship you . They see that the things you do are right. ”
NIRV	Revelation	15	5	After this I looked , and I saw the temple in heaven . And it was opened . The temple is the holy tent where the tablets of the covenant law were kept .
NIRV	Revelation	15	6	Out of the temple came the seven angels who were bringing the seven plagues . They were dressed in clean , shining linen . They wore gold strips of cloth around their chests .
NIRV	Revelation	15	7	Then one of the four living creatures gave seven golden bowls to the seven angels . The bowls were filled with the anger of God , who lives for ever and ever .
NIRV	Revelation	15	8	The temple was filled with smoke that came from the glory and power of God . No one could enter the temple at that time . They had to wait until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed . Copyright ©

NIRV	Revelation	16	16	Then the evil spirits gathered the kings together . In the Hebrew language , the place where the kings met is called Armageddon .
NIRV	Revelation	16	2	The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land . Ugly and painful sores broke out on people . Those people had the mark of the beast and worshiped its statue .
NIRV	Revelation	16	3	The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea . It turned into blood like the blood of a dead person . Every living thing in the sea died .
NIRV	Revelation	16	4	The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water . They became blood .
NIRV	Revelation	16	5	Then I heard the angel who was in charge of the waters . He said , “ Holy One , the way you judge is fair . You are the God who is and who was .
NIRV	Revelation	16	6	Those who worship the beast have poured out blood . They have poured out the life ’ s blood of your holy people and your prophets . So you have given blood to drink to those who worship the beast . That ’ s exactly what they should get. ”
NIRV	Revelation	16	7	Then I heard the altar reply . It said , “ Lord God who rules over all , the way you judge is true and fair. ”
NIRV	Revelation	16	8	The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun . The sun was allowed to burn people with fire .
NIRV	Revelation	16	9	They were burned by the blazing heat . So they spoke evil things against the name of God , who controlled these plagues . But they refused to turn away from their sins . They did not give glory to God .
NIRV	Revelation	16	10	The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast . The kingdom of the beast became very dark . People chewed on their tongues because they were suffering so much .
NIRV	Revelation	16	11	They spoke evil things against the God of heaven . They did this because of their pains and their sores . But they refused to turn away from the sins they had committed .
NIRV	Revelation	16	12	The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates . Its water dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East .
NIRV	Revelation	16	13	Then I saw three evil spirits that looked like frogs . They came out of the mouths of the dragon , the beast and the false prophet .
NIRV	Revelation	16	14	They are spirits of demons that perform signs . They go out to gather the kings of the whole world for battle . This battle will take place on the great day of the God who rules over all .
NIRV	Revelation	16	15	“ Look ! I am coming like a thief ! Blessed is anyone who stays awake and keeps their clothes on . Then they will be ready . They will not be caught naked and so be put to shame. ”
NIRV	Revelation	16	17	The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air . Out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne . It said , “ It is done ! ”
NIRV	Revelation	16	18	Then there came flashes of lightning , rumblings , thunder and a powerful earthquake . There has never been an earthquake as terrible as this . One like this hasn ’ t happened while human beings have lived on earth .
NIRV	Revelation	16	19	The great city split into three parts . The cities of the nations crumbled and fell . God remembered Babylon the Great . He gave Babylon the cup filled with the wine of his terrible anger .
NIRV	Revelation	16	20	Every island ran away . The mountains could not be found .
NIRV	Revelation	16	21	Huge hailstones weighing about
NIRV	Revelation	16	100	pounds each fell from the sky . The hail crushed people . And they spoke evil things against God because of the plague . That ’ s because the plague of hail was so terrible . Copyright ©

NIRV	Revelation	17	17	God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose . So they agreed to give the beast their royal authority . They will give him this authority until God ’ s words come true .
NIRV	Revelation	17	2	The kings of the earth took part in her evil ways . The people living on earth were drunk with the wine of her terrible sins. ”
NIRV	Revelation	17	3	Then in a vision the angel carried me away to a desert . There the Holy Spirit showed me a woman sitting on a bright red beast . It was covered with names that say evil things about God . It had seven heads and ten horns .
NIRV	Revelation	17	4	The woman was dressed in purple and bright red . She was gleaming with gold , jewels and pearls . In her hand she held a golden cup filled with things that God hates . It was filled with her terrible , dirty sins .
NIRV	Revelation	17	5	The name written on her forehead was a mystery . Here is what it said . the great city of babylon the mother of prostitutes the mother of everything on earth that god hates
NIRV	Revelation	17	6	I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God ’ s holy people . They are the ones who are witnesses about Jesus . When I saw her , I was very amazed .
NIRV	Revelation	17	7	Then the angel said to me , “ Why are you amazed ? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman . And I will explain the mystery of the beast she rides on . The beast is the one who has the seven heads and ten horns .
NIRV	Revelation	17	8	The beast that you saw used to exist and now does not . Yet it will come up out of the Abyss and be destroyed . Some people on the earth will be amazed when they see the beast . Their names have not been written in the book of life from the time the world was created . They will be amazed at the beast . That ’ s because it will come again even though it used to exist and now does not .
NIRV	Revelation	17	9	“ Here is a problem that you have to be wise to understand . The seven heads are seven hills that the woman sits on .
NIRV	Revelation	17	10	They are also seven kings . Five have fallen , one is ruling , and the other has still not come . When he does come , he must remain for only a little while .
NIRV	Revelation	17	11	The beast who used to exist , and now does not , is an eighth king . He belongs to the other seven . He will be destroyed .
NIRV	Revelation	17	12	“ The ten horns you saw are ten kings . They have not yet received a kingdom . But for one hour they will receive authority to rule together with the beast .
NIRV	Revelation	17	13	They have only one purpose . So they will give their power and authority to the beast .
NIRV	Revelation	17	14	They will make war against the Lamb . But the Lamb will have victory over them . That ’ s because he is the most powerful Lord of all and the greatest King of all . His appointed , chosen and faithful followers will be with him. ”
NIRV	Revelation	17	15	Then the angel spoke to me . “ You saw the waters the prostitute sits on , ” he said . “ They stand for all the nations of the world , no matter what their race or language is .
NIRV	Revelation	17	16	The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute . They will destroy her and leave her naked . They will eat her flesh and burn her with fire .
NIRV	Revelation	17	18	The woman you saw stands for the great city of Babylon . That city rules over the kings of the earth. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Revelation	18	18	They will see the smoke rising as Babylon burns . They will ask , ‘ Was there ever a city like this great city ? ’
NIRV	Revelation	18	2	With a mighty voice he shouted , “ ‘ Fallen ! Babylon the Great has fallen ! ’ ( Isaiah 21:9 ) She has become a place where demons live . She has become a den for every evil spirit . She has become a place where every ‘ unclean ’ bird is found . She has become a place where every ‘ unclean ’ and hated animal is found .
NIRV	Revelation	18	3	All the nations have drunk the strong wine of her terrible sins . The kings of the earth took part in her evil ways . The traders of the world grew rich from her great wealth. ” Warning to Run From Babylon ’ s Judgment
NIRV	Revelation	18	4	Then I heard another voice from heaven . It said , “ ‘ Come out of her , my people. ’ ( Jeremiah 51:45 ) Then you will not take part in her sins . You will not suffer from any of her plagues .
NIRV	Revelation	18	5	Her sins are piled up to heaven . God has remembered her crimes .
NIRV	Revelation	18	6	Do to her as she has done to others . Pay her back double for what she has done . Pour her a double dose of what she has poured for others .
NIRV	Revelation	18	7	Give her as much pain and suffering as the glory and wealth she gave herself . She brags to herself , ‘ I rule on a throne like a queen . I am not a widow . I will never mourn. ’ ( Isaiah 47:7,8 )
NIRV	Revelation	18	8	But she will be plagued by death , sadness and hunger . In a single day she will suffer all these plagues . She will be burned up by fire . That ’ s because the Lord God who judges her is mighty . How Terrible When Babylon Falls !
NIRV	Revelation	18	9	“ The kings of the earth who committed terrible sins with her will weep . They will mourn because they used to share her riches . They will see the smoke rising as she burns .
NIRV	Revelation	18	10	They will be terrified by her suffering . They will stand far away from her . And they will cry out , “ ‘ How terrible ! How terrible it is for you , great city ! How terrible for you , mighty city of Babylon ! In just one hour you have been destroyed ! ’
NIRV	Revelation	18	11	“ The traders of the world will weep and mourn over her . No one buys what they sell anymore .
NIRV	Revelation	18	12	Here is what they had for sale . Gold , silver , jewels , pearls . Fine linen , purple , silk , bright red cloth . Every kind of citron wood . All sorts of things made out of ivory , valuable wood , bronze , iron , marble .
NIRV	Revelation	18	13	Cinnamon , spice , incense , myrrh , frankincense . Wine , olive oil , fine flour , wheat . Cattle , sheep , horses , carriages , and human beings sold as slaves .
NIRV	Revelation	18	14	“ The merchants will say , ‘ The pleasure you longed for has left you . All your riches and glory have disappeared forever. ’
NIRV	Revelation	18	15	The traders who sold these things became rich because of Babylon . When she suffers , they will stand far away . Her suffering will terrify them . They will weep and mourn .
NIRV	Revelation	18	16	They will cry out , “ ‘ How terrible ! How terrible it is for you , great city , dressed in fine linen , purple and bright red ! How terrible for you , great city , gleaming with gold , jewels and pearls !
NIRV	Revelation	18	17	In just one hour your great wealth has been destroyed ! ’ “ Every sea captain and all who travel by ship will stand far away . So will the sailors and all who earn their living from the sea .
NIRV	Revelation	18	19	They will throw dust on their heads . They will weep and mourn . They will cry out , “ ‘ How terrible ! How terrible it is for you , great city ! All who had ships on the sea became rich because of her wealth ! In just one hour she has been destroyed ! ’
NIRV	Revelation	18	20	“ You heavens , be glad for this ! You people of God , be glad ! You apostles and prophets , be glad ! God has judged her with the judgment she gave to you. ” Babylon ’ s Judgment Is Final
NIRV	Revelation	18	21	Then a mighty angel picked up a huge rock . It was the size of a large millstone . He threw it into the sea . Then he said , “ That is how the great city of Babylon will be thrown down . Never again will it be found .
NIRV	Revelation	18	22	The songs of musicians will never be heard in you again . Gone will be the music of harps , flutes and trumpets . No worker of any kind will ever be found in you again . The sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again .
NIRV	Revelation	18	23	The light of a lamp will never shine in you again . The voices of brides and grooms will never be heard in you again . Your traders were among the world ’ s most important people . By your magic spell all the nations were led astray .
NIRV	Revelation	18	24	You were guilty of the murder of prophets and God ’ s holy people . You were guilty of the blood of all who have been killed on the earth. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Revelation	19	19	Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies . They had gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army .
NIRV	Revelation	19	2	The way he judges is true and fair . He has judged the great prostitute . She made the earth impure with her terrible sins . God has paid her back for killing those who served him. ”
NIRV	Revelation	19	3	Again they shouted , “ Hallelujah ! The smoke from her fire goes up for ever and ever. ”
NIRV	Revelation	19	4	The
NIRV	Revelation	19	24	elders and the four living creatures bowed down . They worshiped God , who was sitting on the throne . They cried out , “ Amen ! Hallelujah ! ”
NIRV	Revelation	19	5	Then a voice came from the throne . It said , “ Praise our God , all you who serve him ! Praise God , all you who have respect for him , both great and small ! ”
NIRV	Revelation	19	6	Then I heard the noise of a huge crowd . It sounded like the roar of rushing waters and like loud thunder . The people were shouting , “ Hallelujah ! Our Lord God is the King who rules over all .
NIRV	Revelation	19	7	Let us be joyful and glad ! Let us give him glory ! It is time for the Lamb ’ s wedding . His bride has made herself ready .
NIRV	Revelation	19	8	Fine linen , bright and clean , was given to her to wear. ” Fine linen stands for the right things that God ’ s holy people do .
NIRV	Revelation	19	9	Here is what the angel told me to write . “ Blessed are those invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb ! ” Then he added , “ These are the true words of God. ”
NIRV	Revelation	19	10	When I heard this , I fell at his feet to worship him . But he said to me , “ Don ’ t do that ! I serve God , just as you do . I am God ’ s servant , just like believers who hold firmly to what Jesus has taught . Worship God ! The Spirit of prophecy tells the truth about Jesus. ” The Heavenly Warrior Has Victory Over the Beast
NIRV	Revelation	19	11	I saw heaven standing open . There in front of me was a white horse . Its rider is called Faithful and True . When he judges or makes war , he is always fair .
NIRV	Revelation	19	12	His eyes are like blazing fire . On his head are many crowns . A name is written on him that only he knows .
NIRV	Revelation	19	13	He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood . His name is the Word of God .
NIRV	Revelation	19	14	The armies of heaven were following him , riding on white horses . They were dressed in fine linen , white and clean .
NIRV	Revelation	19	15	Coming out of the rider ’ s mouth is a sharp sword . He will strike down the nations with the sword . Scripture says , “ He will rule them with an iron scepter. ” ( Psalm 2:9 ) He stomps on the grapes of God ’ s winepress . The winepress stands for the terrible anger of the God who rules over all .
NIRV	Revelation	19	16	Here is the name that is written on the rider ’ s robe and on his thigh . the greatest king of all and the most powerful lord of all
NIRV	Revelation	19	17	I saw an angel standing in the sun . He shouted to all the birds flying high in the air , “ Come ! Gather together for the great supper of God .
NIRV	Revelation	19	18	Come and eat the dead bodies of kings , generals , and other mighty people . Eat the bodies of horses and their riders . Eat the bodies of all people , free and slave , great and small. ”
NIRV	Revelation	19	20	But the beast and the false prophet were captured . The false prophet had done signs for the beast . In this way the false prophet had tricked some people . Those people had received the mark of the beast and had worshiped its statue . The beast and the false prophet were thrown alive into the lake of fire . The lake of fire burns with sulfur .
NIRV	Revelation	19	21	The rest were killed by the sword that came out of the rider ’ s mouth . All the birds stuffed themselves with the dead bodies . Copyright ©

NIRV	Revelation	20	20	I saw an angel coming down out of heaven . He had the key to the Abyss . In his hand he held a heavy chain .
NIRV	Revelation	20	2	He grabbed the dragon , that old serpent . The serpent is also called the devil , or Satan . The angel put him in chains for 1,000 years .
NIRV	Revelation	20	3	Then he threw him into the Abyss . He locked it and sealed him in . This was to keep Satan from causing the nations to believe his lies anymore . Satan will be locked away until the 1,000 years are ended . After that , he must be set free for a short time .
NIRV	Revelation	20	4	I saw thrones . Those who had been given authority to judge were sitting on them . I also saw the souls of those whose heads had been cut off . They had been killed because they had spoken what was true about Jesus . They had also been killed because of the word of God . They had not worshiped the beast or its statue . They had not received its mark on their foreheads or hands . They came to life and ruled with Christ for 1,000 years .
NIRV	Revelation	20	5	This is the first resurrection . The rest of the dead did not come to life until the 1,000 years were ended .
NIRV	Revelation	20	6	Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection . The second death has no power over them . They will be priests of God and of Christ . They will rule with him for 1,000 years . Satan Is Judged

NIRV	Revelation	20	9	They marched across the whole earth . They surrounded the place where God ’ s holy people were camped . It was the city he loves . But fire came down from heaven and burned them up .
NIRV	Revelation	20	10	The devil had caused them to believe lies . He was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur . That is where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown . They will all suffer day and night for ever and ever . The Dead Are Judged
NIRV	Revelation	20	11	I saw a great white throne . And I saw God sitting on it . When the earth and sky saw his face , they ran away . There was no place for them .
NIRV	Revelation	20	12	I saw the dead , great and small , standing in front of the throne . Books were opened . Then another book was opened . It was the book of life . The dead were judged by what they had done . The things they had done were written in the books .
NIRV	Revelation	20	13	The sea gave up the dead that were in it . And Death and Hell gave up their dead . Each person was judged by what they had done .
NIRV	Revelation	20	14	Then Death and Hell were thrown into the lake of fire . The lake of fire is the second death .

NIRV	Revelation	21	4	‘ He will wipe away every tear from their eyes . There will be no more death. ’ ( Isaiah 25:8 ) And there will be no more sadness . There will be no more crying or pain . Things are no longer the way they used to be. ”
