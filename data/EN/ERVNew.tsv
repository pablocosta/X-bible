ERV	Matthew	1	18	This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah happened . His mother Mary was engaged to marry Joseph . But before they married , he learned that she was expecting a baby . ( She was pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit . )
ERV	Matthew	1	19	Mary ’ s husband , Joseph , was a good man . He did not want to cause her public disgrace , so he planned to divorce her secretly .

ERV	Matthew	2	2	They asked people , “ Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews ? We saw the star that shows he was born . We saw it rise in the sky in the east and have come to worship him. ”
ERV	Matthew	2	3	When King Herod heard about this , it upset him as well as everyone else in Jerusalem .
ERV	Matthew	2	4	Herod called a meeting of all the leading Jewish priests and teachers of the law . He asked them where the Messiah would be born .
ERV	Matthew	2	5	They answered , “ In the town of Bethlehem in Judea , just as the prophet wrote :
ERV	Matthew	2	6	‘ Bethlehem , in the land of Judah , you are important among the rulers of Judah . Yes , a ruler will come from you , and that ruler will lead Israel , my people. ’ ” ( A )
ERV	Matthew	2	7	Then Herod had a private meeting with the wise men from the east . He learned from them the exact time they first saw the star .
ERV	Matthew	2	8	Then he sent them to Bethlehem . He said , “ Go and look carefully for the child . When you find him , come tell me . Then I can go worship him too. ”
ERV	Matthew	2	9	After the wise men heard the king , they left . They saw the same star they had seen in the east , and they followed it . The star went before them until it stopped above the place where the child was .
ERV	Matthew	2	10	They were very happy and excited to see the star .
ERV	Matthew	2	11	The wise men came to the house where the child was with his mother Mary . They bowed down and worshiped him . Then they opened the boxes of gifts they had brought for him . They gave him treasures of gold , frankincense , and myrrh .
ERV	Matthew	2	12	But God warned the wise men in a dream not to go back to Herod . So they went home to their own country a different way . Jesus ’ Parents Take Him to Egypt
ERV	Matthew	2	13	After the wise men left , an angel from the Lord came to Joseph in a dream . The angel said , “ Get up ! Take the child with his mother and escape to Egypt . Herod wants to kill the child and will soon start looking for him . Stay in Egypt until I tell you to come back. ”
ERV	Matthew	2	14	So Joseph got ready and left for Egypt with the child and the mother . They left during the night .
ERV	Matthew	2	15	Joseph stayed in Egypt until Herod died . This gave full meaning to what the Lord said through the prophet : “ I called my son to come out of Egypt. ” [ a ] Herod Kills the Baby Boys in Bethlehem
ERV	Matthew	2	16	Herod saw that the wise men had fooled him , and he was very angry . So he gave an order to kill all the baby boys in Bethlehem and the whole area around Bethlehem . Herod had learned from the wise men the time the baby was born . It was now two years from that time . So he said to kill all the boys who were two years old and younger .
ERV	Matthew	2	17	This gave full meaning to what God said through the prophet Jeremiah :
ERV	Matthew	2	18	“ A sound was heard in Ramah— bitter crying and great sadness . Rachel cries for her children , and she can not be comforted , because her children are gone. ” ( B ) Joseph and Mary Return From Egypt

ERV	Matthew	2	20	and said , “ Get up ! Take the child with his mother and go to Israel . Those who were trying to kill the child are now dead. ”
ERV	Matthew	2	21	So Joseph took the child and the mother and went to Israel .
ERV	Matthew	2	22	But he heard that Archelaus was now king in Judea . Archelaus became king when his father Herod died . So Joseph was afraid to go there . Then , after being warned in a dream , he went away to the area of Galilee .
ERV	Matthew	2	23	He went to a town called Nazareth and lived there . This gave full meaning to what God said through the prophets . God said the Messiah [ b ] would be called a Nazarene .

ERV	Matthew	3	8	Change your hearts ! And show by the way you live that you have changed .
ERV	Matthew	3	9	I know what you are thinking . You want to say , ‘ but Abraham is our father ! ’ That means nothing . I tell you , God could make children for Abraham from these rocks .
ERV	Matthew	3	10	The ax is now ready to cut down the trees . [ b ] Every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire .

ERV	Matthew	3	12	He will come ready to clean the grain . [ c ] He will separate the good grain from the straw , and he will put the good part into his barn . Then he will burn the useless part with a fire that can not be stopped. ” Jesus Is Baptized by John ( C )
ERV	Matthew	3	13	Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River . He came to John , wanting John to baptize him .
ERV	Matthew	3	14	But John tried to stop him . John said , “ Why do you come to me to be baptized ? I should be baptized by you ! ”
ERV	Matthew	3	15	Jesus answered , “ Let it be this way for now . We should do whatever God says is right. ” Then John agreed .
ERV	Matthew	3	16	So Jesus was baptized . As soon as he came up out of the water , the sky opened , and he saw God ’ s Spirit coming down on him like a dove .
ERV	Matthew	3	17	A voice from heaven said , “ This is my Son , the one I love .

ERV	Matthew	4	4	Jesus answered him , “ The Scriptures say , ‘ It is not just bread that keeps people alive . Their lives depend on what God says. ’ ” ( B )
ERV	Matthew	4	2	Jesus ate nothing for
ERV	Matthew	4	40	days and nights . After this , he was very hungry .
ERV	Matthew	4	3	The devil [ a ] came to tempt him and said , “ If you are the Son of God , tell these rocks to become bread. ”
ERV	Matthew	4	5	Then the devil led Jesus to the holy city of Jerusalem and put him on a high place at the edge of the Temple area .
ERV	Matthew	4	6	He said to Jesus , “ If you are the Son of God , jump off , because the Scriptures say , ‘ God will command his angels to help you , and their hands will catch you , so that you will not hit your foot on a rock. ’ ” ( C )
ERV	Matthew	4	7	Jesus answered , “ The Scriptures also say , ‘ You must not test the Lord your God. ’ ” [ b ]

ERV	Matthew	4	9	The devil said , “ If you will bow down and worship me , I will give you all these things. ”

ERV	Matthew	4	19	Jesus said to them , “ Come , follow me , and I will make you a different kind of fishermen . You will bring in people , not fish. ”
ERV	Matthew	4	20	Simon and Andrew immediately left their nets and followed him .

ERV	Matthew	6	25	“ So I tell you , don ’ t worry about the things you need to live—what you will eat , drink , or wear . Life is more important than food , and the body is more important than what you put on it .
ERV	Matthew	6	26	Look at the birds . They don ’ t plant , harvest , or save food in barns , but your heavenly Father feeds them . Don ’ t you know you are worth much more than they are ?

ERV	Matthew	6	30	If God makes what grows in the field so beautiful , what do you think he will do for you ? It ’ s just grass—one day it ’ s alive , and the next day someone throws it into a fire . But God cares enough to make it beautiful . Surely he will do much more for you . Your faith is so small !
ERV	Matthew	6	31	“ Don ’ t worry and say , ‘ What will we eat ? ’ or ‘ What will we drink ? ’ or ‘ What will we wear ? ’
ERV	Matthew	6	32	That ’ s what those people who don ’ t know God are always thinking about . Don ’ t worry , because your Father in heaven knows that you need all these things .
ERV	Matthew	6	33	What you should want most is God ’ s kingdom and doing what he wants you to do . Then he will give you all these other things you need .
ERV	Matthew	6	34	So don ’ t worry about tomorrow . Each day has enough trouble of its own . Tomorrow will have its own worries .

ERV	Matthew	12	10	In the synagogue there was a man with a crippled hand . Some Jews there were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus of doing wrong . So they asked him , “ Is it right to heal on the Sabbath day ? ” [ b ]
ERV	Matthew	12	11	Jesus answered , “ If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a ditch on the Sabbath day , you will take the sheep and help it out of the ditch .
ERV	Matthew	12	13	Then Jesus said to the man with the crippled hand , “ Hold out your hand. ” The man held out his hand , and it became well again , the same as the other hand .
ERV	Matthew	12	14	But the Pharisees left and made plans to kill Jesus . Jesus Is God ’ s Chosen Servant
ERV	Matthew	12	15	Jesus knew what the Pharisees were planning . So he left that place , and many people followed him . He healed all who were sick ,
ERV	Matthew	12	16	but he warned them not to tell others who he was .
ERV	Matthew	12	17	This was to give full meaning to what Isaiah the prophet said when he spoke for God :
ERV	Matthew	12	18	“ Here is my servant , the one I have chosen . He is the one I love , and I am very pleased with him . I will fill him with my Spirit , and he will bring justice to the nations .
ERV	Matthew	12	19	He will not argue or shout ; no one will hear his voice in the streets .
ERV	Matthew	12	20	He will not break off even a bent stem of grass . [ c ] He will not put out even the weakest flame . He will not give up until he has made justice victorious .
ERV	Matthew	12	21	All people will hope in him. ” ( C ) Jesus ’ Power Is From God ( D )
ERV	Matthew	12	22	Then some people brought a man to Jesus . This man was blind and could not talk , because he had a demon inside him . Jesus healed the man , and he could talk and see .
ERV	Matthew	12	23	All the people were amazed at what Jesus did . They said , “ Maybe he is the promised Son of David ! ”
ERV	Matthew	12	24	When the Pharisees heard this , they said , “ This man uses the power of Satan [ d ] to force demons out of people . Satan is the ruler of demons. ”
ERV	Matthew	12	25	Jesus knew what the Pharisees were thinking . So he said to them , “ Every kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed . And every city or family that is divided against itself will not survive .
ERV	Matthew	12	26	So if Satan forces out his own demons , [ e ] then he is fighting against himself , and his kingdom will not survive .
ERV	Matthew	12	27	. - Matthew 12:26 if Satan … demons Literally , “ if Satan forces out Satan. ” - Matthew 12:39 Jonah The story of Jonah is found in the Old Testament book of Jonah . - Matthew 12:41 Nineveh City where Jonah preached . See Jonah
ERV	Matthew	12	28	But I use the power of God ’ s Spirit to force out demons , and this shows that God ’ s kingdom has come to you .
ERV	Matthew	12	29	Whoever wants to enter a strong man ’ s house and steal his things must first tie him up . Then they can steal the things from his house .
ERV	Matthew	12	30	Whoever is not with me is against me . And anyone who does not work with me is working against me .
ERV	Matthew	12	31	“ So I tell you , people can be forgiven for every sinful thing they do and for every bad thing they say against God . But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
ERV	Matthew	12	32	You can even speak against the Son of Man and be forgiven . But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven—not now or in the future . What You Do Shows What You Are ( E )
ERV	Matthew	12	33	“ If you want good fruit , you must make the tree good . If your tree is not good , it will have bad fruit . A tree is known by the kind of fruit it produces .
ERV	Matthew	12	34	You snakes ! You are so evil . How can you say anything good ? What people say with their mouths comes from what fills their hearts .
ERV	Matthew	12	35	Those who are good have good things saved in their hearts . That ’ s why they say good things . But those who are evil have hearts full of evil , and that ’ s why they say things that are evil .
ERV	Matthew	12	36	I tell you that everyone will have to answer for all the careless things they have said . This will happen on the day of judgment .
ERV	Matthew	12	37	Your words will be used to judge you . What you have said will show whether you are right or whether you are guilty. ” Some People Doubt Jesus ’ Authority ( F )
ERV	Matthew	12	38	Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law answered Jesus . They said , “ Teacher , we want to see you do a miracle as a sign from God. ”
ERV	Matthew	12	39	Jesus answered , “ Evil and sinful people are the ones who want to see a miracle as a sign . But no miracle will be done to prove anything to them . The only sign will be the miracle that happened to the prophet Jonah . [ f ]
ERV	Matthew	12	40	Jonah was in the stomach of the big fish for three days and three nights . In the same way , the Son of Man will be in the grave three days and three nights .
ERV	Matthew	12	41	On the judgment day , you people who live now will be compared with the people from Nineveh , [ g ] and they will be witnesses who show how guilty you are . Why do I say this ? Because when Jonah preached to those people , they changed their lives . And you are listening to someone greater than Jonah , but you refuse to change !
ERV	Matthew	12	42	“ On the judgment day , you people who live now will also be compared with the queen of the South , [ h ] and she will be a witness who shows how guilty you are . I say this because she traveled from far , far away to listen to Solomon ’ s wise teaching . And I tell you that someone greater than Solomon is right here , but you won ’ t listen ! The Danger of Emptiness ( G )
ERV	Matthew	12	43	“ When an evil spirit comes out of a person , it travels through dry places looking for a place to rest , but it finds none .
ERV	Matthew	12	44	So it says , ‘ I will go back to the home I left. ’ When it comes back , it finds that home still empty . It is all neat and clean .
ERV	Matthew	12	45	Then the evil spirit goes out and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself . They all go and live there , and that person has even more trouble than before . It is the same way with the evil people who live today. ” Jesus ’ Followers Are His True Family ( H )
ERV	Matthew	12	46	While Jesus was talking to the people , his mother and brothers stood outside . They wanted to talk to him .
ERV	Matthew	12	47	Someone told him , “ Your mother and brothers are waiting for you outside . They want to talk to you. ”
ERV	Matthew	12	48	Jesus answered , “ Who is my mother ? Who are my brothers ? ”
ERV	Matthew	12	49	Then he pointed to his followers and said , “ See ! These people are my mother and my brothers .
ERV	Matthew	12	50	Yes , anyone who does what my Father in heaven wants is my true brother and sister and mother. ” Footnotes - Matthew 12:7 Quote from Hos . 6:6 . - Matthew 12:10 “ Is it right … day ? ” It was against Jewish law to work on the Sabbath day . - Matthew 12:20 stem of grass Literally , “ reed. ” - Matthew 12:24 Satan Literally , “ Beelzebul ” ( the devil ) .

ERV	Matthew	12	1000	miles (
ERV	Matthew	12	1600	km ) to learn God ’ s wisdom from Solomon . See
ERV	Matthew	12	1	Kings 10:1-13 .
ERV	Matthew	13	13	This is why I use these stories to teach the people : They see , but they don ’ t really see . They hear , but they don ’ t really hear or understand .
ERV	Matthew	13	2	A large crowd gathered around him . So he got into a boat and sat down . All the people stayed on the shore .
ERV	Matthew	13	3	Then Jesus used stories to teach them many things . He told them this story : “ A farmer went out to sow seed .
ERV	Matthew	13	4	While he was scattering the seed , some of it fell by the road . The birds came and ate all that seed .
ERV	Matthew	13	5	Other seed fell on rocky ground , where there was not enough dirt . It grew very fast there , because the soil was not deep .
ERV	Matthew	13	6	But when the sun rose , it burned the plants . The plants died because they did not have deep roots .
ERV	Matthew	13	7	Some other seed fell among thorny weeds . The weeds grew and stopped the good plants from growing .
ERV	Matthew	13	8	But some of the seed fell on good ground . There it grew and made grain . Some plants made
ERV	Matthew	13	100	times more , sometimes
ERV	Matthew	13	60	times more , and sometimes
ERV	Matthew	13	30	Let the weeds and the wheat grow together until the harvest time . At the harvest time I will tell the workers this : First , gather the weeds and tie them together to be burned . Then gather the wheat and bring it to my barn. ’ ” What Is God ’ s Kingdom Like ? ( E )
ERV	Matthew	13	9	You people who hear me , listen ! ” Why Jesus Used Stories to Teach ( B )
ERV	Matthew	13	10	The followers came to Jesus and asked , “ Why do you use these stories to teach the people ? ”
ERV	Matthew	13	11	Jesus answered , “ Only you can know the secret truths about God ’ s kingdom . Those other people can not know these secret truths .
ERV	Matthew	13	12	The people who have some understanding will be given more . And they will have even more than they need . But those who do not have much understanding will lose even the little understanding that they have .
ERV	Matthew	13	14	So they show that what Isaiah said about them is true : ‘ You people will listen and listen , but you will not understand . You will look and look , but you will not really see .
ERV	Matthew	13	15	Yes , the minds of these people are now closed . They have ears , but they don ’ t listen . They have eyes , but they refuse to see . If their minds were not closed , they might see with their eyes ; they might hear with their ears ; they might understand with their minds . Then they might turn back to me and be healed. ’ ( C )
ERV	Matthew	13	16	But God has blessed you . You understand what you see with your eyes . And you understand what you hear with your ears .
ERV	Matthew	13	17	I can assure you , many prophets and godly people wanted to see what you now see . But they did not see it . And many prophets and godly people wanted to hear what you now hear . But they did not hear it . Jesus Explains the Story About Seed ( D )
ERV	Matthew	13	18	“ So listen to the meaning of that story about the farmer :
ERV	Matthew	13	19	“ What about the seed that fell by the path ? That is like the people who hear the teaching about God ’ s kingdom but do not understand it . The Evil One comes and takes away what was planted in their hearts .
ERV	Matthew	13	20	“ And what about the seed that fell on rocky ground ? That is like the people who hear the teaching and quickly and gladly accept it .
ERV	Matthew	13	21	But they do not let the teaching go deep into their lives . They keep it only a short time . As soon as trouble or persecution comes because of the teaching they accepted , they give up .
ERV	Matthew	13	22	“ And what about the seed that fell among the thorny weeds ? That is like the people who hear the teaching but let worries about this life and love for money stop it from growing . So it does not produce a crop in their lives .
ERV	Matthew	13	23	“ But what about the seed that fell on the good ground ? That is like the people who hear the teaching and understand it . They grow and produce a good crop , sometimes
ERV	Matthew	13	24	Then Jesus used another story to teach them . Jesus said , “ God ’ s kingdom is like a man who planted good seed in his field .
ERV	Matthew	13	25	That night , while everyone was asleep , the man ’ s enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat and then left .
ERV	Matthew	13	26	Later , the wheat grew , and heads of grain grew on the plants . But at the same time the weeds also grew .
ERV	Matthew	13	27	Then the man ’ s servants came to him and said , ‘ You planted good seed in your field . Where did the weeds come from ? ’
ERV	Matthew	13	28	“ The man answered , ‘ An enemy planted weeds. ’ “ The servants asked , ‘ Do you want us to go and pull up the weeds ? ’
ERV	Matthew	13	29	“ He answered , ‘ No , because when you pull up the weeds , you might also pull up the wheat .
ERV	Matthew	13	31	Then Jesus told the people another story : “ God ’ s kingdom is like a mustard seed that a man plants in his field .
ERV	Matthew	13	32	It is the smallest of all seeds . But when it grows , it is the largest of all garden plants . It becomes a tree big enough for the birds to come and make nests in its branches. ”
ERV	Matthew	13	33	Then Jesus told them another story : “ God ’ s kingdom is like yeast that a woman mixes into a big bowl of flour to make bread . The yeast makes all the dough rise. ”
ERV	Matthew	13	34	Jesus used stories to tell all these things to the people . He always used stories to teach them .
ERV	Matthew	13	35	This was to make clear the full meaning of what the prophet said : “ I will speak using stories ; I will tell things that have been secrets since the world was made. ” ( F ) Jesus Explains a Hard Story
ERV	Matthew	13	36	Then Jesus left the people and went into the house . His followers came to him and said , “ Explain to us the meaning of the story about the weeds in the field. ”
ERV	Matthew	13	37	He answered , “ The man who planted the good seed in the field is the Son of Man .
ERV	Matthew	13	38	The field is the world . The good seed are the people in God ’ s kingdom . The weeds are the people who belong to the Evil One .
ERV	Matthew	13	39	And the enemy who planted the bad seed is the devil . The harvest is the end of time . And the workers who gather are God ’ s angels .
ERV	Matthew	13	40	“ The weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire . It will be the same at the end of time .
ERV	Matthew	13	41	The Son of Man will send his angels , and they will find the people who cause sin and all those who do evil . The angels will take those people out of his kingdom .
ERV	Matthew	13	42	They will throw them into the place of fire . There the people will be crying and grinding their teeth with pain .
ERV	Matthew	13	43	Then the godly people will shine like the sun . They will be in the kingdom of their Father . You people who hear me , listen ! Stories About a Treasure and a Pearl
ERV	Matthew	13	44	“ God ’ s kingdom is like a treasure hidden in a field . One day a man found the treasure . He hid it again and was so happy that he went and sold everything he owned and bought the field .
ERV	Matthew	13	45	“ Also , God ’ s kingdom is like a merchant looking for fine pearls .
ERV	Matthew	13	46	One day he found a very fine pearl . He went and sold everything he had to buy it . A Story About a Fishing Net
ERV	Matthew	13	47	“ Also , God ’ s kingdom is like a net that was put into the lake . The net caught many different kinds of fish .
ERV	Matthew	13	48	It was full , so the fishermen pulled it to the shore . They sat down and put all the good fish in baskets . Then they threw away the bad fish .
ERV	Matthew	13	49	It will be the same at the end of time . The angels will come and separate the evil people from the godly people .
ERV	Matthew	13	50	They will throw the evil people into the place of fire . There the people will cry and grind their teeth with pain. ”
ERV	Matthew	13	51	Then Jesus asked his followers , “ Do you understand all these things ? ” They said , “ Yes , we understand. ”
ERV	Matthew	13	52	Then Jesus said to the followers , “ So every teacher of the law who has learned about God ’ s kingdom has some new things to teach . He is like the owner of a house . He has new things and old things saved in that house . And he brings out the new with the old. ” Jesus Goes to His Hometown ( G )
ERV	Matthew	13	53	When Jesus finished teaching with these stories , he left there .
ERV	Matthew	13	54	He went to the town where he grew up . He taught the people in the synagogue , and they were amazed . They said , “ Where did this man get such wisdom and this power to do miracles ?
ERV	Matthew	13	55	Isn ’ t he just the son of the carpenter we know ? Isn ’ t his mother ’ s name Mary , and aren ’ t his brothers James , Joseph , Simon , and Judas ?
ERV	Matthew	13	56	And don ’ t all his sisters still live here in town ? How is he able to do these things ? ”
ERV	Matthew	13	57	So they had a problem accepting him . But Jesus said to them , “ People everywhere give honor to a prophet , but in his own town or in his own home a prophet does not get any honor. ”
ERV	Matthew	13	58	Jesus did not do many miracles there , because the people did not believe in him .
ERV	Matthew	14	14	When Jesus got out of the boat , he saw a large crowd of people . He felt sorry for them , and he healed the ones who were sick .
ERV	Matthew	14	2	So he said to his servants , “ This man is really John the Baptizer . He must have risen from death , and that is why he can do these miracles. ” How John the Baptizer Was Killed
ERV	Matthew	14	3	Before this time , Herod had arrested John . He had him chained and put in prison . He arrested John because of Herodias , the wife of Philip , Herod ’ s brother .
ERV	Matthew	14	4	John had told him , “ It is not right for you to be married to Herodias. ”
ERV	Matthew	14	5	Herod wanted to kill him , but he was afraid of the people . They believed that John was a prophet .
ERV	Matthew	14	6	On Herod ’ s birthday , the daughter of Herodias danced for him and his group . Herod was very pleased with her .
ERV	Matthew	14	7	So he promised that he would give her anything she wanted .
ERV	Matthew	14	8	Herodias told her daughter what to ask for . So she said to Herod , “ Give me the head of John the Baptizer here on this plate. ”
ERV	Matthew	14	9	King Herod was very sad . But he had promised to give the daughter anything she wanted . And the people eating with Herod had heard his promise . So he ordered what she asked to be done .
ERV	Matthew	14	10	He sent men to the prison , where they cut off John ’ s head .
ERV	Matthew	14	11	And the men brought John ’ s head on a plate and gave it to the girl . Then she took the head to her mother , Herodias .
ERV	Matthew	14	12	John ’ s followers came and got his body and buried it . Then they went and told Jesus what happened . Jesus Feeds More Than
ERV	Matthew	14	5000	men there who ate . There were also women and children who ate . Jesus Walks on Water ( C )
ERV	Matthew	14	13	When Jesus heard what happened to John , he left in a boat . He went alone to a place where no one lived . But the people heard that Jesus had left . So they left their towns and followed him . They went by land to the same place he went .
ERV	Matthew	14	15	Late that afternoon , the followers came to Jesus and said , “ No one lives in this place . And it is already late . Send the people away so they can go to the towns and buy food for themselves. ”
ERV	Matthew	14	16	Jesus said , “ The people don ’ t need to go away . You give them some food to eat. ”
ERV	Matthew	14	17	The followers answered , “ But we have only five loaves of bread and two fish. ”
ERV	Matthew	14	18	Jesus said , “ Bring the bread and the fish to me. ”
ERV	Matthew	14	19	Then he told the people to sit down on the grass . He took the five loaves of bread and the two fish . He looked into the sky and thanked God for the food . Then he broke the bread into pieces , which he gave to the followers , and they gave the food to the people .
ERV	Matthew	14	20	Everyone ate until they were full . When they finished eating , the followers filled twelve baskets with the pieces of food that were not eaten .
ERV	Matthew	14	21	There were about
ERV	Matthew	14	22	Then Jesus made the followers get into the boat . He told them to go to the other side of the lake . He said he would come later . He stayed there to tell everyone they could go home .
ERV	Matthew	14	23	After Jesus said goodbye to the people , he went up into the hills by himself to pray . It was late , and he was there alone .
ERV	Matthew	14	24	By this time the boat was already a long way from shore . Since the wind was blowing against it , the boat was having trouble because of the waves .
ERV	Matthew	14	25	Between three and six o ’ clock in the morning , Jesus ’ followers were still in the boat . Jesus came to them . He was walking on the water .
ERV	Matthew	14	26	When they saw him walking on the water , it scared them . “ It ’ s a ghost ! ” they said , screaming in fear .
ERV	Matthew	14	27	But Jesus quickly spoke to them . He said , “ Don ’ t worry ! It ’ s me ! Don ’ t be afraid. ”
ERV	Matthew	14	28	Peter said , “ Lord , if that is really you , tell me to come to you on the water. ”
ERV	Matthew	14	29	Jesus said , “ Come , Peter. ” Then Peter left the boat and walked on the water to Jesus .
ERV	Matthew	14	30	But while Peter was walking on the water , he saw the wind and the waves . He was afraid and began sinking into the water . He shouted , “ Lord , save me ! ”
ERV	Matthew	14	31	Then Jesus caught Peter with his hand . He said , “ Your faith is small . Why did you doubt ? ”
ERV	Matthew	14	32	After Peter and Jesus were in the boat , the wind stopped .
ERV	Matthew	14	33	Then the followers in the boat worshiped Jesus and said , “ You really are the Son of God. ” Jesus Heals Many Sick People ( D )
ERV	Matthew	14	34	After they crossed the lake , they came to the shore at Gennesaret .
ERV	Matthew	14	35	Some men there saw Jesus and knew who he was . So they sent word to the other people throughout that area that Jesus had come . The people brought all their sick people to him .
ERV	Matthew	14	36	They begged Jesus to let them only touch the edge of his coat to be healed . And all the sick people who touched his coat were healed .
ERV	Matthew	15	15	Peter said , “ Explain to us what you said earlier to the people. ”
ERV	Matthew	15	2	“ Why do your followers not obey the traditions we have from our great leaders who lived long ago ? Your followers don ’ t wash their hands before they eat ! ”
ERV	Matthew	15	3	Jesus answered , “ And why do you refuse to obey God ’ s command so that you can follow those traditions you have ?
ERV	Matthew	15	4	God said , ‘ You must respect your father and mother. ’ [ a ] And God also said , ‘ Whoever says anything bad to their father or mother must be killed. ’ [ b ]
ERV	Matthew	15	5	But you teach that a person can say to their father or mother , ‘ I have something I could use to help you . But I will not use it for you . I will give it to God. ’
ERV	Matthew	15	6	You are teaching them not to respect their father . So you are teaching that it is not important to do what God said . You think it is more important to follow those traditions you have .
ERV	Matthew	15	7	You are hypocrites ! Isaiah was right when he spoke for God about you :
ERV	Matthew	15	8	‘ These people honor me with their words , but I am not really important to them .
ERV	Matthew	15	9	Their worship of me is worthless . The things they teach are only human rules. ’ ” ( B )
ERV	Matthew	15	10	Jesus called the people to him . He said , “ Listen and understand what I am saying .
ERV	Matthew	15	11	It is not what people put in their mouth that makes them wrong . [ c ] It is what comes out of their mouth that makes them wrong. ”
ERV	Matthew	15	12	Then the followers came to Jesus and asked , “ Do you know that the Pharisees are upset about what you said ? ”
ERV	Matthew	15	13	Jesus answered , “ Every plant that my Father in heaven has not planted will be pulled up by the roots .
ERV	Matthew	15	14	Stay away from the Pharisees . They lead the people , but they are like blind men leading other blind men . And if a blind man leads another blind man , both of them will fall into a ditch. ”
ERV	Matthew	15	16	Jesus said , “ Do you still have trouble understanding ?
ERV	Matthew	15	17	Surely you know that all the food that enters the mouth goes into the stomach . Then it goes out of the body .
ERV	Matthew	15	18	. - Matthew 15:24 people Literally , “ sheep . ”
ERV	Matthew	15	19	All these bad things begin in the mind : evil thoughts , murder , adultery , sexual sins , stealing , lying , and insulting people .
ERV	Matthew	15	20	These are the things that make people wrong . Eating without washing their hands will never make people unacceptable to God. ” Jesus Helps a Non-Jewish Woman ( C )
ERV	Matthew	15	21	Jesus went from there to the area of Tyre and Sidon .
ERV	Matthew	15	22	A Canaanite woman from that area came out and began shouting , “ Lord , Son of David , please help me ! My daughter has a demon inside her , and she is suffering very much. ”
ERV	Matthew	15	23	But Jesus did not answer her . So the followers came to him and said , “ Tell her to go away . She keeps crying out and will not leave us alone. ”
ERV	Matthew	15	24	Jesus answered , “ God sent me only to the lost people [ d ] of Israel. ”
ERV	Matthew	15	25	Then the woman came over to Jesus and bowed before him . She said , “ Lord , help me ! ”
ERV	Matthew	15	26	He answered her with this saying : “ It is not right to take the children ’ s bread and give it to the dogs. ”
ERV	Matthew	15	27	The woman said , “ Yes , Lord , but even the dogs eat the pieces of food that fall from their master ’ s table. ”
ERV	Matthew	15	28	Then Jesus answered , “ Woman , you have great faith ! You will get what you asked for. ” And right then the woman ’ s daughter was healed . Jesus Heals Many People
ERV	Matthew	15	29	Then Jesus went from there to the shore of Lake Galilee . He went up on a hill and sat down .
ERV	Matthew	15	30	A large crowd of people came to him . They brought many other sick people and put them before him . There were people who could not walk , people who were blind , crippled , or deaf , and many others . Jesus healed them all .
ERV	Matthew	15	31	People were amazed when they saw that those who could not speak were now able to speak . Crippled people were made strong . Those who could not walk were now able to walk . The blind were able to see . Everyone thanked the God of Israel for this . Jesus Feeds More Than
ERV	Matthew	15	4000	men there who ate . There were also some women and children .
ERV	Matthew	15	32	Jesus called his followers to him and said , “ I feel sorry for these people . They have been with me three days , and now they have nothing to eat . I don ’ t want to send them away hungry . They might faint while going home. ”
ERV	Matthew	15	33	The followers asked Jesus , “ Where can we get enough bread to feed all these people ? We are a long way from any town. ”
ERV	Matthew	15	34	Jesus asked , “ How many loaves of bread do you have ? ” They answered , “ We have seven loaves of bread and a few small fish. ”
ERV	Matthew	15	35	Jesus told the people to sit on the ground .
ERV	Matthew	15	36	He took the seven loaves of bread and the fish . Then he gave thanks to God for the food . He broke the bread into pieces , which he gave to the followers , and they gave the food to the people .
ERV	Matthew	15	37	All the people ate until they were full . After this , the followers filled seven baskets with the pieces of food that were not eaten .
ERV	Matthew	15	38	There were about

Also in verse
ERV	Matthew	16	16	Simon Peter answered , “ You are the Messiah , the Son of the living God. ”
ERV	Matthew	16	2	Jesus answered , “ When you people see the sunset , you know what the weather will be . If the sky is red , you say we will have good weather .
ERV	Matthew	16	3	And in the morning , if the sky is dark and red , you say that it will be a rainy day . These are signs of the weather . You see these signs in the sky and know what they mean . In the same way , you see the things that are happening now . These are also signs , but you don ’ t know their meaning .
ERV	Matthew	16	4	It is the evil and sinful people who want to see a miracle as a sign from God . But no miracle will be done to prove anything to them . The only sign will be the miracle that happened to Jonah . [ a ] ” Then Jesus went away from there . Jesus ’ Followers Misunderstand Him ( B )
ERV	Matthew	16	5	Jesus and his followers went across the lake . But the followers forgot to bring bread .

ERV	Matthew	17	10	The followers asked Jesus , “ Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come [ a ] before the Messiah comes ? ”
ERV	Matthew	17	11	Jesus answered , “ They are right to say Elijah is coming . And it is true that Elijah will make all things the way they should be .
ERV	Matthew	17	12	But I tell you , Elijah has already come . People did not know who he was , and they treated him badly , doing whatever they wanted to do . It is the same with the Son of Man . Those same people will make the Son of Man suffer. ”

ERV	Matthew	17	20	Jesus answered , “ You were not able to make the demon go out , because your faith is too small . Believe me when I tell you , if your faith is only as big as a mustard seed you can say to this mountain , ‘ Move from here to there , ’ and it will move . You will be able to do anything. ”

ERV	Matthew	21	20	When the followers saw this , they were very surprised . They asked , “ How did the fig tree dry up and die so quickly ? ”
ERV	Matthew	21	22	If you believe , you will get anything you ask for in prayer. ” Jewish Leaders Doubt Jesus ’ Authority ( F )
ERV	Matthew	21	23	Jesus went into the Temple area . While Jesus was teaching there , the leading priests and the older leaders of the people came to him . They said , “ Tell us ! What authority do you have to do these things you are doing ? Who gave you this authority ? ”
ERV	Matthew	21	24	Jesus answered , “ I will ask you a question too . If you answer me , then I will tell you what authority I have to do these things .
ERV	Matthew	21	25	Tell me : When John baptized people , did his authority come from God , or was it only from other people ? ” The priests and the Jewish leaders talked about Jesus ’ question . They said to each other , “ If we answer , ‘ John ’ s baptism was from God , ’ then he will say , ‘ Then why didn ’ t you believe John ? ’
ERV	Matthew	21	26	But we can ’ t say John ’ s baptism was from someone else . We are afraid of the people , because they all believe John was a prophet. ”
ERV	Matthew	21	27	So they told Jesus , “ We don ’ t know the answer. ” Jesus said , “ Then I will not tell you who gave me the authority to do these things . Jesus Uses a Story About Two Sons
ERV	Matthew	21	28	“ Tell me what you think about this : There was a man who had two sons . He went to the first son and said , ‘ Son , go and work today in the vineyard. ’
ERV	Matthew	21	29	“ The son answered , ‘ I will not go. ’ But later he decided he should go , and he went .
ERV	Matthew	21	30	“ Then the father went to the other son and said , ‘ Son , go and work today in the vineyard. ’ He answered , ‘ Yes , sir , I will go and work. ’ But he did not go .
ERV	Matthew	21	31	“ Which of the two sons obeyed his father ? ” The Jewish leaders answered , “ The first son. ” Jesus said to them , “ The truth is , you are worse than the tax collectors and the prostitutes . In fact , they will enter God ’ s kingdom before you enter .
ERV	Matthew	21	32	John came showing you the right way to live , and you did not believe him . But the tax collectors and prostitutes believed John . You saw that happening , but you would not change . You still refused to believe him . God Sends His Son ( G )
ERV	Matthew	21	33	“ Listen to this story : There was a man who owned a vineyard . He put a wall around the field and dug a hole for a winepress . Then he built a tower . He leased the land to some farmers and then left on a trip .
ERV	Matthew	21	34	Later , it was time for the grapes to be picked . So the man sent his servants to the farmers to get his share of the grapes .
ERV	Matthew	21	35	“ But the farmers grabbed the servants and beat one . They killed another one and then stoned to death a third servant .
ERV	Matthew	21	36	So the man sent some other servants to the farmers . He sent more servants than he sent the first time . But the farmers did the same thing to them that they did the first time .
ERV	Matthew	21	37	So the man decided to send his son to the farmers . He said , ‘ The farmers will respect my son. ’
ERV	Matthew	21	38	“ But when the farmers saw the son , they said to each other , ‘ This is the owner ’ s son . This vineyard will be his . If we kill him , it will be ours. ’
ERV	Matthew	21	39	So the farmers took the son , threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
ERV	Matthew	21	40	“ So what will the owner of the vineyard do to these farmers when he comes ? ”
ERV	Matthew	21	41	The Jewish priests and leaders said , “ He will surely kill those evil men . Then he will lease the land to other farmers , who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time. ”
ERV	Matthew	21	42	Jesus said to them , “ Surely you have read this in the Scriptures : ‘ The stone that the builders refused to accept became the cornerstone . The Lord did this , and it is wonderful to us. ’ ( H )
ERV	Matthew	21	43	“ So I tell you that God ’ s kingdom will be taken away from you . It will be given to people who do what God wants in his kingdom .
ERV	Matthew	21	44	.
ERV	Matthew	21	45	When the leading priests and the Pharisees heard these stories , they knew that Jesus was talking about them .
ERV	Matthew	21	46	They wanted to find a way to arrest Jesus . But they were afraid to do anything , because the people believed that Jesus was a prophet .

ERV	Matthew	22	22	When they heard what Jesus said , they were amazed . They left him and went away . Some Sadducees Try to Trick Jesus ( C )
ERV	Matthew	22	2	“ God ’ s kingdom is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son .
ERV	Matthew	22	3	He invited some people to the feast . When it was ready , the king sent his servants to tell the people to come . But they refused to come to the king ’ s feast .
ERV	Matthew	22	4	“ Then the king sent some more servants . He said to them , ‘ I have already invited the people . So tell them that my feast is ready . I have killed my best bulls and calves to be eaten . Everything is ready . Come to the wedding feast. ’
ERV	Matthew	22	5	“ But when the servants told the people to come , they refused to listen . They all went to do other things . One went to work in his field , and another went to his business .

ERV	Matthew	22	7	The king was very angry . He sent his army to kill those who murdered his servants . And the army burned their city .
ERV	Matthew	22	8	“ After that the king said to his servants , ‘ The wedding feast is ready . I invited those people , but they were not good enough to come to my feast .
ERV	Matthew	22	9	So go to the street corners and invite everyone you see . Tell them to come to my feast. ’
ERV	Matthew	22	10	So the servants went into the streets . They gathered all the people they could find , good and bad alike , and brought them to where the wedding feast was ready . And the place was filled with guests .
ERV	Matthew	22	11	“ When the king came in to meet the guests , he saw a man there who was not dressed in the right clothes for a wedding .
ERV	Matthew	22	12	The king said , ‘ Friend , how were you allowed to come in here ? You are not wearing the right clothes. ’ But the man said nothing .
ERV	Matthew	22	13	So the king told some servants , ‘ Tie this man ’ s hands and feet . Throw him out into the darkness , where people are crying and grinding their teeth with pain. ’
ERV	Matthew	22	14	“ Yes , many people are invited . But only a few are chosen. ” The Jewish Leaders Try to Trick Jesus ( B )
ERV	Matthew	22	15	Then the Pharisees left the place where Jesus was teaching . They made plans to catch him saying something wrong .
ERV	Matthew	22	16	They sent some men to Jesus . They were some of their own followers and some from the group called Herodians . They said , “ Teacher , we know you are an honest man . We know you teach the truth about God ’ s way . You are not afraid of what others think about you . All people are the same to you .
ERV	Matthew	22	17	So tell us what you think . Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ”
ERV	Matthew	22	18	But Jesus knew that these men were trying to trick him . So he said , “ You hypocrites ! Why are you trying to catch me saying something wrong ?
ERV	Matthew	22	19	Show me a coin used for paying the tax. ” They showed Jesus a silver coin .
ERV	Matthew	22	20	Then he asked , “ Whose picture is on the coin ? And whose name is written on the coin ? ”
ERV	Matthew	22	21	They answered , “ It is Caesar ’ s picture and Caesar ’ s name. ” Then Jesus said to them , “ Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar , and give to God what belongs to God. ”
ERV	Matthew	22	23	That same day some Sadducees came to Jesus . ( Sadducees believe that no one will rise from death . ) The Sadducees asked Jesus a question .
ERV	Matthew	22	24	They said , “ Teacher , Moses told us that if a married man dies and had no children , his brother must marry the woman . Then they will have children for the dead brother . [ a ]
ERV	Matthew	22	25	There were seven brothers among us . The first brother married but died . He had no children . So his brother married the woman .
ERV	Matthew	22	26	Then the second brother also died . The same thing happened to the third brother and all the other brothers .
ERV	Matthew	22	27	The woman was the last to die .
ERV	Matthew	22	28	But all seven men had married her . So when people rise from death , whose wife will she be ? ”
ERV	Matthew	22	29	Jesus answered , “ You are so wrong ! You don ’ t know what the Scriptures say . And you don ’ t know anything about God ’ s power .
ERV	Matthew	22	30	At the time when people rise from death , there will be no marriage . People will not be married to each other . Everyone will be like the angels in heaven .
ERV	Matthew	22	31	Surely you have read what God said to you about people rising from death .
ERV	Matthew	22	32	God said , ‘ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob. ’ [ b ] So they were not still dead , because he is the God only of living people. ”
ERV	Matthew	22	33	When the people heard this , they were amazed at Jesus ’ teaching . Which Command Is the Most Important ? ( D )
ERV	Matthew	22	34	The Pharisees learned that Jesus had made the Sadducees look so foolish that they stopped trying to argue with him . So the Pharisees had a meeting .
ERV	Matthew	22	35	Then one of them , an expert in the Law of Moses , asked Jesus a question to test him .
ERV	Matthew	22	36	He said , “ Teacher , which command in the law is the most important ? ”
ERV	Matthew	22	37	Jesus answered , “ ‘ Love the Lord your God with all your heart , all your soul , and all your mind. ’ [ c ]
ERV	Matthew	22	38	This is the first and most important command .
ERV	Matthew	22	39	And the second command is like the first : ‘ Love your neighbor [ d ] the same as you love yourself. ’ [ e ]
ERV	Matthew	22	40	All of the law and the writings of the prophets take their meaning from these two commands. ” Is the Messiah David ’ s Son or David ’ s Lord ? ( E )
ERV	Matthew	22	41	So while the Pharisees were together , Jesus asked them a question .
ERV	Matthew	22	42	He said , “ What do you think about the Messiah ? Whose son is he ? ” The Pharisees answered , “ The Messiah is the Son of David. ”
ERV	Matthew	22	43	Jesus said to them , “ Then why did David call him ‘ Lord ’ ? David was speaking by the power of the Spirit . He said ,
ERV	Matthew	22	44	‘ The Lord God said to my Lord : Sit by me at my right side , and I will put your enemies under your control . [ f ] ’ ( F )
ERV	Matthew	22	45	David calls the Messiah ‘ Lord. ’ So how can he be David ’ s son ? ”
ERV	Matthew	22	46	None of the Pharisees could answer Jesus ’ question . And after that day , no one was brave enough to ask him any more questions . Footnotes - Matthew 22:24 if … dead brother See Deut . 25:5 ,

And you should also continue to do those other things .
ERV	Matthew	23	2	“ The teachers of the law and the Pharisees have the authority to tell you what the Law of Moses says .
ERV	Matthew	23	3	So you should obey them . Do everything they tell you to do . But their lives are not good examples for you to follow . They tell you to do things , but they don ’ t do those things themselves .

ERV	Mark	1	37	They found him and said , “ Everyone is looking for you ! ”
ERV	Mark	1	38	Jesus answered , “ We should go to another place . We can go to other towns around here , and I can tell God ’ s message to those people too . That is why I came. ”

Also in verses
ERV	Mark	2	2	A large crowd gathered to hear him speak . The house was so full that there was no place to stand , not even outside the door . While Jesus was teaching ,
ERV	Mark	2	3	some people brought a paralyzed man to see him . He was being carried by four of them .
ERV	Mark	2	4	But they could not get the man inside to Jesus because the house was so full of people . So they went to the roof above Jesus and made a hole in it . Then they lowered the mat with the paralyzed man on it .
ERV	Mark	2	5	When Jesus saw how much faith they had , he said to the paralyzed man , “ Young man , your sins are forgiven. ”
ERV	Mark	2	6	Some of the teachers of the law were sitting there . They saw what Jesus did , and they said to themselves ,
ERV	Mark	2	7	“ Why does this man say things like that ? What an insult to God ! No one but God can forgive sins. ”
ERV	Mark	2	8	Jesus knew immediately what these teachers of the law were thinking . So he said to them , “ Why do you have these questions in your minds ? 9-10 The Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins . But how can I prove this to you ? Maybe you are thinking it was easy for me to say to the crippled man , ‘ Your sins are forgiven. ’ There ’ s no proof it really happened . But what if I say to the man , ‘ Stand up . Take your mat and walk ’ ? Then you will be able to see if I really have this power or not. ” So Jesus said to the paralyzed man ,
ERV	Mark	2	11	“ I tell you , stand up . Take your mat and go home. ”
ERV	Mark	2	12	Immediately the paralyzed man stood up . He picked up his mat and walked out of the room . Everyone could see him . They were amazed and praised God . They said , “ This is the most amazing thing we have ever seen ! ” Levi ( Matthew ) Follows Jesus ( B )

ERV	Mark	2	15	Later that day , Jesus and his followers ate at Levi ’ s house . There were also many tax collectors and others with bad reputations eating with them . ( There were many of these people who followed Jesus . )
ERV	Mark	2	16	When some teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw Jesus eating with such bad people , they asked his followers , “ Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
ERV	Mark	2	17	When Jesus heard this , he said to them , “ It is the sick people who need a doctor , not those who are healthy . I did not come to invite good people . I came to invite sinners. ” Jesus Is Not Like Other Religious Leaders ( C )
ERV	Mark	2	18	The followers of John and the Pharisees were fasting . Some people came to Jesus and said , “ John ’ s followers fast , and the followers of the Pharisees fast . But your followers don ’ t fast . Why ? ”

ERV	Mark	2	25	Jesus answered , “ You have read what David did when he and the people with him were hungry and needed food .
ERV	Mark	2	26	It was during the time of Abiathar the high priest . David went into God ’ s house and ate the bread that was offered to God . And the Law of Moses says that only priests can eat that bread . David also gave some of the bread to the people with him. ”
ERV	Mark	2	27	Then Jesus said to the Pharisees , “ The Sabbath day was made to help people . People were not made to be ruled by the Sabbath .
ERV	Mark	2	28	So the Son of Man is Lord of every day , even the Sabbath . ”
ERV	Mark	3	3	Jesus said to the man with the crippled hand , “ Stand up here so that everyone can see you. ”
ERV	Mark	3	2	Some Jews there were watching Jesus closely . They were waiting to see if he would heal the man on a Sabbath day . They wanted to see Jesus do something wrong so that they could accuse him .
ERV	Mark	3	4	Then Jesus asked the people , “ Which is the right thing to do on the Sabbath day : to do good or to do evil ? Is it right to save a life or to destroy one ? ” The people said nothing to answer him .
ERV	Mark	3	5	Jesus looked at the people . He was angry , but he felt very sad because they were so stubborn . He said to the man , “ Hold out your hand. ” The man held out his hand , and it was healed .

ERV	Mark	3	7	Jesus went away with his followers to the lake . A large crowd of people from Galilee followed them .
ERV	Mark	3	8	Many also came from Judea , from Jerusalem , from Idumea , from the area across the Jordan River , and from the area around Tyre and Sidon . These people came because they heard about all that Jesus was doing .
ERV	Mark	3	9	Jesus saw how many people there were , so he told his followers to get a small boat and make it ready for him . He wanted the boat so that the crowds of people could not push against him .
ERV	Mark	3	10	He had healed many of them , so all the sick people were pushing toward him to touch him .
ERV	Mark	3	11	Some people had evil spirits inside them . When the evil spirits saw Jesus , they bowed before him and shouted , “ You are the Son of God ! ”
ERV	Mark	3	12	But Jesus gave the spirits a strong warning not to tell anyone who he was . Jesus Chooses His Twelve Apostles ( B )
ERV	Mark	3	13	Then Jesus went up on a hill and invited those he wanted to go with him . So they joined him there .
ERV	Mark	3	14	And he chose twelve men and called them apostles . He wanted these twelve men to be with him , and he wanted to send them to other places to tell people God ’ s message .
ERV	Mark	3	15	He also wanted them to have the power to force demons out of people .
ERV	Mark	3	16	These are the names of the twelve men Jesus chose : Simon ( the one Jesus named Peter ) ,
ERV	Mark	3	17	James and his brother John , the sons of Zebedee ( the ones Jesus named Boanerges , which means “ Sons of Thunder ” ) ,
ERV	Mark	3	18	Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , James , the son of Alphaeus , Thaddaeus , Simon , the Zealot ,

ERV	Mark	3	20	Then Jesus went home , but again a large crowd gathered there . There were so many people that he and his followers could not eat .
ERV	Mark	3	21	His family heard about all these things . They went to get him because people said he was crazy .
ERV	Mark	3	22	And the teachers of the law from Jerusalem said , “ Satan [ a ] is living inside him ! He uses power from the ruler of demons to force demons out of people. ”
ERV	Mark	3	23	So Jesus called them together and talked to them using some stories . He said , “ Satan will not force his own demons out of people .
ERV	Mark	3	24	A kingdom that fights against itself will not survive .
ERV	Mark	3	25	And a family that is divided will not survive .
ERV	Mark	3	26	If Satan is against himself and is fighting against his own people , he will not survive . That would be the end of Satan .
ERV	Mark	3	27	“ Whoever wants to enter a strong man ’ s house and steal his things must first tie him up . Then they can steal the things from his house .
ERV	Mark	3	28	“ I want you to know that people can be forgiven for all the sinful things they do . They can even be forgiven for the bad things they say against God .
ERV	Mark	3	29	But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven . They will always be guilty of that sin. ”
ERV	Mark	3	30	Jesus said this because the teachers of the law had accused him of having an evil spirit inside him . Jesus ’ Followers Are His True Family ( D )
ERV	Mark	3	31	Then Jesus ’ mother and brothers came . They stood outside and sent someone in to tell him to come out .
ERV	Mark	3	32	Many people were sitting around Jesus . They said to him , “ Your mother , your brothers , and your sisters [ b ] are waiting for you outside. ”
ERV	Mark	3	33	Jesus asked , “ Who is my mother ? Who are my brothers ? ”
ERV	Mark	3	34	Then he looked at the people sitting around him and said , “ These people are my mother and my brothers !
ERV	Mark	3	35	My true brother and sister and mother are those who do what God wants . ”
ERV	Mark	4	4	While he was scattering the seed , some of it fell by the road . The birds came and ate all that seed .
ERV	Mark	4	2	Jesus used stories to teach them many things . One of his lessons included this story :
ERV	Mark	4	3	“ Listen ! A farmer went out to sow seed .
ERV	Mark	4	5	Other seed fell on rocky ground , where there was not enough dirt . It grew quickly there because the soil was not deep .
ERV	Mark	4	6	But then the sun rose and the plants were burned . They died because they did not have deep roots .
ERV	Mark	4	7	Some other seed fell among thorny weeds . The weeds grew and stopped the good plants from growing . So they did not make grain .
ERV	Mark	4	8	But some of the seed fell on good ground . There it began to grow , and it made grain . Some plants made
ERV	Mark	4	30	Then Jesus said , “ What can I use to show you what God ’ s kingdom is like ? What story can I use to explain it ?
ERV	Mark	4	60	times more , and sometimes
ERV	Mark	4	100	times more. ” Use the Understanding You Have ( E )
ERV	Mark	4	9	Then Jesus said , “ You people who hear me , listen ! ” Why Jesus Used Stories to Teach ( B )
ERV	Mark	4	10	Later , Jesus was away from the people . The twelve apostles and his other followers asked him about the stories .
ERV	Mark	4	11	Jesus said , “ Only you can know the secret truth about God ’ s kingdom . But to those other people I tell everything by using stories .
ERV	Mark	4	12	I do this so that ‘ They will look and look but never really see ; they will listen and listen but never understand . If they saw and understood , they might change and be forgiven. ’ ” ( C ) Jesus Explains the Story About Seed ( D )
ERV	Mark	4	13	Then Jesus said to the followers , “ Do you understand this story ? If you don ’ t , how will you understand any story ?
ERV	Mark	4	14	The farmer is like someone who plants God ’ s teaching in people .
ERV	Mark	4	15	Sometimes the teaching falls on the path . That is like some people who hear the teaching of God . As soon as they hear it , Satan comes and takes away the teaching that was planted in them .
ERV	Mark	4	16	“ Other people are like the seed planted on rocky ground . They hear the teaching , and they quickly and gladly accept it .
ERV	Mark	4	17	But they don ’ t allow it to go deep into their lives . They keep it only a short time . As soon as trouble or persecution comes because of the teaching they accepted , they give up .
ERV	Mark	4	18	“ Others are like the seed planted among the thorny weeds . They hear the teaching ,
ERV	Mark	4	19	but their lives become full of other things : the worries of this life , the love of money , and everything else they want . This keeps the teaching from growing , and it does not produce a crop [ a ] in their lives .
ERV	Mark	4	20	“ And others are like the seed planted on the good ground . They hear the teaching and accept it . Then they grow and produce a good crop—sometimes
ERV	Mark	4	21	Then Jesus said to them , “ You don ’ t take a lamp and hide it under a bowl or a bed , do you ? Of course not . You put it on a lampstand .
ERV	Mark	4	22	Everything that is hidden will be made clear . Every secret thing will be made known .
ERV	Mark	4	23	You people who hear me , listen !
ERV	Mark	4	24	Think carefully about what you are hearing . God will know how much to give you by how much you understand now . But he will give you more than you deserve .
ERV	Mark	4	25	The people who have some understanding will receive more . But those who do not have much will lose even the small amount they have. ” Jesus Uses a Story About Seed
ERV	Mark	4	26	Then Jesus said , “ God ’ s kingdom is like a man who plants seed in the ground .
ERV	Mark	4	27	The seed begins to grow . It grows night and day . It doesn ’ t matter whether the man is sleeping or awake , the seed still grows . He doesn ’ t know how it happens .
ERV	Mark	4	28	Without any help the ground produces grain . First the plant grows , then the head , and then all the grain in the head .
ERV	Mark	4	29	When the grain is ready , the man cuts it . This is the harvest time. ” What Is God ’ s Kingdom Like ? ( F )
ERV	Mark	4	31	God ’ s kingdom is like a mustard seed , which is smaller than any other seed on earth that you can plant .
ERV	Mark	4	32	But when you plant it , it grows and becomes the largest of all the plants in your garden . It has branches that are very big . The wild birds can come and make nests there and be protected from the sun. ”
ERV	Mark	4	33	Jesus used many stories like these to teach the people . He taught them all they could understand .
ERV	Mark	4	34	He always used stories to teach them . But when he was alone with his followers , Jesus explained everything to them . Jesus ’ Followers See His Power ( G )
ERV	Mark	4	35	That day , at evening , Jesus said to his followers , “ Come with me across the lake. ”
ERV	Mark	4	36	So they left the crowd behind and went with Jesus in the boat he was already in . There were also other boats that went with them .
ERV	Mark	4	37	A very bad wind came up on the lake . The waves were coming over the sides and into the boat , and it was almost full of water .
ERV	Mark	4	38	Jesus was inside the boat , sleeping with his head on a pillow . The followers went and woke him . They said , “ Teacher , don ’ t you care about us ? We are going to drown ! ”
ERV	Mark	4	39	Jesus stood up and gave a command to the wind and the water . He said , “ Quiet ! Be still ! ” Then the wind stopped , and the lake became calm .
ERV	Mark	4	40	He said to his followers , “ Why are you afraid ? Do you still have no faith ? ”
ERV	Mark	4	41	They were very afraid and asked each other , “ What kind of man is this ? Even the wind and the water obey him ! ” Footnotes - Mark 4:19 produce a crop Meaning to do the good things God wants his people to do .
ERV	Mark	5	5	Day and night he stayed around the burial caves and on the hills . He would scream and cut himself with rocks .
ERV	Mark	5	2	When Jesus got out of the boat , a man came to him from the caves where the dead are buried . This man had an evil spirit living inside him .
ERV	Mark	5	3	He lived in the burial caves . No one could keep him tied up , even with chains .
ERV	Mark	5	4	Many times people had put chains on his hands and feet , but he broke the chains . No one was strong enough to control him .
ERV	Mark	5	6	While Jesus was still far away , the man saw him . He ran to Jesus and bowed down before him . 7-8 As Jesus was saying , “ You evil spirit , come out of this man , ” the man shouted loudly , “ What do you want with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I beg you in God ’ s name not to punish me ! ”
ERV	Mark	5	9	Then Jesus asked the man , “ What is your name ? ” The man answered , “ My name is Legion , [ b ] because there are many spirits inside me. ”
ERV	Mark	5	10	The spirits inside the man begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of that area .
ERV	Mark	5	11	A large herd of pigs was eating on a hill near there .
ERV	Mark	5	12	The evil spirits begged Jesus , “ Send us to the pigs . Let us go into them. ”
ERV	Mark	5	13	So Jesus allowed them to do this . The evil spirits left the man and went into the pigs . Then the herd of pigs ran down the hill and into the lake . They were all drowned . There were about
ERV	Mark	5	2000	pigs in that herd .
ERV	Mark	5	14	The men who had the work of caring for the pigs ran away . They ran to the town and to the farms and told everyone what happened . The people went out to see .
ERV	Mark	5	15	They came to Jesus , and they saw the man who had the many evil spirits . He was sitting down and was wearing clothes . He was in his right mind again . When they saw this , they were afraid .
ERV	Mark	5	16	Those who had seen what Jesus did told the others what happened to the man who had the demons living in him . And they also told about the pigs .
ERV	Mark	5	17	Then the people began to beg Jesus to leave their area .
ERV	Mark	5	18	Jesus was preparing to leave in the boat . The man who was now free from the demons begged to go with him .
ERV	Mark	5	19	But Jesus did not allow the man to go . He said , “ Go home to your family and friends . Tell them about all that the Lord did for you . Tell them how the Lord was good to you. ”
ERV	Mark	5	20	So the man left and told the people in the Ten Towns about the great things Jesus did for him . Everyone was amazed . Jesus Gives Life to a Dead Girl and Heals a Sick Woman ( B )
ERV	Mark	5	21	Jesus went back to the other side of the lake in the boat . There , a large crowd of people gathered around him on the shore .
ERV	Mark	5	22	A leader of the synagogue came . His name was Jairus . He saw Jesus and bowed down before him .
ERV	Mark	5	23	He begged Jesus again and again , saying , “ My little daughter is dying . Please come and lay your hands on her . Then she will be healed and will live. ”
ERV	Mark	5	24	So Jesus went with Jairus . Many people followed Jesus . They were pushing very close around him .
ERV	Mark	5	25	There among the people was a woman who had been bleeding for the past twelve years .
ERV	Mark	5	26	She had suffered very much . Many doctors had tried to help her , and all the money she had was spent , but she was not improving . In fact , her sickness was getting worse .
ERV	Mark	5	27	The woman heard about Jesus , so she followed him with the other people and touched his coat .
ERV	Mark	5	28	She thought , “ If I can just touch his clothes , that will be enough to heal me. ”
ERV	Mark	5	29	As soon as she touched his coat , her bleeding stopped . She felt that her body was healed from all the suffering .
ERV	Mark	5	30	Jesus immediately felt power go out from him , so he stopped and turned around . “ Who touched my clothes ? ” he asked .
ERV	Mark	5	31	The followers said to Jesus , “ There are so many people pushing against you . But you ask , ‘ Who touched me ? ’ ”

ERV	Mark	7	13	So you are teaching that it is not important to do what God said . You think it is more important to follow those traditions you have , which you pass on to others . And you do many things like that. ”

ERV	Mark	10	4	The Pharisees said , “ Moses allowed a man to divorce his wife by writing a certificate of divorce. ” [ a ]

ERV	Mark	10	39	.

ERV	Mark	10	41	When the other ten followers heard this , they were angry with James and John .
ERV	Mark	10	42	Jesus called all the followers together . He said , “ The non-Jewish people have men they call rulers . You know that those rulers love to show their power over the people . And their important leaders love to use all their authority over the people .
ERV	Mark	10	43	But it should not be that way with you . Whoever wants to be your leader must be your servant .
ERV	Mark	10	44	Whoever wants to be first must serve the rest of you like a slave .

ERV	Mark	11	29	Jesus answered , “ I will ask you a question . You answer my question . Then I will tell you whose authority I use to do these things .

ERV	Mark	12	22	All seven brothers married the woman and died . None of the brothers had any children with her . And she was the last to die .
ERV	Mark	12	23	But all seven brothers had married her . So at the time when people rise from death , whose wife will she be ? ”
ERV	Mark	12	24	Jesus answered , “ How could you be so wrong ? It ’ s because you don ’ t know what the Scriptures say . And you don ’ t know anything about God ’ s power .
ERV	Mark	12	25	When people rise from death , there will be no marriage . People will not be married to each other . All people will be like angels in heaven .
ERV	Mark	12	26	Surely you have read what God said about people rising from death . In the book where Moses wrote about the burning bush , [ b ] it says that God told Moses this : ‘ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob. ’ [ c ]
ERV	Mark	12	27	So they were not still dead , because he is the God only of living people . You Sadducees are so wrong ! ” Which Command Is the Most Important ? ( E )

ERV	Mark	12	30	Love the Lord your God with all your heart , all your soul , all your mind , and all your strength. ’ [ d ]
ERV	Mark	12	31	The second most important command is this : ‘ Love your neighbor [ e ] the same as you love yourself. ’ [ f ] These two commands are the most important. ”
ERV	Mark	12	32	The man answered , “ That was a good answer , Teacher . You are right in saying that God is the only Lord and that there is no other God .
ERV	Mark	12	33	And you must love God with all your heart , all your mind , and all your strength . And you must love others the same as you love yourself . These commands are more important than all the animals and sacrifices we offer to God. ”
ERV	Mark	12	34	Jesus saw that the man answered him wisely . So he said to him , “ You are close to God ’ s kingdom. ” And after that time , no one was brave enough to ask Jesus any more questions . Is the Messiah David ’ s Son or David ’ s Lord ? ( F )

ERV	Mark	12	36	With the help of the Holy Spirit , David himself says , ‘ The Lord God said to my Lord : Sit by me at my right side , and I will put your enemies under your control . [ g ] ’ ( G )

ERV	Mark	12	43	Jesus called his followers to him and said , “ This poor widow put in only two small coins . But the truth is , she gave more than all those rich people .

ERV	Mark	13	4	“ Tell us when these things will happen . And what will show us it is time for them to happen ? ”

ERV	Mark	14	49	Every day I was with you teaching in the Temple area . You did not arrest me there . But all these things have happened to show the full meaning of what the Scriptures said. ”

ERV	Mark	14	55	The leading priests and the whole high council tried to find something that Jesus had done wrong so they could kill him . But the council could find no proof that would allow them to kill Jesus .
ERV	Mark	14	56	Many people came and told lies against Jesus , but they all said different things . None of them agreed .
ERV	Mark	14	57	Then some others stood up and told more lies against Jesus . They said ,
ERV	Mark	14	58	“ We heard this man [ f ] say , ‘ I will destroy this Temple built by human hands . And three days later , I will build another Temple not made by human hands. ’ ”
ERV	Mark	14	59	But also what these people said did not agree .
ERV	Mark	14	60	Then the high priest stood up before everyone and said to Jesus , “ These people said things against you . Do you have something to say about their charges ? Are they telling the truth ? ”
ERV	Mark	14	61	But Jesus said nothing to answer him . The high priest asked Jesus another question : “ Are you the Messiah , the Son of the blessed God ? ”
ERV	Mark	14	62	Jesus answered , “ Yes , I am the Son of God . And in the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right side of God All-Powerful . And you will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven. ”
ERV	Mark	14	63	When the high priest heard this , he tore his clothes in anger . He said , “ We don ’ t need any more witnesses !
ERV	Mark	14	64	You all heard these insults to God . What do you think ? ” Everyone agreed that Jesus was guilty and must be killed .

ERV	Mark	14	69	When the servant girl saw him there , she began saying again to the people standing around , “ This man is one of them. ”
ERV	Mark	14	70	Again Peter said it was not true . A short time later , the people standing there said , “ We know you are one of them , because you are from Galilee. ”
ERV	Mark	14	71	Then Peter began to curse . He said , “ I swear to God , I don ’ t know this man you are talking about ! ”

ERV	Luke	1	20	Now , listen ! You will not be able to talk until the day when these things happen . You will lose your speech because you did not believe what I told you . But everything I said will really happen. ”
ERV	Luke	1	21	Outside , the people were still waiting for Zechariah . They were surprised that he was staying so long in the Temple .
ERV	Luke	1	22	Then Zechariah came outside , but he could not speak to them . So the people knew that he had seen a vision inside the Temple . He was not able to speak , so he could only make signs to the people .
ERV	Luke	1	23	When his time of service was finished , he went home .
ERV	Luke	1	24	Later , Zechariah ’ s wife Elizabeth became pregnant . So she did not go out of her house for five months . She said ,

ERV	Luke	1	29	But Mary was very confused about what the angel said . She wondered , “ What does this mean ? ”
ERV	Luke	1	30	The angel said to her , “ Don ’ t be afraid , Mary , because God is very pleased with you .
ERV	Luke	1	31	Listen ! You will become pregnant and have a baby boy . You will name him Jesus .

ERV	Luke	1	33	He will rule over the people of Jacob forever ; his kingdom will never end. ”
ERV	Luke	1	34	Mary said to the angel , “ How will this happen ? I am still a virgin. ”
ERV	Luke	1	35	The angel said to Mary , “ The Holy Spirit will come to you , and the power of the Most High God will cover you . The baby will be holy and will be called the Son of God .
ERV	Luke	1	36	And here ’ s something else : Your relative Elizabeth is pregnant . She is very old , but she is going to have a son . Everyone thought she could not have a baby , but she has been pregnant now for six months .
ERV	Luke	1	37	God can do anything ! ”

ERV	Luke	1	43	You are the mother of my Lord , and you have come to me ! Why has something so good happened to me ?
ERV	Luke	1	44	When I heard your voice , the baby inside me jumped with joy .
ERV	Luke	1	45	Great blessings are yours because you believed what the Lord said to you ! You believed this would happen. ” Mary Praises God
ERV	Luke	1	46	Then Mary said , “ I praise the Lord with all my heart .
ERV	Luke	1	47	I am very happy because God is my Savior .

ERV	Luke	7	34	The Son of Man came eating and drinking . And you say , ‘ Look at him ! He eats too much and drinks too much wine ! He is a friend of tax collectors and other sinners ! ’

ERV	Luke	7	39	When the Pharisee who asked Jesus to come to his house saw this , he thought to himself , “ If this man were a prophet , [ b ] he would know that the woman who is touching him is a sinner ! ”
ERV	Luke	7	40	In response , Jesus said to the Pharisee , “ Simon , I have something to say to you. ” Simon said , “ Let me hear it , Teacher. ”
ERV	Luke	7	41	Jesus said , “ There were two men . Both men owed money to the same banker . One man owed him
ERV	Luke	7	500	silver coins . The other man owed him
ERV	Luke	7	50	Jesus said to the woman , “ Because you believed , you are saved from your sins . Go in peace . ”
ERV	Luke	7	42	The men had no money , so they could not pay their debt . But the banker told the men that they did not have to pay him . Which one of those two men will love him more ? ”
ERV	Luke	7	43	Simon answered , “ I think it would be the one who owed him the most money. ” Jesus said to him , “ You are right. ”
ERV	Luke	7	44	Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon , “ Do you see this woman ? When I came into your house , you gave me no water for my feet . But she washed my feet with her tears and dried my feet with her hair .
ERV	Luke	7	45	You did not greet me with a kiss , but she has been kissing my feet since I came in .
ERV	Luke	7	46	You did not honor me with oil for my head , but she rubbed my feet with her sweet-smelling oil .
ERV	Luke	7	47	I tell you that her many sins are forgiven . This is clear , because she showed great love . People who are forgiven only a little will love only a little. ”

ERV	Luke	8	100	times more grain. ” Jesus finished the story . Then he called out , “ You people who hear me , listen ! ”

I do this so that ‘ They will look , but they will not see , and they will listen , but they will not understand. ’ ( B ) Jesus Explains the Story About Seed ( C )

ERV	Luke	8	13	Others are like the seed that fell on rock . That is like the people who hear God ’ s teaching and gladly accept it . But they don ’ t have deep roots . They believe for a while . But when trouble comes , they turn away from God .
ERV	Luke	8	14	“ What about the seed that fell among the thorny weeds ? That is like the people who hear God ’ s teaching , but they let the worries , riches , and pleasures of this life stop them from growing . So they never produce a crop . [ a ]
ERV	Luke	8	15	And what about the seed that fell on the good ground ? That is like the people who hear God ’ s teaching with a good , honest heart . They obey it and patiently produce a good crop . Use the Understanding You Have ( D )
ERV	Luke	8	16	“ No one lights a lamp and then covers it with a bowl or hides it under a bed . Instead , they put the lamp on a lampstand so that the people who come in will have enough light to see .
ERV	Luke	8	17	Everything that is hidden will become clear . Every secret thing will be made known , and everyone will see it .
ERV	Luke	8	18	So think carefully about what you are hearing . The people who have some understanding will receive more . But those who do not have understanding will lose even what they think they have. ” Jesus ’ Followers Are His True Family ( E )

ERV	Luke	9	23	Jesus continued to say to all of them , “ Any of you who want to be my follower must stop thinking about yourself and what you want . You must be willing to carry the cross that is given to you every day for following me .
ERV	Luke	9	24	Any of you who try to save the life you have will lose it . But you who give up your life for me will save it .
ERV	Luke	9	25	It is worth nothing for you to have the whole world if you yourself are destroyed or lost .
ERV	Luke	9	26	Don ’ t be ashamed of me and my teaching . If that happens , I [ a ] will be ashamed of you when I come with my divine greatness and that of the Father and the holy angels .
ERV	Luke	9	27	Believe me when I say that some of you people standing here will see God ’ s kingdom before you die. ” Jesus Is Seen With Moses and Elijah ( F )
ERV	Luke	9	28	About eight days after Jesus said these things , he took Peter , John , and James and went up on a mountain to pray .
ERV	Luke	9	29	While Jesus was praying , his face began to change . His clothes became shining white .
ERV	Luke	9	30	Then two men were there , talking with him . They were Moses and Elijah .
ERV	Luke	9	31	They also looked bright and glorious . They were talking with Jesus about his death that would happen in Jerusalem .
ERV	Luke	9	32	Peter and the others were asleep . But they woke up and saw the glory of Jesus . They also saw the two men who were standing with him .
ERV	Luke	9	33	When Moses and Elijah were leaving , Peter said , “ Master , it is good that we are here . We will put three tents here—one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah. ” ( He did not know what he was saying . )
ERV	Luke	9	34	While Peter was saying these things , a cloud came all around them . Peter , John , and James were afraid when the cloud covered them .
ERV	Luke	9	35	A voice came from the cloud and said , “ This is my Son . He is the one I have chosen . Obey him. ”

ERV	Luke	9	38	A man in the group shouted to him , “ Teacher , please come and look at my son . He is the only child I have .
ERV	Luke	9	39	An evil spirit comes into him , and then he shouts . He loses control of himself and foams at the mouth . The evil spirit continues to hurt him and almost never leaves him .
ERV	Luke	9	40	I begged your followers to make the evil spirit leave my son , but they could not do it. ”
ERV	Luke	9	41	Jesus answered , “ You people today have no faith . Your lives are all wrong . How long must I be with you and be patient with you ? ” Then Jesus said to the man , “ Bring your son here. ”
ERV	Luke	9	42	While the boy was coming , the demon threw the boy to the ground . The boy lost control of himself . But Jesus gave a strong command to the evil spirit . Then the boy was healed , and Jesus gave him back to his father .
ERV	Luke	9	43	All the people were amazed at the great power of God . Jesus Talks About His Death ( H ) The people were still amazed about all the things Jesus did . He said to his followers ,
ERV	Luke	9	44	“ Don ’ t forget what I will tell you now : The Son of Man will soon be handed over to the control of other men. ”
ERV	Luke	9	45	But the followers did not understand what he meant . The meaning was hidden from them so that they could not understand it . But they were afraid to ask Jesus about what he said . Who Is the Greatest ? ( I )
ERV	Luke	9	46	Jesus ’ followers began to have an argument about which one of them was the greatest .
ERV	Luke	9	47	Jesus knew what they were thinking , so he took a little child and stood the child beside him .
ERV	Luke	9	48	Then he said to the followers , “ Whoever accepts a little child like this in my name is accepting me . And anyone who accepts me is also accepting the one who sent me . The one among you who is the most humble—this is the one who is great. ” Whoever Is Not Against You Is for You ( J )
ERV	Luke	9	49	John answered , “ Master , we saw someone using your name to force demons out of people . We told him to stop because he does not belong to our group. ”
ERV	Luke	9	51	The time was coming near when Jesus would leave and go back to heaven . He decided to go to Jerusalem .
ERV	Luke	9	52	He sent some men ahead of him . They went into a town in Samaria to make everything ready for him .
ERV	Luke	9	53	But the people there would not welcome Jesus because he was going toward Jerusalem .
ERV	Luke	9	54	James and John , the followers of Jesus , saw this . They said , “ Lord , do you want us to call fire down from heaven and destroy those people ? ” [ b ]
ERV	Luke	9	55	But Jesus turned and criticized them for saying this . [ c ]
ERV	Luke	9	56	Then he and his followers went to another town . Following Jesus ( K )
ERV	Luke	9	57	They were all traveling along the road . Someone said to Jesus , “ I will follow you anywhere you go. ”
ERV	Luke	9	58	He answered , “ The foxes have holes to live in . The birds have nests . But the Son of Man has no place where he can rest his head. ”
ERV	Luke	9	59	Jesus said to another man , “ Follow me ! ” But the man said , “ Lord , let me go and bury my father first. ”
ERV	Luke	9	60	But Jesus said to him , “ Let the people who are dead bury their own dead . You must go and tell about God ’ s kingdom. ”
ERV	Luke	9	61	Another man said , “ I will follow you , Lord , but first let me go and say goodbye to my family. ”
ERV	Luke	9	62	Jesus said , “ Anyone who begins to plow a field but looks back is not prepared for God ’ s kingdom . ”
ERV	Luke	10	10	“ But if you go into a town and the people don ’ t welcome you , then go out into the streets of that town and say ,
ERV	Luke	10	72	Some Greek copies say
ERV	Luke	10	2	He said to them , “ There is such a big harvest of people to bring in . But there are only a few workers to help harvest them . God owns the harvest . Ask him to send more workers to help bring in his harvest .
ERV	Luke	10	3	“ You can go now . But listen ! I am sending you , and you will be like sheep among wolves .
ERV	Luke	10	4	Don ’ t carry any money , a bag , or sandals . Don ’ t stop to talk with people on the road .
ERV	Luke	10	5	Before you go into a house , say , ‘ Peace be with this home. ’
ERV	Luke	10	6	If the people living there love peace , your blessing of peace will stay with them . But if not , your blessing of peace will come back to you .
ERV	Luke	10	7	Stay in the peace-loving house . Eat and drink what the people there give you . A worker should be given his pay . Don ’ t leave that house to stay in another house .
ERV	Luke	10	8	“ If you go into a town and the people welcome you , eat the food they give you .
ERV	Luke	10	9	Heal the sick people who live there , and tell them , ‘ God ’ s kingdom is now very near you [ b ] ! ’
ERV	Luke	10	11	‘ Even the dirt from your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you . But remember that God ’ s kingdom is coming soon. ’
ERV	Luke	10	12	I tell you , on the judgment day it will be worse for the people of that town than for the people of Sodom . Jesus Warns People Who Refuse to Believe ( A )
ERV	Luke	10	13	“ It will be bad for you , Chorazin ! It will be bad for you , Bethsaida ! I did many miracles in you . If those same miracles had happened in Tyre and Sidon , then the people in those cities would have changed their lives and stopped sinning a long time ago . They would have worn sackcloth and sat in ashes to show that they were sorry for their sins .
ERV	Luke	10	14	But on the judgment day it will be worse for you than for Tyre and Sidon .
ERV	Luke	10	15	And you , Capernaum , will you be lifted up to heaven ? No , you will be thrown down to the place of death !
ERV	Luke	10	16	“ When anyone listens to you my followers , they are really listening to me . But when anyone refuses to accept you , they are really refusing to accept me . And when anyone refuses to accept me , they are refusing to accept the one who sent me. ” Satan Falls

ERV	Luke	10	18	Jesus said to them , “ I saw Satan falling like lightning from the sky .
ERV	Luke	10	19	He is the enemy , but know that I have given you more power than he has . I have given you power to crush his snakes and scorpions under your feet . Nothing will hurt you .
ERV	Luke	10	20	Yes , even the spirits obey you . And you can be happy , not because you have this power , but because your names are written in heaven. ” Jesus Prays to the Father ( B )
ERV	Luke	10	21	Then the Holy Spirit made Jesus feel very happy . Jesus said , “ I praise you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth . I am thankful that you have hidden these things from those who are so wise and so smart . But you have shown them to people who are like little children . Yes , Father , you did this because it ’ s what you really wanted to do .
ERV	Luke	10	22	“ My Father has given me all things . No one knows who the Son is—only the Father knows . And only the Son knows who the Father is . The only people who will know about the Father are those the Son chooses to tell. ”
ERV	Luke	10	23	Then Jesus turned to his followers . They were there alone with him . He said , “ It is a great blessing for you to see what you now see !
ERV	Luke	10	24	I tell you , many prophets and kings wanted to see what you now see , but they could not . And they wanted to hear what you now hear , but they could not. ” A Story About the Good Samaritan
ERV	Luke	10	25	Then an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus . He said , “ Teacher , what must I do to get eternal life ? ”
ERV	Luke	10	26	Jesus said to him , “ What is written in the law ? What do you understand from it ? ”
ERV	Luke	10	27	The man answered , “ ‘ Love the Lord your God with all your heart , all your soul , all your strength , and all your mind. ’ [ c ] Also , ‘ Love your neighbor the same as you love yourself. ’ [ d ] ”
ERV	Luke	10	28	Jesus said , “ Your answer is right . Do this and you will have eternal life. ”
ERV	Luke	10	29	But the man wanted to show that the way he was living was right . So he said to Jesus , “ But who is my neighbor ? ”
ERV	Luke	10	30	To answer this question , Jesus said , “ A man was going down the road from Jerusalem to Jericho . Some robbers surrounded him , tore off his clothes , and beat him . Then they left him lying there on the ground almost dead .
ERV	Luke	10	31	“ It happened that a Jewish priest was going down that road . When he saw the man , he did not stop to help him . He walked away .
ERV	Luke	10	32	Next , a Levite came near . He saw the hurt man , but he went around him . He would not stop to help him either . He just walked away .
ERV	Luke	10	33	“ Then a Samaritan man traveled down that road . He came to the place where the hurt man was lying . He saw the man and felt very sorry for him .
ERV	Luke	10	34	The Samaritan went to him and poured olive oil and wine [ e ] on his wounds . Then he covered the man ’ s wounds with cloth . The Samaritan had a donkey . He put the hurt man on his donkey , and he took him to an inn . There he cared for him .
ERV	Luke	10	35	The next day , the Samaritan took out two silver coins and gave them to the man who worked at the inn . He said , ‘ Take care of this hurt man . If you spend more money on him , I will pay it back to you when I come again. ’ ”
ERV	Luke	10	36	Then Jesus said , “ Which one of these three men do you think was really a neighbor to the man who was hurt by the robbers ? ”
ERV	Luke	10	37	The teacher of the law answered , “ The one who helped him. ” Jesus said , “ Then you go and do the same. ” Mary and Martha
ERV	Luke	10	38	While Jesus and his followers were traveling , he went into a town , and a woman named Martha let him stay at her house .
ERV	Luke	10	39	She had a sister named Mary . Mary was sitting at Jesus ’ feet and listening to him teach .
ERV	Luke	10	40	But her sister Martha was busy doing all the work that had to be done . Martha went in and said , “ Lord , don ’ t you care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself ? Tell her to help me ! ”
ERV	Luke	10	41	But the Lord answered her , “ Martha , Martha , you are getting worried and upset about too many things .
ERV	Luke	10	42	Only one thing is important . Mary has made the right choice , and it will never be taken away from her. ” Footnotes - Luke 10:1

ERV	Luke	11	4	Forgive our sins , just as we forgive everyone who has done wrong to us . And don ’ t let us be tempted. ’ ” Ask God for What You Need ( B ) 5-6 Then Jesus said to them , “ Suppose one of you went to your friend ’ s house very late at night and said to him , ‘ A friend of mine has come into town to visit me . But I have nothing for him to eat . Please give me three loaves of bread. ’
ERV	Luke	11	7	Your friend inside the house answers , ‘ Go away ! Don ’ t bother me ! The door is already locked . My children and I are in bed . I can not get up and give you the bread now. ’
ERV	Luke	11	8	I tell you , maybe friendship is not enough to make him get up to give you the bread . But he will surely get up to give you what you need if you continue to ask .
ERV	Luke	11	9	So I tell you , continue to ask , and God will give to you . Continue to search , and you will find . Continue to knock , and the door will open for you .
ERV	Luke	11	10	Yes , whoever continues to ask will receive . Whoever continues to look will find . And whoever continues to knock will have the door opened for them .
ERV	Luke	11	12	Or , if he asked for an egg , would you give him a scorpion ? Of course not !
ERV	Luke	11	13	Even you who are bad know how to give good things to your children . So surely your heavenly Father knows how to give the Holy Spirit to the people who ask him. ” Jesus ’ Power Is From God ( C )
ERV	Luke	11	14	One time Jesus was sending a demon out of a man who could not talk . When the demon came out , the man was able to speak . The crowds were amazed .
ERV	Luke	11	15	But some of the people said , “ He uses the power of Satan [ a ] to force demons out of people . Satan is the ruler of demons. ”
ERV	Luke	11	16	Some others there wanted to test Jesus . They asked him to do a miracle as a sign from God .
ERV	Luke	11	17	But he knew what they were thinking . So he said to them , “ Every kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed . And a family that fights against itself will break apart .

ERV	Luke	11	20	But I use the power of God to force out demons . This shows that God ’ s kingdom has now come to you .
ERV	Luke	11	21	“ When a strong man with many weapons guards his own house , the things in his house are safe .
ERV	Luke	11	22	But suppose a stronger man comes and defeats him . The stronger man will take away the weapons that the first man trusted to keep his house safe . Then the stronger man will do what he wants with the other man ’ s things .
ERV	Luke	11	23	“ Whoever is not with me is against me . And anyone who does not work with me is working against me . The Danger of Emptiness ( D )
ERV	Luke	11	24	“ When an evil spirit comes out of someone , it travels through dry places , looking for a place to rest . But it finds no place to rest . So it says , ‘ I will go back to the home I left. ’
ERV	Luke	11	25	When it comes back , it finds that home all neat and clean .
ERV	Luke	11	26	Then the evil spirit goes out and brings back seven other spirits more evil than itself . They all go and live there , and that person has even more trouble than before. ” The People God Blesses
ERV	Luke	11	27	As Jesus was saying these things , a woman with the people there called out to him , “ Blessings from God belong to the woman who gave birth to you and fed you ! ”
ERV	Luke	11	28	But Jesus said , “ The people who hear the teaching of God and obey it—they are the ones who have God ’ s blessing. ” Some People Doubt Jesus ’ Authority ( E )
ERV	Luke	11	29	The crowd grew larger and larger . Jesus said , “ The people who live today are evil . They ask for a miracle as a sign from God . But no miracle will be done to prove anything to them . The only sign will be the miracle that happened to Jonah . [ b ]
ERV	Luke	11	30	Jonah was a sign for those who lived in Nineveh . [ c ] It is the same with the Son of Man . He will be a sign for the people of this time .
ERV	Luke	11	31	“ On the judgment day , you people who live now will be compared with the queen of the South , [ d ] and she will be a witness who shows how guilty you are . Why do I say this ? Because she traveled from far , far away to listen to Solomon ’ s wise teaching . And I tell you that someone [ e ] greater than Solomon is right here , but you won ’ t listen !
ERV	Luke	11	32	. - Luke 11:34 Literally , “ The lamp of the body is your eye . When your eye is pure , your whole body is full of light . But if it is evil , your body is dark. ” - Luke 11:38 wash his hands Washing the hands was a Jewish religious custom that the Pharisees thought was very important . - Luke 11:42 You give … garden Literally , “ You tithe mint , rue , and every herb. ” The Law of Moses required Israelites to share their food supply by dedicating a tenth of their field crops and livestock to God ( see Lev . 27:30-32 ; Deut . 26:12 ) . This did not include such small garden plants as those mentioned here . So these Pharisees were giving more than required to be sure they were not breaking the Law . - Luke 11:46 You make … obey Literally , “ You put heavy burdens on people that are hard for them to carry. ” - Luke 11:49 prophets and apostles People chosen by God to tell his Good News to the world . - Luke 11:51 Abel In the Hebrew Old Testament , the first person to be murdered . - Luke 11:51 Zechariah In the Hebrew Old Testament , the last person to be murdered .
ERV	Luke	11	33	“ No one takes a light and puts it under a bowl or hides it . Instead , they put it on a lampstand so that the people who come in can see .
ERV	Luke	11	34	The only source of light for the body is the eye . When you look at people and want to help them , you are full of light . But when you look at people in a selfish way , you are full of darkness . [ f ]
ERV	Luke	11	35	So be careful ! Don ’ t let the light in you become darkness .
ERV	Luke	11	36	If you are full of light , and there is no part of you that is dark , then you will be all bright , as though you have the light of a lamp shining on you. ” Jesus Criticizes the Religious Leaders ( G )
ERV	Luke	11	37	After Jesus had finished speaking , a Pharisee asked Jesus to eat with him . So he went and took a place at the table .
ERV	Luke	11	38	But the Pharisee was surprised when he saw that Jesus did not wash his hands [ g ] first before the meal .
ERV	Luke	11	39	The Lord said to him , “ The washing you Pharisees do is like cleaning only the outside of a cup or a dish . But what is inside you ? You want only to cheat and hurt people .
ERV	Luke	11	40	You are foolish ! The same one who made what is outside also made what is inside .
ERV	Luke	11	41	So pay attention to what is inside . Give to the people who need help . Then you will be fully clean .
ERV	Luke	11	42	“ But it will be bad for you Pharisees ! You give God a tenth of the food you get , even your mint , your rue , and every other little plant in your garden . [ h ] But you forget to be fair to others and to love God . These are the things you should do . And you should also continue to do those other things .
ERV	Luke	11	43	“ It will be bad for you Pharisees because you love to have the most important seats in the synagogues . And you love for people to show respect to you in the marketplaces .
ERV	Luke	11	44	It will be bad for you , because you are like hidden graves . People walk on them without knowing it. ”
ERV	Luke	11	45	One of the experts in the law said to Jesus , “ Teacher , when you say these things about the Pharisees , you are criticizing our group too. ”
ERV	Luke	11	46	Jesus answered , “ It will be bad for you , you experts in the law ! You make strict rules that are very hard for people to obey . [ i ] You try to force others to obey your rules . But you yourselves don ’ t even try to follow any of those rules .
ERV	Luke	11	47	It will be bad for you , because you build tombs for the prophets . But these are the same prophets your ancestors killed !
ERV	Luke	11	48	And now you show all people that you agree with what your ancestors did . They killed the prophets , and you build tombs for the prophets !
ERV	Luke	11	49	This is why God in his wisdom said , ‘ I will send prophets and apostles [ j ] to them . Some of my prophets and apostles will be killed by evil men . Others will be treated badly. ’
ERV	Luke	11	50	“ So you people who live now will be punished for the deaths of all the prophets who were killed since the beginning of the world .
ERV	Luke	11	51	You will be punished for the killing of Abel . [ k ] And you will be punished for the killing of Zechariah , [ l ] who was killed between the altar and the Temple . Yes , I tell you that you people will be punished for them all .
ERV	Luke	11	52	“ It will be bad for you , you experts in the law ! You have taken away the key to learning about God . You yourselves would not learn , and you stopped others from learning too. ”
ERV	Luke	11	53	When Jesus went out , the teachers of the law and the Pharisees began to give him much trouble . They tried to make him answer questions about many things .
ERV	Luke	11	54	They were trying to find a way to catch Jesus saying something wrong . Footnotes - Luke 11:15 Satan Literally , “ Beelzebul ” ( the devil ) . Also in verses

ERV	Luke	12	4	Then Jesus said to the people , “ I tell you , my friends , don ’ t be afraid of people . They can kill the body , but after that they can do nothing more to hurt you .
ERV	Luke	12	5	I will show you the one to fear . You should fear God , who has the power to kill you and also to throw you into hell . Yes , he is the one you should fear .

ERV	Luke	12	11	“ When men bring you into the synagogues before the leaders and other important men , don ’ t worry about what you will say .
ERV	Luke	12	13	One of the men in the crowd said to Jesus , “ Teacher , our father just died and left some things for us . Tell my brother to share them with me. ”
ERV	Luke	12	14	But Jesus said to him , “ Who said I should be your judge or decide how to divide your father ’ s things between you two ? ”
ERV	Luke	12	15	Then Jesus said to them , “ Be careful and guard against all kinds of greed . People do not get life from the many things they own. ”
ERV	Luke	12	16	Then Jesus used this story : “ There was a rich man who had some land . His land grew a very good crop of food .
ERV	Luke	12	17	He thought to himself , ‘ What will I do ? I have no place to keep all my crops. ’
ERV	Luke	12	18	“ Then he said , ‘ I know what I will do . I will tear down my barns and build bigger barns ! I will put all my wheat and good things together in my new barns .
ERV	Luke	12	19	Then I can say to myself , I have many good things stored . I have saved enough for many years . Rest , eat , drink , and enjoy life ! ’
ERV	Luke	12	20	“ But God said to that man , ‘ Foolish man ! Tonight you will die . So what about the things you prepared for yourself ? Who will get those things now ? ’
ERV	Luke	12	21	“ This is how it will be for anyone who saves things only for himself . To God that person is not rich. ” Put God ’ s Kingdom First ( C )
ERV	Luke	12	22	Jesus said to his followers , “ So I tell you , don ’ t worry about the things you need to live—what you will eat or what you will wear .
ERV	Luke	12	23	Life is more important than food , and the body is more important than what you put on it .
ERV	Luke	12	24	Look at the birds . They don ’ t plant , harvest , or save food in houses or barns , but God feeds them . And you are worth much more than crows .
ERV	Luke	12	25	None of you can add any time to your life by worrying about it .
ERV	Luke	12	26	And if you can ’ t do the little things , why worry about the big things ?
ERV	Luke	12	27	“ Think about how the wildflowers grow . They don ’ t work or make clothes for themselves . But I tell you that even Solomon , the great and rich king , was not dressed as beautifully as one of these flowers .
ERV	Luke	12	28	If God makes what grows in the field so beautiful , what do you think he will do for you ? That ’ s just grass—one day it ’ s alive , and the next day someone throws it into a fire . But God cares enough to make it beautiful . Surely he will do much more for you . Your faith is so small !
ERV	Luke	12	29	“ So don ’ t always think about what you will eat or what you will drink . Don ’ t worry about it .
ERV	Luke	12	30	That ’ s what all those people who don ’ t know God are always thinking about . But your Father knows that you need these things .

ERV	Luke	12	35	“ Be ready ! Be fully dressed and have your lights shining .
ERV	Luke	12	36	Be like servants who are waiting for their master to come home from a wedding party . The master comes and knocks , and the servants immediately open the door for him .
ERV	Luke	12	37	When their master sees that they are ready and waiting for him , it will be a great day for those servants . I can tell you without a doubt , the master will get himself ready to serve a meal and tell the servants to sit down . Then he will serve them .
ERV	Luke	12	38	Those servants might have to wait until midnight or later for their master . But they will be glad they did when he comes in and finds them still waiting .
ERV	Luke	12	39	“ What would a homeowner do if he knew when a thief was coming ? You know he would not let the thief break in .
ERV	Luke	12	40	So you also must be ready , because the Son of Man will come at a time when you don ’ t expect him ! ” Who Is the Trusted Servant ? ( E )
ERV	Luke	12	41	Peter said , “ Lord , did you tell this story for us or for all people ? ”
ERV	Luke	12	42	The Lord said , “ Who is the wise and trusted servant ? The master trusts one servant to give the other servants their food at the right time . Who is the servant that the master trusts to do that work ?
ERV	Luke	12	43	When the master comes and finds him doing the work he gave him , it will be a day of blessing for that servant !
ERV	Luke	12	44	I can tell you without a doubt , the master will choose that servant to take care of everything he owns .
ERV	Luke	12	45	“ But what will happen if that servant is evil and thinks his master will not come back soon ? He will begin to beat the other servants , men and women . He will eat and drink until he has had too much .
ERV	Luke	12	46	Then the master will come when the servant is not ready , at a time when the servant is not expecting him . Then the master will punish that servant and send him away to be with the other people who don ’ t obey .
ERV	Luke	12	47	“ That servant knew what his master wanted him to do . But he did not make himself ready or try to do what his master wanted . So that servant will be punished very much !
ERV	Luke	12	48	But what about the servant who does not know what his master wants ? He also does things that deserve punishment . But he will get less punishment than the servant who knew what he should do . Whoever has been given much will be responsible for much . Much more will be expected from the one who has been given more. ” Following Jesus May Bring You Trouble ( F )
ERV	Luke	12	49	Jesus continued speaking : “ I came to bring fire to the world . I wish it were already burning !

ERV	Luke	12	54	Then Jesus said to the people , “ When you see clouds growing bigger in the west , you say , ‘ A rainstorm is coming. ’ And soon it begins to rain .
ERV	Luke	12	55	When you feel the wind begin to blow from the south , you say , ‘ It will be a hot day. ’ And you are right .
ERV	Luke	12	56	You hypocrites ! You can understand the weather . Why don ’ t you understand what is happening now ? Settle Your Problems ( H )
ERV	Luke	12	57	“ Why can ’ t you decide for yourselves what is right ?
ERV	Luke	12	58	Suppose someone is suing you , and you are both going to court . Try hard to settle it on the way . If you don ’ t settle it , you may have to go before the judge . And the judge will hand you over to the officer , who will throw you into jail .

ERV	Luke	13	5	They were not . But I tell you if you don ’ t decide now to change your lives , you will all be destroyed too ! ” The Useless Tree
ERV	Luke	13	6	Jesus told this story : “ A man had a fig tree . He planted it in his garden . He came looking for some fruit on it , but he found none .
ERV	Luke	13	7	He had a servant who took care of his garden . So he said to his servant , ‘ I have been looking for fruit on this tree for three years , but I never find any . Cut it down ! Why should it waste the ground ? ’
ERV	Luke	13	8	But the servant answered , ‘ Master , let the tree have one more year to produce fruit . Let me dig up the dirt around it and fertilize it .
ERV	Luke	13	9	Maybe the tree will have fruit on it next year . If it still does not produce , then you can cut it down. ’ ” Jesus Heals a Woman on the Sabbath

ERV	Luke	13	19	God ’ s kingdom is like the seed of the mustard plant . Someone plants this seed in their garden . The seed grows and becomes a tree , and the birds build nests on its branches. ”
ERV	Luke	13	20	Jesus said again , “ What can I compare God ’ s kingdom with ?
ERV	Luke	13	21	It is like yeast that a woman mixes into a big bowl of flour to make bread . The yeast makes all the dough rise. ” The Narrow Door ( B )
ERV	Luke	13	22	Jesus was teaching in every town and village . He continued to travel toward Jerusalem .
ERV	Luke	13	23	Someone said to him , “ Lord , how many people will be saved ? Only a few ? ” Jesus said ,
ERV	Luke	13	24	“ The door to heaven is narrow . Try hard to enter it . Many people will want to enter there , but they will not be able to go in .
ERV	Luke	13	25	If a man locks the door of his house , you can stand outside and knock on the door , but he won ’ t open it . You can say , ‘ Sir , open the door for us. ’ But he will answer , ‘ I don ’ t know you . Where did you come from ? ’
ERV	Luke	13	26	Then you will say , ‘ We ate and drank with you . You taught in the streets of our town. ’
ERV	Luke	13	27	Then he will say to you , ‘ I don ’ t know you . Where did you come from ? Get away from me ! You are all people who do wrong ! ’

ERV	Luke	13	31	Just then some Pharisees came to Jesus and said , “ Go away from here and hide . Herod wants to kill you ! ”
ERV	Luke	13	32	Jesus said to them , “ Go tell that fox , [ b ] ‘ Today and tomorrow I am forcing demons out of people and finishing my work of healing . Then , the next day , the work will be finished. ’
ERV	Luke	13	33	After that I must go , because all prophets should die in Jerusalem .

ERV	Luke	14	2	A man with a bad disease [ a ] was there in front of him .
ERV	Luke	14	3	Jesus said to the Pharisees and experts in the law , “ Is it right or wrong to heal on the Sabbath day ? ”
ERV	Luke	14	4	But they would not answer his question . So he took the man and healed him . Then he sent the man away .
ERV	Luke	14	5	Jesus said to the Pharisees and teachers of the law , “ If your son or work animal falls into a well on the Sabbath day , you know you would pull him out immediately. ”
ERV	Luke	14	6	The Pharisees and teachers of the law could say nothing against what he said . Don ’ t Make Yourself Important
ERV	Luke	14	7	Then Jesus noticed that some of the guests were choosing the best places to sit . So he told this story :
ERV	Luke	14	8	“ When someone invites you to a wedding , don ’ t sit in the most important seat . They may have invited someone more important than you .
ERV	Luke	14	9	And if you are sitting in the most important seat , they will come to you and say , ‘ Give this man your seat ! ’ Then you will have to move down to the last place and be embarrassed .
ERV	Luke	14	10	“ So when someone invites you , go sit in the seat that is not important . Then they will come to you and say , ‘ Friend , move up here to this better place ! ’ What an honor this will be for you in front of all the other guests .
ERV	Luke	14	11	Everyone who makes themselves important will be made humble . But everyone who makes themselves humble will be made important. ” You Will Be Rewarded
ERV	Luke	14	12	Then Jesus said to the Pharisee who had invited him , “ When you give a lunch or a dinner , don ’ t invite only your friends , brothers , relatives , and rich neighbors . At another time they will pay you back by inviting you to eat with them .
ERV	Luke	14	13	Instead , when you give a feast , invite the poor , the crippled , and the blind .
ERV	Luke	14	15	One of the men sitting at the table with Jesus heard these things . The man said to him , “ It will be a great blessing for anyone to eat a meal in God ’ s kingdom ! ”
ERV	Luke	14	16	Jesus said to him , “ A man gave a big dinner . He invited many people .
ERV	Luke	14	17	When it was time to eat , he sent his servant to tell the guests , ‘ Come . The food is ready. ’
ERV	Luke	14	18	But all the guests said they could not come . Each one made an excuse . The first one said , ‘ I have just bought a field , so I must go look at it . Please excuse me. ’
ERV	Luke	14	19	Another man said , ‘ I have just bought five pairs of work animals ; I must go and try them out . Please excuse me. ’
ERV	Luke	14	20	A third man said , ‘ I just got married ; I can ’ t come. ’
ERV	Luke	14	21	“ So the servant returned and told his master what happened . The master was angry . He said , ‘ Hurry ! Go into the streets and alleys of the town . Bring me the poor , the crippled , the blind , and the lame. ’
ERV	Luke	14	22	“ Later , the servant said to him , ‘ Master , I did what you told me to do , but we still have places for more people. ’
ERV	Luke	14	23	The master said to the servant , ‘ Go out to the highways and country roads . Tell the people there to come . I want my house to be full !
ERV	Luke	14	24	I tell you , not one of those people I invited first will eat any of this food I prepared. ’ ” Decide if You Can Follow Me ( B )
ERV	Luke	14	25	Many people were traveling with Jesus . He said to them ,
ERV	Luke	14	26	“ If you come to me but will not leave your family , you can not be my follower . You must love me more than your father , mother , wife , children , brothers , and sisters—even more than your own life !
ERV	Luke	14	27	Whoever will not carry the cross that is given to them when they follow me can not be my follower .
ERV	Luke	14	28	“ If you wanted to build a building , you would first sit down and decide how much it would cost . You must see if you have enough money to finish the job .
ERV	Luke	14	29	If you don ’ t do that , you might begin the work , but you would not be able to finish . And if you could not finish it , everyone would laugh at you .
ERV	Luke	14	30	They would say , ‘ This man began to build , but he was not able to finish. ’
ERV	Luke	14	31	“ If a king is going to fight against another king , first he will sit down and plan . If he has only 10,000 men , he will try to decide if he is able to defeat the other king who has 20,000 men .
ERV	Luke	14	32	If he thinks he can not defeat the other king , he will send some men to ask for peace while that king ’ s army is still far away .
ERV	Luke	14	33	“ It is the same for each of you . You must leave everything you have to follow me . If not , you can not be my follower . Don ’ t Lose Your Influence ( C )
ERV	Luke	14	34	“ Salt is a good thing . But if the salt loses its salty taste , you can ’ t make it salty again .
ERV	Luke	14	35	It is worth nothing . You can ’ t even use it as dirt or dung . People just throw it away . “ You people who hear me , listen ! ” Footnotes - Luke 14:2 disease The man had dropsy , a sickness that causes the body to swell larger and larger .
ERV	Luke	15	15	So he went and got a job with one of the people who lived there . The man sent him into the fields to feed pigs .
ERV	Luke	15	2	Then the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to complain , “ Look , this man [ a ] welcomes sinners and even eats with them ! ”
ERV	Luke	15	3	Then Jesus told them this story :
ERV	Luke	15	4	“ Suppose one of you has
ERV	Luke	15	100	sheep , but one of them gets lost . What will you do ? You will leave the other
ERV	Luke	15	99	good people who don ’ t need to change .
ERV	Luke	15	5	And when you find it , you will be very happy . You will carry it
ERV	Luke	15	6	home , go to your friends and neighbors and say to them , ‘ Be happy with me because I found my lost sheep ! ’
ERV	Luke	15	7	In the same way , I tell you , heaven is a happy place when one sinner decides to change . There is more joy for that one sinner than for
ERV	Luke	15	8	“ Suppose a woman has ten silver coins , [ b ] but she loses one of them . She will take a light and clean the house . She will look carefully for the coin until she finds it .

ERV	Luke	15	10	In the same way , it ’ s a happy time for the angels of God when one sinner decides to change. ” Story About Two Sons
ERV	Luke	15	11	Then Jesus said , “ There was a man who had two sons .
ERV	Luke	15	12	The younger son said to his father , ‘ Give me now the part of your property that I am supposed to receive someday. ’ So the father divided his wealth between his two sons .
ERV	Luke	15	13	“ A few days later the younger son gathered up all that he had and left . He traveled far away to another country , and there he wasted his money living like a fool .
ERV	Luke	15	14	After he spent everything he had , there was a terrible famine throughout the country . He was hungry and needed money .
ERV	Luke	15	16	He was so hungry that he wanted to eat the food the pigs were eating . But no one gave him anything .
ERV	Luke	15	17	“ The son realized that he had been very foolish . He thought , ‘ All my father ’ s hired workers have plenty of food . But here I am , almost dead because I have nothing to eat .
ERV	Luke	15	18	I will leave and go to my father . I will say to him : Father , I have sinned against God and have done wrong to you .
ERV	Luke	15	19	I am no longer worthy to be called your son . But let me be like one of your hired workers. ’
ERV	Luke	15	20	So he left and went to his father . The Younger Son Returns “ While the son was still a long way off , his father saw him coming and felt sorry for him . So he ran to him and hugged and kissed him .
ERV	Luke	15	21	The son said , ‘ Father , I have sinned against God and have done wrong to you . I am no longer worthy to be called your son. ’
ERV	Luke	15	22	“ But the father said to his servants , ‘ Hurry ! Bring the best clothes and put them on him . Also , put a ring on his finger and good sandals on his feet .

ERV	Luke	15	25	“ The older son had been out in the field . When he came near the house , he heard the sound of music and dancing .
ERV	Luke	15	26	So he called to one of the servant boys and asked , ‘ What does all this mean ? ’
ERV	Luke	15	27	The boy said , ‘ Your brother has come back , and your father killed the best calf to eat . He is happy because he has his son back safe and sound. ’
ERV	Luke	15	28	“ The older son was angry and would not go in to the party . So his father went out and begged him to come in .
ERV	Luke	15	29	But he said to his father , ‘ Look , for all these years I have worked like a slave for you . I have always done what you told me to do , and you never gave me even a young goat for a party with my friends .
ERV	Luke	15	30	But then this son of yours comes home after wasting your money on prostitutes , and you kill the best calf for him ! ’
ERV	Luke	15	31	“ His father said to him , ‘ Oh , my son , you are always with me , and everything I have is yours .
ERV	Luke	15	32	But this was a day to be happy and celebrate . Your brother was dead , but now he is alive . He was lost , but now he is found . ’ ”
ERV	Luke	16	16	“ Before John the Baptizer came , people were taught the Law of Moses and the writings of the prophets . But since the time of John , the Good News about God ’ s kingdom is being told . And everyone is trying hard to get into it .
ERV	Luke	16	2	So he called the manager in and said to him , ‘ I have heard bad things about you . Give me a report of what you have done with my money . You can ’ t be my manager anymore. ’
ERV	Luke	16	3	“ So , the manager thought to himself , ‘ What will I do ? My master is taking my job away from me . I am not strong enough to dig ditches . I am too proud to beg .
ERV	Luke	16	4	I know what I will do ! I will do something to make friends , so that when I lose my job , they will welcome me into their homes. ’
ERV	Luke	16	5	“ So the manager called in each person who owed the master some money . He asked the first one , ‘ How much do you owe my master ? ’
ERV	Luke	16	6	He answered , ‘ I owe him
ERV	Luke	16	100	measures [ b ] of wheat. ’ Then the manager said to him , ‘ Here is your bill ; you can make it less . Write
ERV	Luke	16	50	jars. ’
ERV	Luke	16	7	“ Then the manager asked another one , ‘ How much do you owe my master ? ’ He answered , ‘ I owe him
ERV	Luke	16	80	measures. ’
ERV	Luke	16	8	“ Later , the master told the dishonest manager that he had done a smart thing . Yes , worldly people are smarter in their business with each other than spiritual people are .
ERV	Luke	16	9	“ I tell you , use the worldly things you have now to make ‘ friends ’ for later . Then , when those things are gone , you will be welcomed into a home that lasts forever .

ERV	Luke	16	14	The Pharisees were listening to all these things . They criticized Jesus because they all loved money .

ERV	Luke	17	22	Then Jesus said to his followers , “ The time will come when you will want very much to see one of the days of the Son of Man , but you will not be able to .
ERV	Luke	17	23	People will say to you , ‘ Look , there it is ! ’ or ‘ Look , here it is ! ’ Stay where you are ; don ’ t go away and search .
ERV	Luke	17	24	“ When the Son of Man comes again , you will know it . On that day he will shine like lightning flashes across the sky .
ERV	Luke	17	25	But first , the Son of Man must suffer many things . The people of today will refuse to accept him .
ERV	Luke	17	26	. - Luke 17:36 A few Greek copies add verse
ERV	Luke	17	27	People were eating , drinking , and getting married even on the day when Noah entered the boat . Then the flood came and killed them all .
ERV	Luke	17	28	“ It will be the same as during the time of Lot , when God destroyed Sodom . Those people were eating , drinking , buying , selling , planting , and building houses for themselves .
ERV	Luke	17	29	They were doing these things even on the day when Lot left town . Then fire and sulfur rained down from the sky and killed them all .
ERV	Luke	17	30	This is exactly how it will be when the Son of Man comes again .
ERV	Luke	17	31	“ On that day if a man is on his roof , he will not have time to go inside and get his things . If a man is in the field , he can not go back home .
ERV	Luke	17	32	Remember what happened to Lot ’ s wife [ c ] !
ERV	Luke	17	33	“ Whoever tries to keep the life they have will lose it . But whoever gives up their life will save it .
ERV	Luke	17	34	That night there may be two people sleeping in one room . One will be taken and the other will be left .
ERV	Luke	17	35	There may be two women working together . One will be taken and the other will be left. ”
ERV	Luke	17	36	: “ Two men will be in the same field . One man will be taken , but the other man will be left behind . ”
ERV	Luke	17	37	The followers asked Jesus , “ Where will this be , Lord ? ” Jesus answered , “ It ’ s like looking for a dead body—you will find it where the vultures are gathering above. ” Footnotes - Luke 17:14 show yourselves to the priests The Law of Moses said a priest must decide when a person with leprosy was well . - Luke 17:21 here with you Or “ inside you. ” - Luke 17:32 Lot ’ s wife The story about Lot ’ s wife is found in Gen. 19:15-17 ,
ERV	Luke	18	18	A religious leader asked Jesus , “ Good Teacher , what must I do to get eternal life ? ”
ERV	Luke	18	2	“ Once there was a judge in a town . He did not care about God . He also did not care what people thought about him .
ERV	Luke	18	3	In that same town there was a woman whose husband had died . She came many times to this judge and said , ‘ There is a man who is doing bad things to me . Give me my rights ! ’
ERV	Luke	18	4	But the judge did not want to help the woman . After a long time , the judge thought to himself , ‘ I don ’ t care about God . And I don ’ t care about what people think .
ERV	Luke	18	5	But this woman is bothering me . If I give her what she wants , then she will leave me alone . But if I don ’ t give her what she wants , she will bother me until I am sick. ’ ”
ERV	Luke	18	6	The Lord said , “ Listen , there is meaning in what the bad judge said .
ERV	Luke	18	7	God ’ s people shout to him night and day , and he will always give them what is right . He will not be slow to answer them .
ERV	Luke	18	8	I tell you , God will help his people quickly . But when the Son of Man comes again , will he find people on earth who believe in him ? ” Being Right With God
ERV	Luke	18	9	There were some people who thought they were very good and looked down on everyone else . Jesus used this story to teach them :
ERV	Luke	18	10	“ One time there was a Pharisee and a tax collector . One day they both went to the Temple to pray .
ERV	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee stood alone , away from the tax collector . When the Pharisee prayed , he said , ‘ O God , I thank you that I am not as bad as other people . I am not like men who steal , cheat , or commit adultery . I thank you that I am better than this tax collector .
ERV	Luke	18	12	I fast twice a week , and I give a tenth of everything I get ! ’
ERV	Luke	18	13	“ The tax collector stood alone too . But when he prayed , he would not even look up to heaven . He felt very humble before God . He said , ‘ O God , have mercy on me . I am a sinner ! ’
ERV	Luke	18	14	I tell you , when this man finished his prayer and went home , he was right with God . But the Pharisee , who felt that he was better than others , was not right with God . People who make themselves important will be made humble . But those who make themselves humble will be made important. ” Jesus Welcomes Children ( A )
ERV	Luke	18	15	Some people brought their small children to Jesus so that he could lay his hands on them to bless them . But when the followers saw this , they told the people not to do this .
ERV	Luke	18	16	But Jesus called the little children to him and said to his followers , “ Let the little children come to me . Don ’ t stop them , because God ’ s kingdom belongs to people who are like these little children .
ERV	Luke	18	17	The truth is , you must accept God ’ s kingdom like a little child accepts things , or you will never enter it. ” A Rich Man Refuses to Follow Jesus ( B )
ERV	Luke	18	19	Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call me good ? Only God is good .
ERV	Luke	18	20	And you know his commands : ‘ You must not commit adultery , you must not murder anyone , you must not steal , you must not tell lies about others , you must respect your father and mother …. ’ [ a ] ”
ERV	Luke	18	21	But the leader said , “ I have obeyed all these commands since I was a boy. ”
ERV	Luke	18	22	When Jesus heard this , he said to the leader , “ But there is still one thing you need to do . Sell everything you have and give the money to those who are poor . You will have riches in heaven . Then come and follow me. ”
ERV	Luke	18	23	But when the man heard Jesus tell him to give away his money , he was sad . He didn ’ t want to do this , because he was very rich .
ERV	Luke	18	24	When Jesus saw that the man was sad , he said , “ It will be very hard for rich people to enter God ’ s kingdom .
ERV	Luke	18	25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God ’ s kingdom. ” Who Can Be Saved ?
ERV	Luke	18	26	When the people heard this , they said , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
ERV	Luke	18	27	Jesus answered , “ God can do things that are not possible for people to do. ”
ERV	Luke	18	28	Peter said , “ Look , we left everything we had and followed you. ”
ERV	Luke	18	29	Jesus said , “ I can promise that everyone who has left their home , wife , brothers , parents , or children for God ’ s kingdom
ERV	Luke	18	30	will get much more than they left . They will get many times more in this life . And in the world that is coming they will get the reward of eternal life. ” Jesus Talks Again About His Death ( C )
ERV	Luke	18	31	Then Jesus talked to the twelve apostles alone . He said to them , “ Listen , we are going to Jerusalem . Everything that God told the prophets to write about the Son of Man will happen .
ERV	Luke	18	32	He will be handed over to the foreigners , who will laugh at him , insult him , and spit on him .
ERV	Luke	18	33	They will beat him with whips and then kill him . But on the third day after his death , he will rise to life again. ”
ERV	Luke	18	34	The apostles tried to understand this , but they could not ; the meaning was hidden from them . Jesus Heals a Blind Man ( D )
ERV	Luke	18	35	Jesus came near the city of Jericho . There was a blind man sitting beside the road . He was begging people for money .
ERV	Luke	18	36	When he heard the people coming down the road , he asked , “ What is happening ? ”
ERV	Luke	18	37	They told him , “ Jesus , the one from Nazareth , is coming here. ”
ERV	Luke	18	38	The blind man was excited and said , “ Jesus , Son of David , please help me ! ”
ERV	Luke	18	39	The people who were in front leading the group criticized the blind man . They told him to be quiet . But he shouted more and more , “ Son of David , please help me ! ”
ERV	Luke	18	40	Jesus stopped there and said , “ Bring that man to me ! ” When he came close , Jesus asked him ,
ERV	Luke	18	41	“ What do you want me to do for you ? ” He said , “ Lord , I want to see again. ”
ERV	Luke	18	42	Jesus said to him , “ You can see now . You are healed because you believed. ”
ERV	Luke	18	43	Then the man was able to see . He followed Jesus , thanking God . Everyone who saw this praised God for what happened . Footnotes - Luke 18:20 Quote from Ex . 20:12-16 ; Deut . 5:16-20 .
ERV	Luke	19	19	The king said to this servant , ‘ You can rule over five cities. ’
ERV	Luke	19	2	In Jericho there was a man named Zacchaeus . He was a wealthy , very important tax collector .
ERV	Luke	19	3	He wanted to see who Jesus was . There were many others who wanted to see Jesus too . Zacchaeus was too short to see above the people .
ERV	Luke	19	4	So he ran to a place where he knew Jesus would come . Then he climbed a sycamore tree so he could see him .
ERV	Luke	19	5	When Jesus came to where Zacchaeus was , he looked up and saw him in the tree . Jesus said , “ Zacchaeus , hurry ! Come down ! I must stay at your house today. ”
ERV	Luke	19	6	Zacchaeus hurried and came down . He was happy to have Jesus in his house .
ERV	Luke	19	7	Everyone saw this . They began to complain , “ Look at the kind of man Jesus is staying with . Zacchaeus is a sinner ! ”
ERV	Luke	19	8	Zacchaeus said to the Lord , “ I want to do good . I will give half of my money to the poor . If I have cheated anyone , I will pay them back four times more. ”
ERV	Luke	19	9	Jesus said , “ Today is the day for this family to be saved from sin . Yes , even this tax collector is one of God ’ s chosen people . [ a ]
ERV	Luke	19	10	The Son of Man came to find lost people and save them. ” Use What God Gives You ( A )
ERV	Luke	19	11	As the crowd listened to what he was saying , Jesus went on to tell a story . He was now near Jerusalem and knew that the people thought it was almost time for God ’ s kingdom to come .
ERV	Luke	19	12	So he said , “ A very important man was preparing to go to a country far away to be made a king . Then he planned to return home and rule his people .
ERV	Luke	19	13	So he called ten of his servants together . He gave a bag of money [ b ] to each servant . He said , ‘ Do business with this money until I come back. ’
ERV	Luke	19	14	But the people in the kingdom hated the man . They sent a group to follow him to the other country . There they said , ‘ We don ’ t want this man to be our king. ’
ERV	Luke	19	15	“ But the man was made king . When he came home , he said , ‘ Call those servants who have my money . I want to know how much more money they earned with it. ’
ERV	Luke	19	16	,
ERV	Luke	19	17	The king said to him , ‘ That ’ s great ! You are a good servant . I see that I can trust you with small things . So now I will let you rule over ten of my cities. ’
ERV	Luke	19	18	,
ERV	Luke	19	20	,
ERV	Luke	19	21	I was afraid of you because you are a hard man . You even take money that you didn ’ t earn and gather food that you didn ’ t grow. ’
ERV	Luke	19	22	“ Then the king said to him , ‘ What a bad servant you are ! I will use your own words to condemn you . You said that I am a hard man . You said that I even take money that I didn ’ t earn and gather food that I didn ’ t grow .
ERV	Luke	19	23	If that is true , you should have put my money in the bank . Then , when I came back , my money would have earned some interest. ’
ERV	Luke	19	24	,
ERV	Luke	19	25	. - Luke 19:46 Quote from Isa . 56:7 . - Luke 19:46 Quote from Jer . 7:11 .
ERV	Luke	19	26	“ The king said , ‘ People who use what they have will get more . But those who do not use what they have will have everything taken away from them .
ERV	Luke	19	27	Now where are my enemies ? Where are the people who did not want me to be king ? Bring my enemies here and kill them . I will watch them die. ’ ” Jesus Enters Jerusalem Like a King ( B )
ERV	Luke	19	28	After Jesus said these things , he continued traveling toward Jerusalem .
ERV	Luke	19	29	He came near Bethphage and Bethany , towns near the hill called the Mount of Olives . He sent out two of his followers .
ERV	Luke	19	30	He said , “ Go into the town you can see there . When you enter the town , you will find a young donkey tied there that no one has ever ridden . Untie it , and bring it here to me .
ERV	Luke	19	31	If anyone asks you why you are taking the donkey , you should say , ‘ The Master needs it. ’ ”
ERV	Luke	19	32	The two followers went into town . They found the donkey exactly like Jesus told them .
ERV	Luke	19	33	They untied it , but its owners came out . They said to the followers , “ Why are you untying our donkey ? ”
ERV	Luke	19	34	The followers answered , “ The Master needs it. ”
ERV	Luke	19	35	So the followers brought the donkey to Jesus . They put their coats on its back . Then they put Jesus on the donkey .
ERV	Luke	19	36	He rode along the road toward Jerusalem . The followers spread their coats on the road before him .
ERV	Luke	19	37	Jesus was coming close to Jerusalem . He was already near the bottom of the Mount of Olives . The whole group of followers was happy . They were very excited and praised God . They thanked God for all the powerful things they had seen .
ERV	Luke	19	38	They said , “ ‘ Welcome ! God bless the king who comes in the name of the Lord. ’ ( C ) Peace in heaven and glory to God ! ”
ERV	Luke	19	39	Some of the Pharisees said to Jesus , “ Teacher , tell your followers not to say these things. ”
ERV	Luke	19	40	But Jesus answered , “ I tell you , if my followers didn ’ t say them , these stones would shout them. ” Jesus Cries for Jerusalem
ERV	Luke	19	41	Jesus came near Jerusalem . Looking at the city , he began to cry for it
ERV	Luke	19	42	and said , “ I wish you knew today what would bring you peace . But it is hidden from you now .
ERV	Luke	19	43	A time is coming when your enemies will build a wall around you and hold you in on all sides .
ERV	Luke	19	44	They will destroy you and all your people . Not one stone of your buildings will stay on top of another . All this will happen because you did not know the time when God came to save you. ” Jesus Goes to the Temple ( D )
ERV	Luke	19	45	Jesus went into the Temple area . He began to throw out the people who were selling things there .
ERV	Luke	19	46	He said , “ The Scriptures say , ‘ My Temple will be a house of prayer. ’ [ c ] But you have changed it into a ‘ hiding place for thieves. ’ [ d ] ”
ERV	Luke	19	47	Jesus taught the people in the Temple area every day . The leading priests , the teachers of the law , and some of the leaders of the people wanted to kill him .
ERV	Luke	19	48	But they did not know how they could do it , because everyone was listening to him . The people were very interested in what Jesus said . Footnotes - Luke 19:9 one of God ’ s chosen people Literally , “ a son of Abraham. ” - Luke 19:13 bag of money One bag of money was a Greek mina , enough to pay a person for working three months . Also in verses
ERV	Luke	20	20	So the Jewish leaders waited for the right time to get Jesus . They sent some men to him , who pretended to be sincere . They wanted to find something wrong with what Jesus said . ( If they found something wrong , then they could hand him over to the governor , who had the authority to arrest him . )
ERV	Luke	20	2	They said , “ Tell us what authority you have to do these things . Who gave you this authority ? ”
ERV	Luke	20	3	Jesus answered , “ I will ask you a question too . Tell me :
ERV	Luke	20	4	When John baptized people , did his authority come from God or was it only from other people ? ”
ERV	Luke	20	5	The priests , the teachers of the law , and the Jewish leaders all talked about this . They said to each other , “ If we answer , ‘ John ’ s baptism was from God , ’ then he will say , ‘ Then why did you not believe John ? ’
ERV	Luke	20	6	. - Luke 20:37 burning bush See Ex . 3:1-12 . - Luke 20:37 ‘ the God of … Jacob ’ Words taken from Ex . 3:6 . - Luke 20:43 and I … power Literally , “ until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet . ”

ERV	Luke	20	8	So Jesus said to them , “ Then I will not tell you who gave me the authority to do these things. ” God Sends His Son ( B )
ERV	Luke	20	9	Then Jesus told the people this story : “ A man planted a vineyard . He leased the land to some farmers . Then he went away for a long time .
ERV	Luke	20	10	Later , it was time for the grapes to be picked . So the man sent a servant to those farmers so that they would give him his share of the grapes . But they beat the servant and sent him away with nothing .
ERV	Luke	20	11	So the man sent another servant . They beat this servant too and showed no respect for him . They sent the servant away with nothing .
ERV	Luke	20	12	So the man sent a third servant to the farmers . They hurt this servant badly and threw him out .
ERV	Luke	20	13	“ The owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What will I do now ? I will send my son . I love my son very much . Maybe the farmers will respect my son. ’
ERV	Luke	20	14	When the farmers saw the son , they said to each other , ‘ This is the owner ’ s son . This vineyard will be his . If we kill him , it will be ours. ’
ERV	Luke	20	15	So the farmers threw the son out of the vineyard and killed him . “ What will the owner of the vineyard do ?
ERV	Luke	20	16	He will come and kill those farmers . Then he will lease the land to some other farmers. ” When the people heard this story , they said , “ This should never happen ! ”
ERV	Luke	20	17	But Jesus looked into their eyes and said , “ Then what does this verse mean : ‘ The stone that the builders refused to accept became the cornerstone ’ ? ( C )
ERV	Luke	20	18	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken . If that stone falls on you , it will crush you ! ”
ERV	Luke	20	19	When the teachers of the law and the leading priests heard this story , they knew it was about them . So they wanted to arrest Jesus right then , but they were afraid of what the people would do . The Jewish Leaders Try to Trick Jesus ( D )
ERV	Luke	20	21	So the men said to Jesus , “ Teacher , we know that what you say and teach is true . It doesn ’ t matter who is listening—you teach the same to all people . You always teach the truth about God ’ s way .
ERV	Luke	20	22	Tell us , is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ”
ERV	Luke	20	23	But Jesus knew that these men were trying to trick him . He said to them ,
ERV	Luke	20	24	“ Show me a silver coin . Whose name and picture are on it ? ” They said , “ Caesar ’ s. ”
ERV	Luke	20	25	He said to them , “ Then give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar , and give to God what belongs to God. ”
ERV	Luke	20	26	The men were amazed at his wise answer . They could say nothing . They were not able to trick Jesus there in front of the people . He said nothing they could use against him . Some Sadducees Try to Trick Jesus ( E )
ERV	Luke	20	27	Some Sadducees came to Jesus . ( Sadducees believe that people will not rise from death . ) They asked him ,
ERV	Luke	20	28	“ Teacher , Moses wrote that if a married man dies and had no children , his brother must marry his widow . Then they will have children for the dead brother . [ a ]
ERV	Luke	20	29	One time there were seven brothers . The first brother married a woman but died . He had no children .
ERV	Luke	20	30	Then the second brother married the woman , and he died .
ERV	Luke	20	31	And the third brother married the woman , and he died . The same thing happened with all the other brothers . They all died and had no children .
ERV	Luke	20	32	The woman was the last to die .
ERV	Luke	20	33	But all seven brothers married her . So when people rise from death , whose wife will this woman be ? ”
ERV	Luke	20	34	Jesus said to the Sadducees , “ On earth , people marry each other .
ERV	Luke	20	35	Some people will be worthy to be raised from death and live again after this life . In that life they will not marry .
ERV	Luke	20	36	In that life people are like angels and can not die . They are children of God , because they have been raised from death .
ERV	Luke	20	37	Moses clearly showed that people are raised from death . When Moses wrote about the burning bush , [ b ] he said that the Lord is ‘ the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob. ’ [ c ]
ERV	Luke	20	38	So they were not still dead , because he is the God only of living people . Yes , to God they are all still living. ”
ERV	Luke	20	39	Some of the teachers of the law said , “ Teacher , your answer was very good. ”
ERV	Luke	20	40	No one was brave enough to ask him another question . Is the Messiah David ’ s Son or David ’ s Lord ? ( F )
ERV	Luke	20	41	Then Jesus said , “ Why do people say that the Messiah is the Son of David ?
ERV	Luke	20	42	In the book of Psalms , David himself says , ‘ The Lord God said to my Lord : Sit by me at my right side ,
ERV	Luke	20	43	and I will put your enemies under your power . [ d ] ’ ( G )
ERV	Luke	20	44	David calls the Messiah ‘ Lord. ’ So how can the Messiah also be David ’ s son ? ” Warning Against the Teachers of the Law ( H )
ERV	Luke	20	45	While all the people were listening to Jesus , he said to his followers ,
ERV	Luke	20	46	“ Be careful of the teachers of the law . They like to walk around wearing clothes that look important . And they love for people to show respect to them in the marketplaces . They love to have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets .
ERV	Luke	20	47	But they cheat widows and take their homes . Then they try to make themselves look good by saying long prayers . God will punish them very much. ” Footnotes - Luke 20:28 if … dead brother See Deut . 25:5 ,
ERV	Luke	21	21	The people in Judea at that time should run away to the mountains . The people in Jerusalem must leave quickly . If you are near the city , don ’ t go in !
ERV	Luke	21	2	Then he saw a poor widow put two small copper coins into the box .
ERV	Luke	21	3	He said , “ This poor widow gave only two small coins . But the truth is , she gave more than all those rich people .
ERV	Luke	21	4	They have plenty , and they gave only what they did not need . This woman is very poor , but she gave all she had to live on. ” Jesus Warns About the Future ( B )
ERV	Luke	21	5	Some of the followers were talking about the Temple . They said , “ This is a beautiful Temple , built with the best stones . Look at the many good gifts that have been offered to God. ”
ERV	Luke	21	6	But Jesus said , “ The time will come when all that you see here will be destroyed . Every stone of these buildings will be thrown down to the ground . Not one stone will be left on another. ”
ERV	Luke	21	7	Some followers asked Jesus , “ Teacher , when will these things happen ? What will show us that it is time for these things to happen ? ”
ERV	Luke	21	8	Jesus said , “ Be careful ! Don ’ t be fooled . Many people will come using my name . They will say , ‘ I am the Messiah [ a ] ’ and ‘ The right time has come ! ’ But don ’ t follow them .
ERV	Luke	21	9	When you hear about wars and riots , don ’ t be afraid . These things must happen first . Then the end will come later. ”
ERV	Luke	21	10	Then Jesus said to them , “ Nations will fight against other nations . Kingdoms will fight against other kingdoms .
ERV	Luke	21	11	There will be great earthquakes , sicknesses , and other bad things in many places . In some places there will be no food for the people to eat . Terrible things will happen , and amazing things will come from heaven to warn people .
ERV	Luke	21	12	“ But before all these things happen , people will arrest you and do bad things to you . They will judge you in their synagogues and put you in jail . You will be forced to stand before kings and governors . They will do all these things to you because you follow me .
ERV	Luke	21	13	But this will give you an opportunity to tell about me .
ERV	Luke	21	14	Decide now not to worry about what you will say .
ERV	Luke	21	15	I will give you the wisdom to say things that none of your enemies can answer .
ERV	Luke	21	16	Even your parents , brothers , relatives , and friends will turn against you . They will have some of you killed .
ERV	Luke	21	17	Everyone will hate you because you follow me .
ERV	Luke	21	18	But none of these things can really harm you .
ERV	Luke	21	19	You will save yourselves by continuing strong in your faith through all these things . The Destruction of Jerusalem ( C )
ERV	Luke	21	20	“ You will see armies all around Jerusalem . Then you will know that the time for its destruction has come .
ERV	Luke	21	22	The prophets wrote many things about the time when God will punish his people . The time I am talking about is when all these things must happen .
ERV	Luke	21	23	During that time it will be hard for women who are pregnant or have small babies , because very bad times will come to this land . God will be angry with these people .
ERV	Luke	21	24	Some of the people will be killed by soldiers . Others will be made prisoners and taken to all the different countries . The holy city of Jerusalem will be under the control of foreigners until their time is completed . Don ’ t Fear ( D )
ERV	Luke	21	25	“ Amazing things will happen to the sun , moon , and stars . And people all over the earth will be upset and confused by the noise of the sea and its crashing waves .
ERV	Luke	21	26	They will be afraid and worried about what will happen to the world . Everything in the sky will be changed .
ERV	Luke	21	27	Then people will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
ERV	Luke	21	28	When these things begin to happen , stand up tall and don ’ t be afraid . Know that it is almost time for God to free you ! ” My Words Will Live Forever ( E )
ERV	Luke	21	29	Then Jesus told this story : “ Look at all the trees . The fig tree is a good example .
ERV	Luke	21	30	When it turns green , you know that summer is very near .
ERV	Luke	21	31	In the same way , when you see all these things happening , you will know that God ’ s kingdom is very near .
ERV	Luke	21	32	“ I assure you that all these things will happen while some of the people of this time are still living .
ERV	Luke	21	33	The whole world , earth and sky , will be destroyed , but my words will last forever . Be Ready All the Time
ERV	Luke	21	34	“ Be careful not to spend your time having parties and getting drunk or worrying about this life . If you do that , you won ’ t be able to think straight , and the end might come when you are not ready .
ERV	Luke	21	35	It will come as a surprise to everyone on earth .

ERV	Luke	24	4	They did not understand this . While they were wondering about it , two men in shining clothes stood beside them .
ERV	Luke	24	5	The women were very afraid . They bowed down with their faces to the ground . The men said to them , “ Why are you looking for a living person here ? This is a place for dead people .
ERV	Luke	24	6	Jesus is not here . He has risen from death . Do you remember what he said in Galilee ?
ERV	Luke	24	7	He said the Son of Man must be handed over to the control of sinful men , be killed on a cross , and rise from death on the third day. ”
ERV	Luke	24	8	Then the women remembered what Jesus had said .
ERV	Luke	24	9	The women left the tomb and went to the eleven apostles and the other followers . They told them everything that happened at the tomb .
ERV	Luke	24	10	These women were Mary Magdalene , Joanna , Mary , the mother of James , and some others . They told the apostles everything that happened .

ERV	Luke	24	15	While they were talking , discussing these things , Jesus himself came near and walked with them .
ERV	Luke	24	16	( But the two men were not allowed to recognize Jesus . )
ERV	Luke	24	17	He asked them , “ What ’ s this I hear you discussing with each other as you walk ? ” The two men stopped , their faces looking very sad .
ERV	Luke	24	18	The one named Cleopas said , “ You must be the only person in Jerusalem who doesn ’ t know what has just happened there. ”
ERV	Luke	24	19	Jesus said , “ What are you talking about ? ” They said , “ It ’ s about Jesus , the one from Nazareth . To God and to all the people he was a great prophet . He said and did many powerful things .
ERV	Luke	24	20	But our leaders and the leading priests handed him over to be judged and killed . They nailed him to a cross .
ERV	Luke	24	21	We were hoping that he would be the one to free Israel . But then all this happened . “ And now something else : It has been three days since he was killed ,
ERV	Luke	24	22	but today some of our women told us an amazing thing . Early this morning they went to the tomb where the body of Jesus was laid .
ERV	Luke	24	23	But they did not find his body there . They came and told us they had seen some angels in a vision . The angels told them Jesus was alive !
ERV	Luke	24	25	Then Jesus said to the two men , “ You are foolish and slow to realize what is true . You should believe everything the prophets said .
ERV	Luke	24	26	The prophets said the Messiah must suffer these things before he begins his time of glory. ”
ERV	Luke	24	27	Then he began to explain everything that had been written about himself in the Scriptures . He started with the books of Moses and then he talked about what the prophets had said about him .
ERV	Luke	24	28	They came near the town of Emmaus , and Jesus acted as if he did not plan to stop there .
ERV	Luke	24	29	But they wanted him to stay . They begged him , “ Stay with us . It ’ s almost night . There ’ s hardly any daylight left. ” So he went in to stay with them .
ERV	Luke	24	30	Joining them at the supper table , Jesus took some bread and gave thanks . Then he broke some off and gave it to them .
ERV	Luke	24	31	Just then the men were allowed to recognize him . But when they saw who he was , he disappeared .
ERV	Luke	24	32	They said to each other , “ When he talked to us on the road , it felt like a fire burning in us . How exciting it was when he explained to us the true meaning of the Scriptures ! ”
ERV	Luke	24	33	So the two men got up then and went back to Jerusalem . There they found the followers of Jesus meeting together . The eleven apostles and the people with them
ERV	Luke	24	34	said , “ The Lord really has risen from death ! He appeared to Simon. ”
ERV	Luke	24	35	Then the two men told what had happened on the road . They talked about how they recognized Jesus when he shared the bread with them . Jesus Appears to His Followers ( C )
ERV	Luke	24	36	While the two men were saying these things to the other followers , Jesus himself came and stood among them . He said to them , “ Peace be with you. ”
ERV	Luke	24	37	This surprised the followers . They were afraid . They thought they were seeing a ghost .
ERV	Luke	24	38	But Jesus said , “ Why are you troubled ? Why do you doubt what you see ?
ERV	Luke	24	39	Look at my hands and my feet . It ’ s really me . Touch me . You can see that I have a living body ; a ghost does not have a body like this. ”
ERV	Luke	24	40	After Jesus told them this , he showed them his hands and his feet .
ERV	Luke	24	41	The followers were amazed and very , very happy to see that Jesus was alive . They still could not believe what they saw . He said to them , “ Do you have any food here ? ”
ERV	Luke	24	42	They gave him a piece of cooked fish .
ERV	Luke	24	43	While the followers watched , he took the fish and ate it .
ERV	Luke	24	44	Jesus said to them , “ Remember when I was with you before ? I said that everything written about me must happen—everything written in the Law of Moses , the books of the prophets , and the Psalms. ”
ERV	Luke	24	45	Then Jesus helped the followers understand these Scriptures about him .
ERV	Luke	24	46	Jesus said to them , “ It is written that the Messiah would be killed and rise from death on the third day . 47-48 You saw these things happen—you are witnesses . You must go and tell people that they must change and turn to God , which will bring them his forgiveness . You must start from Jerusalem and tell this message in my name to the people of all nations .

ERV	John	1	22	Then they said , “ Who are you ? Tell us about yourself . Give us an answer to tell the people who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? ”
ERV	John	1	23	John told them the words of the prophet Isaiah : “ I am the voice of someone shouting in the desert : ‘ Make a straight road ready for the Lord. ’ ” ( B )
ERV	John	1	24	. - John 1:31 so that … the Messiah Literally , “ so that he might be revealed as the Messiah to Israel. ” See “ Messiah ” in the Word List . - John 1:32 He is the Son of God Some very early Greek copies have “ He is the chosen one of God. ” - John 1:42 Peter The Greek name “ Peter , ” like the Aramaic name “ Cephas , ” means “ rock. ” - John 1:47 one you can trust Literally , “ in whom is no deceit. ” In the Old Testament , Israel ’ s other name , Jacob , is explained with words that mean “ deceit ” or “ trickery , ” for which he was well known . See Gen. 27:35 ,
ERV	John	1	25	They said to John , “ You say you are not the Messiah . You say you are not Elijah or the Prophet . Then why do you baptize people ? ”
ERV	John	1	26	John answered , “ I baptize people with water . But there is someone here with you that you don ’ t know .
ERV	John	1	27	He is the one who is coming later . I am not good enough to be the slave who unties the strings on his sandals. ”
ERV	John	1	28	These things all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan River . This is where John was baptizing people . Jesus , the Lamb of God
ERV	John	1	29	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said , “ Look , the Lamb of God . He takes away the sins of the world !
ERV	John	1	30	This is the one I was talking about when I said , ‘ There is a man coming after me who is greater than I am , because he was living even before I was born. ’
ERV	John	1	31	I did not know who he was . But I came baptizing people with water so that Israel could know that he is the Messiah . [ g ] ” 32-34 Then John said this for everyone to hear : “ I also did not know who the Messiah was . But the one who sent me to baptize with water told me , ‘ You will see the Spirit come down and rest on a man . He is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit. ’ I have seen this happen . I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on this man . So this is what I tell people : ‘ He is the Son of God. ’ [ h ] ” The First Followers of Jesus
ERV	John	1	35	The next day John was there again and had two of his followers with him .
ERV	John	1	36	. - John 1:51 Quote from Gen. 28:12 .
ERV	John	1	37	The two followers heard him say this , so they followed Jesus .
ERV	John	1	38	Jesus turned and saw the two men following him . He asked , “ What do you want ? ” They said , “ Rabbi , where are you staying ? ” ( “ Rabbi ” means “ Teacher. ” )
ERV	John	1	39	He answered , “ Come with me and you will see. ” So the two men went with him . They saw the place where he was staying , and they stayed there with him that day . It was about four o ’ clock .
ERV	John	1	40	These men followed Jesus after they had heard about him from John . One of them was Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter .
ERV	John	1	41	The first thing Andrew did was to go and find his brother Simon . Andrew said to him , “ We have found the Messiah. ” ( “ Messiah ” means “ Christ. ” )
ERV	John	1	42	Then Andrew brought Simon to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , “ You are Simon , the son of John . You will be called Cephas. ” ( “ Cephas ” means “ Peter . [ i ] ” )
ERV	John	1	43	The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee . He met Philip and said to him , “ Follow me. ”
ERV	John	1	44	Philip was from the town of Bethsaida , the same as Andrew and Peter .
ERV	John	1	45	Philip found Nathanael and told him , “ We have found the man that Moses wrote about in the law . The prophets wrote about him too . He is Jesus , the son of Joseph . He is from Nazareth. ”
ERV	John	1	46	But Nathanael said to Philip , “ Nazareth ! Can anything good come from Nazareth ? ” Philip answered , “ Come and see. ”
ERV	John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said , “ This man coming is a true Israelite , one you can trust . [ j ] ”
ERV	John	1	48	Nathanael asked , “ How do you know me ? ” Jesus answered , “ I saw you when you were under the fig tree , before Philip told you about me. ”
ERV	John	1	49	Then Nathanael said , “ Teacher , you are the Son of God . You are the King of Israel. ”
ERV	John	1	50	Jesus said to him , “ Do you believe this just because I said I saw you under the fig tree ? You will see much greater things than that ! ”
ERV	John	1	51	Then he said , “ Believe me when I say that you will all see heaven open . You will see ‘ angels of God going up and coming down ’ [ k ] on the Son of Man. ” Footnotes - John 1:1 Word The Greek word is “ logos , ” meaning any kind of communication . It could be translated “ message. ” Here , it describes Jesus Christ before he was sent to earth as a human being , which is the way God chose to tell the world about himself . Also in verses
ERV	John	2	2	Jesus and his followers were also invited .
ERV	John	2	3	At the wedding there was not enough wine , so Jesus ’ mother said to him , “ They have no more wine. ”
ERV	John	2	4	Jesus answered , “ Dear woman , why are you telling me this ? It is not yet time for me to begin my work. ”
ERV	John	2	5	His mother said to the servants , “ Do what he tells you. ”
ERV	John	2	6	There were six large stone waterpots there that were used by the Jews in their washing ceremonies . [ a ] Each one held about
ERV	John	2	20	They answered , “ People worked
ERV	John	2	30	gallons . [ b ]
ERV	John	2	7	Jesus said to the servants , “ Fill the waterpots with water. ” So they filled them to the top .
ERV	John	2	8	Then he said to them , “ Now dip out some water and take it to the man in charge of the feast. ” So they did what he said .
ERV	John	2	9	Then the man in charge tasted it , but the water had become wine . He did not know where the wine had come from , but the servants who brought the water knew . He called the bridegroom
ERV	John	2	10	and said to him , “ People always serve the best wine first . Later , when the guests are drunk , they serve the cheaper wine . But you have saved the best wine until now. ”
ERV	John	2	11	This was the first of all the miraculous signs Jesus did . He did it in the town of Cana in Galilee . By this he showed his divine greatness , and his followers believed in him .
ERV	John	2	12	Then Jesus went to the town of Capernaum . His mother and brothers and his followers went with him . They all stayed there a few days . Jesus at the Temple ( A )
ERV	John	2	13	It was almost time for the Jewish Passover , so Jesus went to Jerusalem .
ERV	John	2	14	There in the Temple area he saw men selling cattle , sheep , and doves . He saw others sitting at tables , exchanging and trading people ’ s money .
ERV	John	2	15	Jesus made a whip with some pieces of rope . Then he forced all these men and the sheep and cattle to leave the Temple area . He turned over the tables of the money traders and scattered their money .
ERV	John	2	16	Then he said to those who were selling pigeons , “ Take these things out of here ! Don ’ t make my Father ’ s house a place for buying and selling ! ”
ERV	John	2	17	When this happened , his followers remembered what was written in the Scriptures : “ My strong devotion to your Temple will destroy me. ” ( B )
ERV	John	2	18	Some Jews said to Jesus , “ Show us a miracle as a sign from God . Prove that you have the right to do these things. ”
ERV	John	2	19	Jesus answered , “ Destroy this temple and I will build it again in three days. ”
ERV	John	2	46	years to build this Temple ! Do you really believe you can build it again in three days ? ”
ERV	John	2	21	But the temple Jesus meant was his own body .
ERV	John	2	22	After he was raised from death , his followers remembered that he had said this . So they believed the Scriptures , and they believed the words Jesus said .
ERV	John	2	23	Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Passover festival . Many people believed in him because they saw the miraculous signs he did .
ERV	John	2	24	But Jesus did not trust them , because he knew how all people think .
ERV	John	2	25	He did not need anyone to tell him what a person was like . He already knew .
ERV	John	3	3	Jesus answered , “ I assure you , everyone must be born again . Anyone who is not born again can not be in God ’ s kingdom. ”
ERV	John	3	2	One night he came to Jesus and said , “ Teacher , we know that you are a teacher sent from God . No one can do these miraculous signs that you do unless they have God ’ s help. ”
ERV	John	3	4	Nicodemus said , “ How can a man who is already old be born again ? Can he go back into his mother ’ s womb and be born a second time ? ”
ERV	John	3	5	Jesus answered , “ Believe me when I say that everyone must be born from water and the Spirit . Anyone who is not born from water and the Spirit can not enter God ’ s kingdom .
ERV	John	3	6	The only life people get from their human parents is physical . But the new life that the Spirit gives a person is spiritual .
ERV	John	3	7	Don ’ t be surprised that I told you , ‘ You must be born again. ’
ERV	John	3	8	The wind blows wherever it wants to . You hear it , but you don ’ t know where it is coming from or where it is going . It is the same with everyone who is born from the Spirit. ”
ERV	John	3	9	Nicodemus asked , “ How is all this possible ? ”
ERV	John	3	10	Jesus said , “ You are an important teacher of Israel , and you still don ’ t understand these things ?
ERV	John	3	11	The truth is , we talk about what we know . We tell about what we have seen . But you people don ’ t accept what we tell you .
ERV	John	3	12	I have told you about things here on earth , but you do not believe me . So I ’ m sure you will not believe me if I tell you about heavenly things !
ERV	John	3	13	The only one who has ever gone up to heaven is the one who came down from heaven—the Son of Man .
ERV	John	3	14	“ Moses lifted up the snake in the desert . [ a ] It is the same with the Son of Man . He must be lifted up too .
ERV	John	3	15	Then everyone who believes in him can have eternal life. ” [ b ]
ERV	John	3	16	Yes , God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son , so that everyone who believes in him would not be lost but have eternal life .
ERV	John	3	17	God sent his Son into the world . He did not send him to judge the world guilty , but to save the world through him .
ERV	John	3	18	People who believe in God ’ s Son are not judged guilty . But people who do not believe are already judged , because they have not believed in God ’ s only Son .
ERV	John	3	19	They are judged by this fact : The light [ c ] has come into the world . But they did not want light . They wanted darkness , because they were doing evil things .
ERV	John	3	20	Everyone who does evil hates the light . They will not come to the light , because the light will show all the bad things they have done .
ERV	John	3	21	. - John 3:19 light This means Christ , the Word , who brought to the world understanding about God . - John 3:25 religious washing The Jews had religious rules about washing in special ways before eating , before worshiping in the Temple , and at other special times .
ERV	John	3	22	After this , Jesus and his followers went into the area of Judea . There he stayed with his followers and baptized people .
ERV	John	3	23	John was also baptizing people in Aenon , a place near Salim with plenty of water . People were going there to be baptized .
ERV	John	3	24	This was before John was put in prison .
ERV	John	3	25	Some of John ’ s followers had an argument with another Jew about religious washing . [ d ]
ERV	John	3	26	Then they came to John and said , “ Teacher , remember the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River ? He is the one you were telling everyone about . He is also baptizing people , and many are going to him. ”
ERV	John	3	27	John answered , “ A person can receive only what God gives .
ERV	John	3	28	You yourselves heard me say , ‘ I am not the Messiah . I am only the one God sent to prepare the way for him. ’
ERV	John	3	29	The bride always belongs to the bridegroom . The friend who helps the bridegroom just waits and listens . He is happy just to hear the bridegroom talk . That ’ s how I feel now . I am so happy that he is here .
ERV	John	3	30	He must become more and more important , and I must become less important . The One Who Comes From Heaven
ERV	John	3	31	“ The one who comes from above is greater than all others . The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth . He talks about things that are on the earth . But the one who comes from heaven is greater than all others .
ERV	John	3	32	He tells what he has seen and heard , but people don ’ t accept what he says .
ERV	John	3	33	Whoever accepts what he says has given proof that God speaks the truth .
ERV	John	3	34	God sent him , and he tells people what God says . God gives him the Spirit fully .
ERV	John	3	35	The Father loves the Son and has given him power over everything .
ERV	John	3	36	Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life . But those who do not obey the Son will never have that life . They can not get away from God ’ s anger. ” Footnotes - John 3:14 Moses lifted … desert When God ’ s people were dying from snake bites , God told Moses to put a brass snake on a pole for them to look at and be healed . See Num . 21:4-9 . - John 3:15 Some scholars think that Jesus ’ words to Nicodemus continue through verse
ERV	John	4	4	On the way to Galilee , he had to go through the country of Samaria .
ERV	John	4	2	( But really , Jesus himself did not baptize anyone ; his followers baptized people for him . )
ERV	John	4	3	So he left Judea and went back to Galilee .
ERV	John	4	5	In Samaria Jesus came to the town called Sychar , which is near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
ERV	John	4	6	Jacob ’ s well was there . Jesus was tired from his long trip , so he sat down beside the well . It was about noon .
ERV	John	4	7	A Samaritan woman came to the well to get some water , and Jesus said to her , “ Please give me a drink. ”
ERV	John	4	8	This happened while his followers were in town buying some food .
ERV	John	4	9	The woman answered , “ I am surprised that you ask me for a drink ! You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman ! ” ( Jews have nothing to do with Samaritans . [ a ] )
ERV	John	4	10	Jesus answered , “ You don ’ t know what God can give you . And you don ’ t know who I am , the one who asked you for a drink . If you knew , you would have asked me , and I would have given you living water. ”
ERV	John	4	11	The woman said , “ Sir , where will you get that living water ? The well is very deep , and you have nothing to get water with .
ERV	John	4	12	Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob ? He is the one who gave us this well . He drank from it himself , and his sons and all his animals drank from it too. ”
ERV	John	4	13	Jesus answered , “ Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again .
ERV	John	4	14	But anyone who drinks the water I give will never be thirsty again . The water I give people will be like a spring flowing inside them . It will bring them eternal life. ”
ERV	John	4	15	The woman said to Jesus , “ Sir , give me this water . Then I will never be thirsty again and won ’ t have to come back here to get more water. ”
ERV	John	4	16	Jesus told her , “ Go get your husband and come back. ”
ERV	John	4	17	The woman answered , “ But I have no husband. ” Jesus said to her , “ You are right to say you have no husband .
ERV	John	4	18	That ’ s because , although you have had five husbands , the man you live with now is not your husband . That much was the truth. ”
ERV	John	4	19	The woman said , “ Sir , I can see that you are a prophet . [ b ]
ERV	John	4	20	Our fathers worshiped on this mountain . But you Jews say that Jerusalem is the place where people must worship. ”
ERV	John	4	21	Jesus said , “ Believe me , woman ! The time is coming when you will not have to be in Jerusalem or on this mountain to worship the Father .
ERV	John	4	22	You Samaritans worship something you don ’ t understand . We Jews understand what we worship , since salvation comes from the Jews .
ERV	John	4	23	But the time is coming when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth . In fact , that time is now here . And these are the kind of people the Father wants to be his worshipers .
ERV	John	4	24	God is spirit . So the people who worship him must worship in spirit and truth. ”
ERV	John	4	25	The woman said , “ I know that the Messiah is coming. ” ( He is the one called Christ . ) “ When he comes , he will explain everything to us. ”
ERV	John	4	26	Then Jesus said , “ He is talking to you now—I am the Messiah. ”
ERV	John	4	27	Just then Jesus ’ followers came back from town . They were surprised because they saw Jesus talking with a woman . But none of them asked , “ What do you want ? ” or “ Why are you talking with her ? ”
ERV	John	4	28	Then the woman left her water jar and went back to town . She told the people there ,
ERV	John	4	29	“ A man told me everything I have ever done . Come see him . Maybe he is the Messiah. ”
ERV	John	4	30	So the people left the town and went to see Jesus .
ERV	John	4	31	While the woman was in town , Jesus ’ followers were begging him , “ Teacher , eat something ! ”
ERV	John	4	32	But Jesus answered , “ I have food to eat that you know nothing about. ”
ERV	John	4	33	So the followers asked themselves , “ Did someone already bring him some food ? ”
ERV	John	4	34	Jesus said , “ My food is to do what the one who sent me wants me to do . My food is to finish the work that he gave me to do .
ERV	John	4	35	When you plant , you always say , ‘ Four more months to wait before we gather the grain. ’ But I tell you , open your eyes , and look at the fields . They are ready for harvesting now .
ERV	John	4	36	Even now , the people who harvest the crop are being paid . They are gathering crops for eternal life . So now the people who plant can be happy together with those who harvest .
ERV	John	4	37	It is true when we say , ‘ One person plants , but another person harvests the crop. ’
ERV	John	4	38	I sent you to harvest a crop that you did not work for . Others did the work , and you get the profit from their work. ”
ERV	John	4	39	Many of the Samaritan people in that town believed in Jesus . They believed because of what the woman had told them about him . She had told them , “ He told me everything I have ever done. ”
ERV	John	4	40	The Samaritans went to Jesus . They begged him to stay with them . So he stayed there two days .
ERV	John	4	41	Many more people became believers because of the things he said .
ERV	John	4	42	The people said to the woman , “ First we believed in Jesus because of what you told us . But now we believe because we heard him ourselves . We know now that he really is the one who will save the world. ” Jesus Heals an Official ’ s Son ( A )
ERV	John	4	43	Two days later Jesus left and went to Galilee .
ERV	John	4	44	( Jesus had said before that a prophet is not respected in his own country . )
ERV	John	4	45	When he arrived in Galilee , the people there welcomed him . They had been at the Passover festival in Jerusalem and had seen everything he did there .
ERV	John	4	46	Jesus went to visit Cana in Galilee again . Cana is where he had changed the water into wine . One of the king ’ s important officials lived in the city of Capernaum . This man ’ s son was sick .
ERV	John	4	47	The man heard that Jesus had come from Judea and was now in Galilee . So he went to Jesus and begged him to come to Capernaum and heal his son , who was almost dead .
ERV	John	4	48	Jesus said to him , “ You people must see miraculous signs and wonders before you will believe in me. ”
ERV	John	4	49	The king ’ s official said , “ Sir , come before my little son dies. ”
ERV	John	4	50	Jesus answered , “ Go . Your son will live. ” The man believed what Jesus told him and went home .
ERV	John	4	51	On the way home , the man ’ s servants came and met him . They said , “ Your son is well. ”
ERV	John	4	52	The man asked , “ What time did my son begin to get well ? ” They answered , “ It was about one o ’ clock yesterday when the fever left him. ”
ERV	John	4	53	The father knew that one o ’ clock was the same time that Jesus had said , “ Your son will live. ” So the man and everyone in his house believed in Jesus .
ERV	John	4	54	That was the second miraculous sign that Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee .
ERV	John	5	5	One of the men lying there had been sick for
ERV	John	5	2	In Jerusalem there is a pool with five covered porches . In Aramaic it is called Bethzatha . [ a ] This pool is near the Sheep Gate .
ERV	John	5	3	, some Greek copies add “ and they waited for the water to move. ” - John 5:4 A few later copies add verse
ERV	John	5	4	: “ Sometimes an angel of the Lord came down to the pool and shook the water . After this , the first person to go into the pool was healed from any sickness he had . ”
ERV	John	5	38	The Father ’ s teaching does not live in you , because you don ’ t believe in the one the Father sent .
ERV	John	5	6	Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been sick for a very long time . So he asked him , “ Do you want to be well ? ”
ERV	John	5	7	The sick man answered , “ Sir , there is no one to help me get into the water when it starts moving . I try to be the first one into the water . But when I try , someone else always goes in before I can. ”
ERV	John	5	8	Then Jesus said , “ Stand up ! Pick up your mat and walk. ”
ERV	John	5	9	Immediately the man was well . He picked up his mat and started walking . The day all this happened was a Sabbath day .
ERV	John	5	10	So some Jews said to the man who had been healed , “ Today is the Sabbath . It is against our law for you to carry your mat on the Sabbath day. ”
ERV	John	5	11	But he answered , “ The man who made me well told me , ‘ Pick up your mat and walk. ’ ”
ERV	John	5	12	They asked him , “ Who is the man who told you to pick up your mat and walk ? ”
ERV	John	5	13	But the man who had been healed did not know who it was . There were many people there , and Jesus had left .
ERV	John	5	14	Later , Jesus found the man at the Temple and said to him , “ See , you are well now . But stop sinning or something worse may happen to you ! ”
ERV	John	5	15	Then the man left and went back to the Jews who questioned him . He told them that Jesus was the one who made him well .
ERV	John	5	16	Jesus was doing all this on the Sabbath day . So these Jews began trying to make him stop .
ERV	John	5	17	But he said to them , “ My Father never stops working , and so I work too. ”
ERV	John	5	18	This made them even more determined to kill him . They thought it was bad enough that he was breaking the law about the Sabbath day . And now he was saying that God is his Father , making himself equal with God ! Jesus Has God ’ s Authority
ERV	John	5	19	But Jesus answered , “ I assure you that the Son can do nothing alone . He does only what he sees his Father doing . The Son does the same things that the Father does .
ERV	John	5	20	The Father loves the Son and shows him everything he does . This man was healed . But the Father will show the Son greater things than this to do . Then you will all be amazed .
ERV	John	5	21	The Father raises the dead and gives them life . In the same way , the Son gives life to those he wants to .
ERV	John	5	22	“ Also , the Father judges no one . He has given the Son power to do all the judging .
ERV	John	5	23	God did this so that all people will respect the Son the same as they respect the Father . Anyone who does not respect the Son does not respect the Father . He is the one who sent the Son .
ERV	John	5	24	“ I assure you , anyone who hears what I say and believes in the one who sent me has eternal life . They will not be judged guilty . They have already left death and have entered into life .
ERV	John	5	25	Believe me , an important time is coming . That time is already here . People who are dead will hear the voice of the Son of God . And those who listen will live .
ERV	John	5	26	Life comes from the Father himself . So the Father has also allowed the Son to give life .
ERV	John	5	27	And the Father has given him the power to judge all people because he is the Son of Man .
ERV	John	5	28	“ Don ’ t be surprised at this . A time is coming when all people who are dead and in their graves will hear his voice .
ERV	John	5	29	Then they will come out of their graves . Those who did good in this life will rise and have eternal life . But those who did evil will rise to be judged guilty .
ERV	John	5	30	“ I can do nothing alone . I judge only the way I am told . And my judgment is right , because I am not trying to please myself . I want only to please the one who sent me . Jesus Says More to the Jewish Leaders
ERV	John	5	31	“ If I tell people about myself , they can not be sure that what I say is true .
ERV	John	5	32	But there is someone else who tells people about me , and I know that what he says about me is true .
ERV	John	5	33	“ You sent men to John , and he told you what is true .
ERV	John	5	34	I don ’ t need anyone to tell people about me , but I remind you of what John said so that you can be saved .
ERV	John	5	35	John was like a lamp that burned and gave light , and you were happy to enjoy his light for a while .
ERV	John	5	36	“ But I have a proof about myself that is greater than anything John said . The things I do are my proof . These are what my Father gave me to do . They show that the Father sent me .
ERV	John	5	37	And the Father who sent me has given proof about me himself . But you have never heard his voice . You have never seen what he looks like .
ERV	John	5	39	You carefully study the Scriptures . You think that they give you eternal life . These same Scriptures tell about me !
ERV	John	5	40	But you refuse to come to me to have that life .
ERV	John	5	41	“ I don ’ t want praise from you or any other human .
ERV	John	5	42	But I know you—I know that you have no love for God .
ERV	John	5	43	I have come from my Father and speak for him , but you don ’ t accept me . But when other people come speaking only for themselves , you accept them .
ERV	John	5	44	You like to have praise from each other . But you never try to get the praise that comes from the only God . So how can you believe ?
ERV	John	5	45	Don ’ t think that I will be the one to stand before the Father and accuse you . Moses is the one to accuse you . And he is the one you hoped would save you .
ERV	John	5	46	If you really believed Moses , you would believe me , because he wrote about me .
ERV	John	5	47	But you don ’ t believe what he wrote , so you can ’ t believe what I say. ” Footnotes - John 5:2 Bethzatha Also called Bethsaida or Bethesda , a pool of water north of the Temple in Jerusalem . - John 5:3 At the end of verse
ERV	John	6	6	He asked Philip this question to test him . Jesus already knew what he planned to do .
ERV	John	6	5000	men sat down there .
ERV	John	6	2	A great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he did in healing the sick .
ERV	John	6	3	Jesus went up on the side of the hill and sat there with his followers .
ERV	John	6	4	It was almost the time for the Jewish Passover festival .
ERV	John	6	5	Jesus looked up and saw a crowd of people coming toward him . He said to Philip , “ Where can we buy enough bread for all these people to eat ? ”
ERV	John	6	7	Philip answered , “ We would all have to work a month to buy enough bread for each person here to have only a little piece ! ”
ERV	John	6	8	Another follower there was Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter . Andrew said ,
ERV	John	6	9	“ Here is a boy with five loaves of barley bread and two little fish . But that is not enough for so many people. ”
ERV	John	6	10	Jesus said , “ Tell everyone to sit down. ” This was a place with a lot of grass , and about
ERV	John	6	11	Jesus took the loaves of bread and gave thanks for them . Then he gave them to the people who were waiting to eat . He did the same with the fish . He gave them as much as they wanted .
ERV	John	6	12	They all had plenty to eat . When they finished , Jesus said to his followers , “ Gather the pieces of fish and bread that were not eaten . Don ’ t waste anything. ”
ERV	John	6	13	So they gathered up the pieces that were left . The people had started eating with only five loaves of barley bread . But the followers filled twelve large baskets with the pieces of food that were left .
ERV	John	6	14	The people saw this miraculous sign that Jesus did and said , “ He must be the Prophet [ a ] who is coming into the world. ”
ERV	John	6	15	Jesus knew that the people planned to come get him and make him their king . So he left and went into the hills alone . Jesus Walks on Water ( B )
ERV	John	6	16	That evening Jesus ’ followers went down to the lake .
ERV	John	6	17	It was dark now , and Jesus had not yet come back to them . They got into a boat and started going across the lake to Capernaum .
ERV	John	6	18	The wind was blowing very hard . The waves on the lake were becoming bigger .
ERV	John	6	19	They rowed the boat about three or four miles . [ b ] Then they saw Jesus . He was walking on the water , coming to the boat . They were afraid .
ERV	John	6	20	But he said to them , “ Don ’ t be afraid . It ’ s me. ”
ERV	John	6	21	When he said this , they were glad to take him into the boat . And then the boat reached the shore at the place they wanted to go . The People Look for Jesus
ERV	John	6	22	The next day came . Some people had stayed on the other side of the lake . They knew that Jesus did not go with his followers in the boat . They knew that the followers had left in the boat alone . And they knew it was the only boat that was there .
ERV	John	6	23	But then some boats from Tiberias came and landed near the place where the people had eaten the day before . This was where they had eaten the bread after the Lord gave thanks .
ERV	John	6	24	The people saw that Jesus and his followers were not there now . So they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to find Jesus . Jesus , the Bread of Life
ERV	John	6	25	The people found Jesus on the other side of the lake . They asked him , “ Teacher , when did you come here ? ”
ERV	John	6	26	He answered , “ Why are you looking for me ? Is it because you saw miraculous signs ? The truth is , you are looking for me because you ate the bread and were satisfied .
ERV	John	6	27	But earthly food spoils and ruins . So don ’ t work to get that kind of food . But work to get the food that stays good and gives you eternal life . The Son of Man will give you that food . He is the only one qualified by God the Father to give it to you. ”
ERV	John	6	28	The people asked Jesus , “ What does God want us to do ? ”
ERV	John	6	29	Jesus answered , “ The work God wants you to do is this : to believe in the one he sent. ”
ERV	John	6	30	So the people asked , “ What miraculous sign will you do for us ? If we can see you do a miracle , then we will believe you . What will you do ?
ERV	John	6	31	Our ancestors were given manna to eat in the desert . As the Scriptures say , ‘ He gave them bread from heaven to eat. ’ [ c ] ”
ERV	John	6	32	Jesus said , “ I can assure you that Moses was not the one who gave your people bread from heaven . But my Father gives you the true bread from heaven .
ERV	John	6	33	God ’ s bread is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. ”
ERV	John	6	34	The people said , “ Sir , from now on give us bread like that. ”
ERV	John	6	35	Then Jesus said , “ I am the bread that gives life . No one who comes to me will ever be hungry . No one who believes in me will ever be thirsty .
ERV	John	6	36	I told you before that you have seen me , and still you don ’ t believe .
ERV	John	6	37	The Father gives me my people . Every one of them will come to me . I will always accept them .
ERV	John	6	38	I came down from heaven to do what God wants , not what I want .
ERV	John	6	39	I must not lose anyone God has given me . But I must raise them up on the last day . This is what the one who sent me wants me to do .
ERV	John	6	40	Everyone who sees the Son and believes in him has eternal life . I will raise them up on the last day . This is what my Father wants. ”
ERV	John	6	41	Some Jews began to complain about Jesus because he said , “ I am the bread that comes down from heaven. ”
ERV	John	6	42	They said , “ This is Jesus . We know his father and mother . He is only Joseph ’ s son . How can he say , ‘ I came down from heaven ’ ? ”
ERV	John	6	43	But Jesus said , “ Stop complaining to each other .
ERV	John	6	44	The Father is the one who sent me , and he is the one who brings people to me . I will raise them up on the last day . Anyone the Father does not bring to me can not come to me .
ERV	John	6	45	It is written in the prophets : ‘ God will teach them all. ’ [ d ] People listen to the Father and learn from him . They are the ones who come to me .
ERV	John	6	46	I don ’ t mean that there is anyone who has seen the Father . The only one who has ever seen the Father is the one who came from God . He has seen the Father .
ERV	John	6	47	“ I can assure you that anyone who believes has eternal life .
ERV	John	6	48	I am the bread that gives life .
ERV	John	6	49	Your ancestors ate the manna God gave them in the desert , but it didn ’ t keep them from dying .
ERV	John	6	50	Here is the bread that comes down from heaven . Whoever eats this bread will never die .
ERV	John	6	51	I am the living bread that came down from heaven . Whoever eats this bread will live forever . This bread is my body . I will give my body so that the people in the world can have life. ”
ERV	John	6	52	Then the Jews began to argue among themselves . They said , “ How can this man give us his body to eat ? ”
ERV	John	6	53	Jesus said , “ Believe me when I say that you must eat the body of the Son of Man , and you must drink his blood . If you don ’ t do this , you have no real life .
ERV	John	6	54	Those who eat my body and drink my blood have eternal life . I will raise them up on the last day .
ERV	John	6	55	My body is true food , and my blood is true drink .
ERV	John	6	56	Those who eat my body and drink my blood live in me , and I live in them .
ERV	John	6	57	“ The Father sent me . He lives , and I live because of him . So everyone who eats me will live because of me .
ERV	John	6	58	I am not like the bread that your ancestors ate . They ate that bread , but they still died . I am the bread that came down from heaven . Whoever eats this bread will live forever. ”
ERV	John	6	59	Jesus said all this while he was teaching in the synagogue in the city of Capernaum . Many Followers Leave Jesus
ERV	John	6	60	When Jesus ’ followers heard this , many of them said , “ This teaching is hard . Who can accept it ? ”
ERV	John	6	61	Jesus already knew that his followers were complaining about this . So he said , “ Is this teaching a problem for you ?
ERV	John	6	62	Then what will you think when you see the Son of Man going up to where he came from ?
ERV	John	6	63	It is the Spirit that gives life . The body is of no value for that . But the things I have told you are from the Spirit , so they give life .
ERV	John	6	64	But some of you don ’ t believe. ” ( Jesus knew the people who did not believe . He knew this from the beginning . And he knew the one who would hand him over to his enemies . )
ERV	John	6	65	Jesus said , “ That is why I said , ‘ Anyone the Father does not help to come to me can not come. ’ ”
ERV	John	6	66	After Jesus said these things , many of his followers left and stopped following him .
ERV	John	6	67	Jesus asked the twelve apostles , “ Do you want to leave too ? ”
ERV	John	6	68	Simon Peter answered him , “ Lord , where would we go ? You have the words that give eternal life .
ERV	John	6	69	We believe in you . We know that you are the Holy One from God. ”
ERV	John	6	70	Then Jesus answered , “ I chose all twelve of you . But one of you is a devil. ”
ERV	John	6	71	He was talking about Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot . Judas was one of the twelve apostles , but later he would hand Jesus over to his enemies .
ERV	John	7	7	The world can not hate you . But the world hates me , because I tell the people in the world that they do evil things .
ERV	John	7	2	It was time for the Jewish Festival of Shelters .
ERV	John	7	3	So his brothers said to him , “ You should leave here and go to the festival in Judea . Then your followers there can see the miracles you do .
ERV	John	7	4	If you want to be well known , you must not hide what you do . So , if you can do such amazing things , let the whole world see you do them. ”
ERV	John	7	5	Jesus ’ brothers said this because even they did not believe in him .
ERV	John	7	6	Jesus said to them , “ The right time for me has not yet come , but any time is right for you to go .
ERV	John	7	8	So you go to the festival . I will not go now , because the right time for me has not yet come. ”
ERV	John	7	9	After Jesus said this , he stayed in Galilee .
ERV	John	7	10	So his brothers left to go to the festival . After they left , Jesus went too , but he did not let people see him .
ERV	John	7	11	At the festival the Jewish leaders were looking for him . They said , “ Where is that man ? ”
ERV	John	7	12	There was a large group of people there . Many of them were talking secretly to each other about Jesus . Some people said , “ He is a good man. ” But others said , “ No , he fools the people. ”
ERV	John	7	13	But no one was brave enough to talk about him openly . They were afraid of the Jewish leaders . Jesus Teaches in Jerusalem
ERV	John	7	14	When the festival was about half finished , Jesus went to the Temple area and began to teach .
ERV	John	7	15	The Jewish leaders were amazed and said , “ How did this man learn so much ? He never had the kind of teaching we had ! ”
ERV	John	7	16	Jesus answered , “ What I teach is not my own . My teaching comes from the one who sent me .
ERV	John	7	17	People who really want to do what God wants will know that my teaching comes from God . They will know that this teaching is not my own .
ERV	John	7	18	If I taught my own ideas , I would just be trying to get honor for myself . But if I am trying to bring honor to the one who sent me , I can be trusted . Anyone doing that is not going to lie .
ERV	John	7	19	Moses gave you the law , right ? But you don ’ t obey that law . If you do , then why are you trying to kill me ? ”
ERV	John	7	20	The people answered , “ A demon is making you crazy ! We are not trying to kill you. ”
ERV	John	7	21	Jesus said to them , “ I did one miracle on a Sabbath day , and you were all surprised .
ERV	John	7	22	But you obey the law Moses gave you about circumcision—and sometimes you do it on a Sabbath day . ( Really , Moses is not the one who gave you circumcision . It came from our ancestors who lived before Moses . ) Yes , you often circumcise baby boys on a Sabbath day .
ERV	John	7	23	This shows that someone can be circumcised on a Sabbath day to obey the Law of Moses . So why are you angry with me for healing a person ’ s whole body on the Sabbath day ?
ERV	John	7	24	Stop judging by the way things look . Be fair and judge by what is really right. ” People Wonder if Jesus Is the Messiah
ERV	John	7	25	Then some of the people who lived in Jerusalem said , “ This is the man they are trying to kill .
ERV	John	7	26	But he is teaching where everyone can see and hear him . And no one is trying to stop him from teaching . Maybe the leaders have decided that he really is the Messiah .
ERV	John	7	27	But when the real Messiah comes , no one will know where he comes from . And we know where this man ’ s home is. ”
ERV	John	7	28	Jesus was still teaching in the Temple area when he said loudly , “ Do you really know me and where I am from ? I am here , but not by my own decision . I was sent by one who is very real . But you don ’ t know him .
ERV	John	7	29	I know him because I am from him . He is the one who sent me. ”
ERV	John	7	30	When Jesus said this , the people tried to grab him . But no one was able even to touch him , because the right time for him had not yet come .
ERV	John	7	31	But many of the people believed in Jesus . They said , “ We are waiting for the Messiah to come . When he comes , will he do more miraculous signs than this man has done ? ” The Jewish Leaders Try to Arrest Jesus
ERV	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard what the people were saying about Jesus . So the leading priests and the Pharisees sent some Temple police to arrest him .
ERV	John	7	33	Then Jesus said , “ I will be with you a little while longer . Then I will go back to the one who sent me .
ERV	John	7	34	You will look for me , but you will not find me . And you can not come where I am. ”
ERV	John	7	35	These Jews said to each other , “ Where will this man go that we can not find him ? Will he go to the Greek cities where our people live ? Will he teach the Greek people there ?
ERV	John	7	36	He says , ‘ You will look for me , but you will not find me. ’ He also says , ‘ You can not come where I am. ’ What does this mean ? ” Jesus Talks About the Holy Spirit
ERV	John	7	37	The last day of the festival came . It was the most important day . On that day Jesus stood up and said loudly , “ Whoever is thirsty may come to me and drink .
ERV	John	7	38	If anyone believes in me , rivers of living water will flow out from their heart . That is what the Scriptures say. ”
ERV	John	7	39	Jesus was talking about the Spirit . The Spirit had not yet been given to people , because Jesus had not yet been raised to glory . But later , those who believed in Jesus would receive the Spirit . The People Argue About Jesus
ERV	John	7	40	above .
ERV	John	7	41	Other people said , “ He is the Messiah. ” And others said , “ The Messiah will not come from Galilee .
ERV	John	7	42	The Scriptures say that the Messiah will come from the family of David . And they say that he will come from Bethlehem , the town where David lived. ”
ERV	John	7	43	So the people did not agree with each other about Jesus .
ERV	John	7	44	Some of the people wanted to arrest him . But no one tried to do it . The Jewish Leaders Refuse to Believe
ERV	John	7	45	The Temple police went back to the leading priests and the Pharisees . The priests and the Pharisees asked , “ Why didn ’ t you bring Jesus ? ”
ERV	John	7	46	The Temple police answered , “ We have never heard anyone say such amazing things ! ”
ERV	John	7	47	The Pharisees answered , “ So he has fooled you too !
ERV	John	7	48	You don ’ t see any of the leaders or any of us Pharisees believing in him , do you ?
ERV	John	7	49	But those people out there know nothing about the law . They are under God ’ s curse ! ”
ERV	John	7	50	But Nicodemus was there in that group . He was the one who had gone to see Jesus before . [ b ] He said ,
ERV	John	7	51	“ Our law will not let us judge anyone without first hearing them and finding out what they have done. ”
ERV	John	7	52	The Jewish leaders answered , “ You must be from Galilee too ! Study the Scriptures . You will find nothing about a prophet [ c ] coming from Galilee. ” A Woman Caught in Adultery
ERV	John	7	53	Then they all left and went home . Footnotes - John 7:40 Prophet They probably meant the prophet that God told Moses he would send . See Deut . 18:15-19 . - John 7:50 He was the one … before The story about Nicodemus going and talking to Jesus is in Jn . 3:1-21 . - John 7:52 a prophet Two early Greek copies have “ the Prophet , ” which would mean the “ prophet like Moses ” mentioned in Deut . 18:15 . In Acts 3:22 and 7:37 this is understood to be the Messiah , as in verse
ERV	John	8	8	Then Jesus stooped down again and wrote on the ground .
ERV	John	8	2	Early in the morning he went back to the Temple area . The people all came to him , and he sat and taught them .
ERV	John	8	3	The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought a woman they had caught in bed with a man who was not her husband . They forced her to stand in front of the people .
ERV	John	8	4	They said to Jesus , “ Teacher , this woman was caught in the act of adultery .
ERV	John	8	5	The Law of Moses commands us to stone to death any such woman . What do you say we should do ? ”
ERV	John	8	6	They were saying this to trick Jesus . They wanted to catch him saying something wrong so that they could have a charge against him . But Jesus stooped down and started writing on the ground with his finger .
ERV	John	8	7	The Jewish leaders continued to ask him their question . So he stood up and said , “ Anyone here who has never sinned should throw the first stone at her. ”
ERV	John	8	9	When they heard this , they began to leave one by one . The older men left first , and then the others . Jesus was left alone with the woman standing there in front of him .
ERV	John	8	10	He looked up again and said to her , “ Where did they all go ? Did no one judge you guilty ? ”
ERV	John	8	11	She answered , “ No one , sir. ” Then Jesus said , “ I don ’ t judge you either . You can go now , but don ’ t sin again. ” [ a ] Jesus Is the Light of the World
ERV	John	8	12	Later , Jesus talked to the people again . He said , “ I am the light of the world . Whoever follows me will never live in darkness . They will have the light that gives life. ”
ERV	John	8	13	But the Pharisees said to Jesus , “ When you talk about yourself , you are the only one to say that these things are true . So we can not accept what you say. ”
ERV	John	8	14	Jesus answered , “ Yes , I am saying these things about myself . But people can believe what I say , because I know where I came from . And I know where I am going . But you don ’ t know where I came from or where I am going .
ERV	John	8	15	You judge me the way people judge other people . I don ’ t judge anyone .
ERV	John	8	16	But if I judge , my judging is true , because when I judge I am not alone . The Father who sent me is with me .
ERV	John	8	17	Your own law says that when two witnesses say the same thing , you must accept what they say .
ERV	John	8	18	I am one of the witnesses who speaks about myself . And the Father who sent me is my other witness. ”
ERV	John	8	19	The people asked , “ Where is your father ? ” Jesus answered , “ You don ’ t know me or my Father . But if you knew me , you would know my Father too. ”
ERV	John	8	20	Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the Temple area , near the room where the Temple offerings were kept . But no one arrested him , because the right time for him had not yet come . Some Jews Don ’ t Understand Jesus
ERV	John	8	21	Again , Jesus said to the people , “ I will leave you . You will look for me , but you will die in your sin . You can not come where I am going. ”
ERV	John	8	22	So the Jewish leaders asked themselves , “ Will he kill himself ? Is that why he said , ‘ You can not come where I am going ’ ? ”
ERV	John	8	23	But Jesus said to them , “ You people are from here below , but I am from above . You belong to this world , but I don ’ t belong to this world .
ERV	John	8	24	I told you that you would die in your sins . Yes , if you don ’ t believe that I Am , [ b ] you will die in your sins. ”
ERV	John	8	25	They asked , “ Then who are you ? ” Jesus answered , “ I am what I have told you from the beginning .
ERV	John	8	26	I have much more I could say to judge you . But I tell people only what I have heard from the one who sent me , and he speaks the truth. ”
ERV	John	8	27	They did not understand who he was talking about . He was telling them about the Father .
ERV	John	8	28	,
ERV	John	8	29	The one who sent me is with me . I always do what pleases him . So he has not left me alone. ”
ERV	John	8	30	While he was saying these things , many people believed in him . Jesus Talks About Freedom From Sin
ERV	John	8	31	So Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him , “ If you continue to accept and obey my teaching , you are really my followers .
ERV	John	8	32	You will know the truth , and the truth will make you free. ”
ERV	John	8	33	They answered , “ We are Abraham ’ s descendants . And we have never been slaves . So why do you say that we will be free ? ”
ERV	John	8	34	Jesus said , “ The truth is , everyone who sins is a slave—a slave to sin .
ERV	John	8	35	A slave does not stay with a family forever . But a son belongs to the family forever .
ERV	John	8	36	So if the Son makes you free , you are really free .
ERV	John	8	37	I know you are Abraham ’ s descendants . But you want to kill me , because you don ’ t want to accept my teaching .
ERV	John	8	38	I am telling you what my Father has shown me . But you do what your father has told you. ”
ERV	John	8	39	They said , “ Our father is Abraham. ” Jesus said , “ If you were really Abraham ’ s descendants , you would do what Abraham did .
ERV	John	8	40	I am someone who has told you the truth I heard from God . But you are trying to kill me . Abraham did nothing like that .
ERV	John	8	41	So you are doing what your own father did. ” But they said , “ We are not like children who never knew who their father was . God is our Father . He is the only Father we have. ”
ERV	John	8	42	Jesus said to them , “ If God were really your Father , you would love me . I came from God , and now I am here . I did not come by my own authority . God sent me .
ERV	John	8	43	You don ’ t understand the things I say , because you can not accept my teaching .
ERV	John	8	44	Your father is the devil . You belong to him . You want to do what he wants . He was a murderer from the beginning . He was always against the truth . There is no truth in him . He is like the lies he tells . Yes , the devil is a liar . He is the father of lies .
ERV	John	8	45	“ I am telling you the truth , and that ’ s why you don ’ t believe me .
ERV	John	8	46	Can any of you prove that I am guilty of sin ? If I tell the truth , why don ’ t you believe me ?
ERV	John	8	47	Whoever belongs to God accepts what he says . But you don ’ t accept what God says , because you don ’ t belong to God. ” Jesus Talks About Himself and Abraham
ERV	John	8	48	The Jews there answered , “ We say you are a Samaritan . We say a demon is making you crazy ! Are we not right when we say this ? ”
ERV	John	8	49	Jesus answered , “ I have no demon in me . I give honor to my Father , but you give no honor to me .
ERV	John	8	50	years old ! ”
ERV	John	8	51	I promise you , whoever continues to obey my teaching will never die. ”
ERV	John	8	52	The Jews said to Jesus , “ Now we know that you have a demon in you ! Even Abraham and the prophets died . But you say , ‘ Whoever obeys my teaching will never die. ’
ERV	John	8	53	Do you think you are greater than our father Abraham ? He died , and so did the prophets . Who do you think you are ? ”
ERV	John	8	54	Jesus answered , “ If I give honor to myself , that honor is worth nothing . The one who gives me honor is my Father . And you say that he is your God .
ERV	John	8	55	But you don ’ t really know him . I know him . If I said I did not know him , I would be a liar like you . But I do know him , and I obey what he says .
ERV	John	8	56	Your father Abraham was very happy that he would see the day when I came . He saw that day and was happy. ”
ERV	John	8	57	The Jews said to Jesus , “ What ? How can you say you have seen Abraham ? You are not even
ERV	John	8	58	. - John 8:28 lift up Meaning to be nailed to a cross and “ lifted up ” on it to die . It may also have a second meaning : to be “ lifted up ” from death to heaven .
ERV	John	8	59	When he said this , they picked up stones to throw at him . But Jesus hid , and then he left the Temple area . Footnotes - John 8:11 The oldest and best Greek copies do not have verses 7:53–8:11 . Other copies have this section in different places . - John 8:24 I Am This is like the name of God used in the Old Testament . See Isa . 41:4 ; 43:10 ; Ex . 3:14 . However , it can also mean “ I am he , ” meaning “ I am the Messiah. ” Also in verses
ERV	John	9	9	Some people said , “ Yes ! He is the one. ” But others said , “ No , he can ’ t be the same man . He only looks like him. ” So the man himself said , “ I am that same man. ”
ERV	John	9	2	Jesus ’ followers asked him , “ Teacher , why was this man born blind ? Whose sin made it happen ? Was it his own sin or that of his parents ? ”
ERV	John	9	3	Jesus answered , “ It was not any sin of this man or his parents that caused him to be blind . He was born blind so that he could be used to show what great things God can do .
ERV	John	9	4	While it is daytime , we must continue doing the work of the one who sent me . The night is coming , and no one can work at night .
ERV	John	9	5	While I am in the world , I am the light of the world. ”
ERV	John	9	6	After Jesus said this , he spit on the dirt , made some mud and put it on the man ’ s eyes .
ERV	John	9	7	Jesus told him , “ Go and wash in Siloam pool. ” ( Siloam means “ Sent. ” ) So the man went to the pool , washed and came back . He was now able to see .
ERV	John	9	8	His neighbors and some others who had seen him begging said , “ Look ! Is this the same man who always sits and begs ? ”
ERV	John	9	10	They asked , “ What happened ? How did you get your sight ? ”
ERV	John	9	11	He answered , “ The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes . Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash . So I went there and washed . And then I could see. ”
ERV	John	9	12	They asked him , “ Where is this man ? ” He answered , “ I don ’ t know. ” Some Pharisees Have Questions
ERV	John	9	13	Then the people brought the man to the Pharisees .
ERV	John	9	14	The day Jesus had made mud and healed the man ’ s eyes was a Sabbath day .
ERV	John	9	15	So the Pharisees asked the man , “ How did you get your sight ? ” He answered , “ He put mud on my eyes . I washed , and now I can see. ”
ERV	John	9	16	Some of the Pharisees said , “ That man does not obey the law about the Sabbath day . So he is not from God. ” Others said , “ But someone who is a sinner can not do these miraculous signs. ” So they could not agree with each other .
ERV	John	9	17	They asked the man again , “ Since it was your eyes he healed , what do you say about him ? ” He answered , “ He is a prophet. ”
ERV	John	9	18	The Jewish leaders still did not believe that this really happened to the man—that he was blind and was now healed . But later they sent for his parents .
ERV	John	9	19	They asked them , “ Is this your son ? You say he was born blind . So how can he see ? ”
ERV	John	9	20	His parents answered , “ We know that this man is our son . And we know that he was born blind .
ERV	John	9	21	But we don ’ t know why he can see now . We don ’ t know who healed his eyes . Ask him . He is old enough to answer for himself. ”
ERV	John	9	22	They said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders . The leaders had already decided that they would punish anyone who said Jesus was the Messiah . They would stop them from coming to the synagogue .
ERV	John	9	23	That is why his parents said , “ He is old enough . Ask him. ”
ERV	John	9	24	So the Jewish leaders called the man who had been blind . They told him to come in again . They said , “ You should honor God by telling the truth . We know that this man is a sinner. ”
ERV	John	9	25	The man answered , “ I don ’ t know if he is a sinner . But I do know this : I was blind , and now I can see. ”
ERV	John	9	26	They asked , “ What did he do to you ? How did he heal your eyes ? ”
ERV	John	9	27	He answered , “ I have already told you that . But you would not listen to me . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you want to be his followers too ? ”
ERV	John	9	28	At this they shouted insults at him and said , “ You are his follower , not us ! We are followers of Moses .
ERV	John	9	29	We know that God spoke to Moses . But we don ’ t even know where this man comes from ! ”
ERV	John	9	30	The man answered , “ This is really strange ! You don ’ t know where he comes from , but he healed my eyes .
ERV	John	9	31	We all know that God does not listen to sinners , but he will listen to anyone who worships and obeys him .
ERV	John	9	32	This is the first time we have ever heard of anyone healing the eyes of someone born blind .
ERV	John	9	33	This man must be from God . If he were not from God , he could not do anything like this. ”
ERV	John	9	34	The Jewish leaders answered , “ You were born full of sin ! Are you trying to teach us ? ” And they told the man to get out of the synagogue and to stay out . Spiritual Blindness
ERV	John	9	35	When Jesus heard that they had forced the man to leave , he found him and asked him , “ Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ”
ERV	John	9	36	The man said , “ Tell me who he is , sir , so I can believe in him. ”
ERV	John	9	37	Jesus said to him , “ You have already seen him . The Son of Man is the one talking with you now. ”
ERV	John	9	38	The man answered , “ Yes , I believe , Lord ! ” Then he bowed and worshiped Jesus .
ERV	John	9	39	Jesus said , “ I came into this world so that the world could be judged . I came so that people who are blind [ a ] could see . And I came so that people who think they see would become blind. ”
ERV	John	9	40	Some of the Pharisees were near Jesus . They heard him say this . They asked , “ What ? Are you saying that we are blind too ? ”
ERV	John	9	41	Jesus said , “ If you were really blind , you would not be guilty of sin . But you say that you see , so you are still guilty. ” Footnotes - John 9:39 people who are blind Jesus is talking about people who are spiritually blind ( without understanding ) , not physically blind .
ERV	John	10	10	A thief comes to steal , kill , and destroy . But I came to give life—life that is full and good .
ERV	John	10	2	But the man who takes care of the sheep enters through the gate . He is the shepherd .
ERV	John	10	3	The man who guards the gate opens the gate for the shepherd . And the sheep listen to the voice of the shepherd . He calls his own sheep , using their names , and he leads them out .
ERV	John	10	4	He brings all of his sheep out . Then he goes ahead of them and leads them . The sheep follow him , because they know his voice .
ERV	John	10	5	But sheep will never follow someone they don ’ t know . They will run away from him , because they don ’ t know his voice. ”
ERV	John	10	6	Jesus told the people this story , but they did not understand what it meant . Jesus Is the Good Shepherd
ERV	John	10	7	So Jesus said again , “ I assure you , I am the gate for the sheep .
ERV	John	10	8	All those who came before me were thieves and robbers . The sheep did not listen to them .
ERV	John	10	9	I am the gate . Whoever enters through me will be saved . They will be able to come in and go out . They will find everything they need .
ERV	John	10	11	“ I am the good shepherd , and the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep .
ERV	John	10	12	The worker who is paid to keep the sheep is different from the shepherd . The paid worker does not own the sheep . So when he sees a wolf coming , he runs away and leaves the sheep alone . Then the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them .
ERV	John	10	13	The man runs away because he is only a paid worker . He does not really care for the sheep . 14-15 “ I am the shepherd who cares for the sheep . I know my sheep just as the Father knows me . And my sheep know me just as I know the Father . I give my life for these sheep .
ERV	John	10	16	I have other sheep too . They are not in this flock here . I must lead them also . They will listen to my voice . In the future there will be one flock and one shepherd . [ a ]
ERV	John	10	17	The Father loves me because I give my life . I give my life so that I can get it back again .
ERV	John	10	18	No one takes my life away from me . I give my own life freely . I have the right to give my life , and I have the right to get it back again . This is what the Father told me. ”
ERV	John	10	19	Again the Jews were divided over what Jesus was saying .
ERV	John	10	20	Many of them said , “ A demon has come into him and made him crazy . Why listen to him ? ”
ERV	John	10	21	But others said , “ These aren ’ t the words of someone controlled by a demon . A demon can not heal the eyes of a blind man. ” The Jewish Leaders Against Jesus
ERV	John	10	22	It was winter , and the time came for the Festival of Dedication [ b ] at Jerusalem .
ERV	John	10	23	Jesus was in the Temple area at Solomon ’ s Porch .
ERV	John	10	24	The Jewish leaders gathered around him . They said , “ How long will you make us wonder about you ? If you are the Messiah , then tell us clearly. ”
ERV	John	10	25	Jesus answered , “ I told you already , but you did not believe . I do miracles in my Father ’ s name . These miracles show who I am .
ERV	John	10	26	But you do not believe , because you are not my sheep .
ERV	John	10	27	My sheep listen to my voice . I know them , and they follow me .
ERV	John	10	28	I give my sheep eternal life . They will never die , and no one can take them out of my hand .
ERV	John	10	29	My Father is the one who gave them to me , and he is greater than all . [ c ] No one can steal my sheep out of his hand .
ERV	John	10	30	The Father and I are one. ”
ERV	John	10	31	Again the Jews there picked up stones to kill Jesus .
ERV	John	10	32	But he said to them , “ The many wonderful things you have seen me do are from the Father . Which of these good things are you killing me for ? ”
ERV	John	10	33	They answered , “ We are not killing you for any good thing you did . But you say things that insult God . You are only a man , but you say you are the same as God ! That is why we are trying to kill you ! ”
ERV	John	10	34	Jesus answered , “ It is written in your law that God said , ‘ I said you are gods. ’ [ d ]
ERV	John	10	35	This Scripture called those people gods—the people who received God ’ s message . And Scripture is always true .
ERV	John	10	36	So why do you accuse me of insulting God for saying , ‘ I am God ’ s Son ’ ? I am the one God chose and sent into the world .
ERV	John	10	37	If I don ’ t do what my Father does , then don ’ t believe what I say .
ERV	John	10	38	But if I do what my Father does , you should believe in what I do . You might not believe in me , but you should believe in the things I do . Then you will know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father. ”
ERV	John	10	39	They tried to get Jesus again , but he escaped from them .
ERV	John	10	40	Then he went back across the Jordan River to the place where John began his work of baptizing people . Jesus stayed there ,
ERV	John	10	41	and many people came to him . They said , “ John never did any miraculous signs , but everything John said about this man is true. ”
ERV	John	10	42	And many people there believed in Jesus . Footnotes - John 10:16 I have other sheep … shepherd Jesus means he has followers who are not Jews . See Jn . 11:52 . - John 10:22 Festival of Dedication Hanukkah , or “ Festival of Lights , ” a special week in December celebrating the time in

ERV	John	11	11	Then Jesus said , “ Our friend Lazarus is now sleeping , but I am going there to wake him. ”
ERV	John	11	2	( Mary is the same woman who put perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair . ) Mary ’ s brother was Lazarus , the man who was now sick .
ERV	John	11	3	km .
ERV	John	11	4	When Jesus heard this he said , “ The end of this sickness will not be death . No , this sickness is for the glory of God . This has happened to bring glory to the Son of God. ”
ERV	John	11	5	Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
ERV	John	11	6	So when he heard that Lazarus was sick , he stayed where he was two more days
ERV	John	11	7	and then said to his followers , “ We should go back to Judea. ”
ERV	John	11	8	They answered , “ But Teacher , those Jews there tried to stone you to death . That was only a short time ago . Now you want to go back there ? ”
ERV	John	11	9	Jesus answered , “ There are twelve hours of light in the day . Whoever walks in the day will not stumble and fall because they can see with the light from the sun . [ a ]
ERV	John	11	10	But whoever walks at night will stumble because there is no light. ”
ERV	John	11	12	The followers answered , “ But , Lord , if he can sleep , he will get well. ”
ERV	John	11	13	They thought Jesus meant that Lazarus was literally sleeping , but he really meant that Lazarus was dead .
ERV	John	11	14	So then Jesus said plainly , “ Lazarus is dead .
ERV	John	11	15	stadia , ” almost
ERV	John	11	16	Then Thomas , the one called “ Twin , ” said to the other followers , “ We will go too . We will die there with Jesus. ” Jesus in Bethany
ERV	John	11	17	Jesus arrived in Bethany and found that Lazarus had already been dead and in the tomb for four days .
ERV	John	11	18	Bethany was about two miles [ b ] from Jerusalem .
ERV	John	11	19	Many Jews had come to see Martha and Mary . They came to comfort them about their brother Lazarus .
ERV	John	11	20	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went out to greet him . But Mary stayed home .
ERV	John	11	21	Martha said to Jesus , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
ERV	John	11	22	But I know that even now God will give you anything you ask. ”
ERV	John	11	23	Jesus said , “ Your brother will rise and be alive again. ”
ERV	John	11	24	Martha answered , “ I know that he will rise to live again at the time of the resurrection on the last day. ”
ERV	John	11	25	Jesus said to her , “ I am the resurrection . I am life . Everyone who believes in me will have life , even if they die .
ERV	John	11	26	And everyone who lives and believes in me will never really die . Martha , do you believe this ? ”
ERV	John	11	27	Martha answered , “ Yes , Lord . I believe that you are the Messiah , the Son of God . You are the one who was coming to the world. ” Jesus Cries
ERV	John	11	28	After Martha said these things , she went back to her sister Mary . She talked to Mary alone and said , “ The Teacher is here . He is asking for you. ”
ERV	John	11	29	When Mary heard this , she stood up and went quickly to Jesus .
ERV	John	11	30	He had not yet come into the village . He was still at the place where Martha met him .
ERV	John	11	31	The Jews who were in the house comforting Mary saw her get up and leave quickly . They thought she was going to the tomb to cry there . So they followed her .
ERV	John	11	32	Mary went to the place where Jesus was . When she saw him , she bowed at his feet and said , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died. ”
ERV	John	11	33	When Jesus saw Mary crying and the people with her crying too , he was very upset and deeply troubled .
ERV	John	11	34	He asked , “ Where did you put him ? ” They said , “ Lord , come and see. ”
ERV	John	11	35	Jesus cried .
ERV	John	11	36	And the Jews said , “ Look ! He loved Lazarus very much ! ”
ERV	John	11	37	But some of them said , “ Jesus healed the eyes of the blind man . Why didn ’ t he help Lazarus and stop him from dying ? ” Jesus Raises Lazarus From Death
ERV	John	11	38	Again feeling very upset , Jesus came to the tomb . It was a cave with a large stone covering the entrance .
ERV	John	11	39	He said , “ Move the stone away. ” Martha said , “ But , Lord , it has been four days since Lazarus died . There will be a bad smell. ” Martha was the sister of the dead man .
ERV	John	11	40	Then Jesus said to her , “ Remember what I told you ? I said that if you believed , you would see God ’ s divine greatness. ”
ERV	John	11	41	So they moved the stone away from the entrance . Then Jesus looked up and said , “ Father , I thank you that you heard me .
ERV	John	11	42	I know that you always hear me . But I said these things because of the people here around me . I want them to believe that you sent me. ”
ERV	John	11	43	After Jesus said this he called in a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come out ! ”
ERV	John	11	44	The dead man came out . His hands and feet were wrapped with pieces of cloth . He had a handkerchief covering his face . Jesus said to the people , “ Take off the cloth and let him go. ” The Jewish Leaders Plan to Kill Jesus ( A )
ERV	John	11	45	There were many Jews who came to visit Mary . When they saw what Jesus did , many of them believed in him .
ERV	John	11	46	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus did .
ERV	John	11	47	Then the leading priests and Pharisees called a meeting of the high council . They said , “ What should we do ? This man is doing many miraculous signs .
ERV	John	11	48	If we let him continue doing these things , everyone will believe in him . Then the Romans will come and take away our Temple and our nation. ”
ERV	John	11	49	One of the men there was Caiaphas . He was the high priest that year . He said , “ You people know nothing !
ERV	John	11	50	It is better for one man to die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed . But you don ’ t realize this. ”
ERV	John	11	51	Caiaphas did not think of this himself . As that year ’ s high priest , he was really prophesying that Jesus would die for the Jewish people .
ERV	John	11	52	Yes , he would die for the Jewish people . But he would also die for God ’ s other children scattered all over the world . He would die to bring them all together and make them one people .
ERV	John	11	53	That day the Jewish leaders began planning to kill Jesus .
ERV	John	11	54	So Jesus stopped traveling around openly among the Jews . He went away to a town called Ephraim in an area near the desert . He stayed there with his followers .
ERV	John	11	55	It was almost time for the Jewish Passover festival . Many people from the country went to Jerusalem before the Passover . They went to do the special things to make themselves pure for the festival .
ERV	John	11	56	The people looked for Jesus . They stood in the Temple area and asked each other , “ Is he coming to the festival ? What do you think ? ”
ERV	John	11	57	But the leading priests and the Pharisees had given a special order about Jesus . They said that anyone who knew where he was must tell them so that they could arrest him . Footnotes - John 11:9 from the sun Literally , “ of this world. ” - John 11:18 two miles Literally , “
ERV	John	12	12	The next day the people in Jerusalem heard that Jesus was coming there . These were the crowds of people who had come to the Passover festival .
ERV	John	12	2	There they had a dinner for Jesus . Martha served the food , and Lazarus was one of the people eating with Jesus .
ERV	John	12	3	Mary brought in a pint [ a ] of expensive perfume made of pure nard . She poured the perfume on Jesus ’ feet . Then she wiped his feet with her hair . And the sweet smell from the perfume filled the whole house .
ERV	John	12	4	Judas Iscariot , one of Jesus ’ followers , was there—the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies . Judas said ,
ERV	John	12	5	“ That perfume was worth a full year ’ s pay . [ b ] It should have been sold , and the money should have been given to the poor people. ”
ERV	John	12	6	But Judas did not really care about the poor . He said this because he was a thief . He was the one who kept the moneybag for the group of followers . And he often stole money from the bag .
ERV	John	12	7	Jesus answered , “ Don ’ t stop her . It was right for her to save this perfume for today—the day for me to be prepared for burial .
ERV	John	12	8	You will always have those who are poor with you . [ c ] But you will not always have me. ” The Plot Against Lazarus
ERV	John	12	9	Many of the Jews heard that Jesus was in Bethany , so they went there to see him . They also went there to see Lazarus , the one Jesus raised from death .
ERV	John	12	10	So the leading priests made plans to kill Lazarus too .
ERV	John	12	11	Because of him , many Jews were leaving them and believing in Jesus . That is why they wanted to kill Lazarus too . Jesus Enters Jerusalem Like a King ( B )
ERV	John	12	13	They took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Jesus . They shouted , God bless the King of Israel ! ”
ERV	John	12	14	Jesus found a donkey and rode on it , as the Scriptures say ,
ERV	John	12	15	“ Do not be afraid , people of Zion [ e ] ! Look ! Your king is coming . He is riding on a young donkey. ” ( D )
ERV	John	12	16	The followers of Jesus did not understand at that time what was happening . But after he was raised to glory , they understood that this was written about him . Then they remembered that they had done these things for him .
ERV	John	12	17	There were many people with Jesus when he raised Lazarus from death and told him to come out of the tomb . Now they were telling others about what Jesus did .
ERV	John	12	18	That ’ s why so many people went out to meet him—because they had heard about this miraculous sign he did .
ERV	John	12	19	So the Pharisees said to each other , “ Look ! Our plan is not working . The people are all following him ! ” Jesus Talks About Life and Death
ERV	John	12	20	There were some Greeks there too . These were some of the people who went to Jerusalem to worship at the Passover festival .
ERV	John	12	21	They went to Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee . They said , “ Sir , we want to meet Jesus. ”
ERV	John	12	22	Philip went and told Andrew . Then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus .
ERV	John	12	23	Jesus said to them , “ The time has come for the Son of Man to receive his glory .
ERV	John	12	24	It is a fact that a grain of wheat must fall to the ground and die before it can grow and produce much more wheat . If it never dies , it will never be more than a single seed .
ERV	John	12	25	Whoever loves the life they have now will lose it . But whoever is willing to give up their life in this world will keep it . They will have eternal life .
ERV	John	12	26	Whoever serves me must follow me . My servants must be with me everywhere I am . My Father will give honor to anyone who serves me . Jesus Talks About His Death
ERV	John	12	27	“ Now I am very troubled . What should I say ? Should I say , ‘ Father save me from this time of suffering ’ ? No , I came to this time so that I could suffer .
ERV	John	12	28	Father , do what will bring you glory ! ” Then a voice came from heaven , “ I have already brought glory to myself . I will do it again. ”
ERV	John	12	29	The people standing there heard the voice . They said it was thunder . But others said , “ An angel spoke to him ! ”
ERV	John	12	30	Jesus said , “ That voice was for you and not for me .
ERV	John	12	31	Now is the time for the world to be judged . Now the ruler of this world will be thrown out .
ERV	John	12	32	I will be lifted up [ f ] from the earth . When that happens , I will draw all people to myself. ”
ERV	John	12	33	Jesus said this to show how he would die .
ERV	John	12	34	. - John 12:35 light This means Christ , as in Jn . 1:5-9 . Also , it is a symbol of goodness and truth , qualities associated with Christ and his kingdom .
ERV	John	12	35	Then Jesus said , “ The light [ g ] will be with you for only a short time more . So walk while you have the light . Then the darkness will not catch you . People who walk in the darkness don ’ t know where they are going .
ERV	John	12	36	So put your trust in the light while you still have it . Then you will be children of light. ” When Jesus finished saying these things , he went away to a place where the people could not find him . Some Jews Refuse to Believe in Jesus
ERV	John	12	37	The people saw all these miraculous signs Jesus did , but they still did not believe in him .
ERV	John	12	38	This was to give full meaning to what Isaiah the prophet said : “ Lord , who believed what we told them ? Who has seen the Lord ’ s power ? ” ( E )
ERV	John	12	39	This is why the people could not believe . Because Isaiah also said ,
ERV	John	12	40	“ God made the people blind . He closed their minds . He did this so that they would not see with their eyes and understand with their minds . He did it so that they would not turn and be healed. ” ( F )
ERV	John	12	41	Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus ’ divine greatness . So he spoke about him .
ERV	John	12	42	But many people believed in Jesus . Even many of the Jewish leaders believed in him , but they were afraid of the Pharisees , so they did not say openly that they believed . They were afraid they would be ordered to stay out of the synagogue .
ERV	John	12	43	They loved praise from people more than praise from God . Jesus ’ Teaching Will Judge People
ERV	John	12	44	Then Jesus said loudly , “ Everyone who believes in me is really believing in the one who sent me .
ERV	John	12	45	Everyone who sees me is really seeing the one who sent me .
ERV	John	12	46	I came into this world as a light . I came so that everyone who believes in me will not stay in darkness .
ERV	John	12	47	“ I did not come into the world to judge people . I came to save the people in the world . So I am not the one who judges those who hear my teaching and do not obey .
ERV	John	12	48	But there is a judge for all those who refuse to believe in me and do not accept what I say . The message I have spoken will judge them on the last day .
ERV	John	12	49	That is because what I taught was not from myself . The Father who sent me told me what to say and what to teach .
ERV	John	12	50	And I know that whatever he says to do will bring eternal life . So the things I say are exactly what the Father told me to say. ” Footnotes - John 12:3 pint Literally , “ litra , ” a Roman pound , equal to

ERV	John	13	2	Jesus and his followers were at the evening meal . The devil had already persuaded Judas Iscariot to hand Jesus over to his enemies . ( Judas was the son of Simon . )
ERV	John	13	3	The Father had given Jesus power over everything . Jesus knew this . He also knew that he had come from God . And he knew that he was going back to God .
ERV	John	13	4	So while they were eating , Jesus stood up and took off his robe . He got a towel and wrapped it around his waist .
ERV	John	13	5	Then he poured water into a bowl and began to wash the followers ’ feet . [ a ] He dried their feet with the towel that was wrapped around his waist .
ERV	John	13	6	He came to Simon Peter . But Peter said to him , “ Lord , you should not wash my feet. ”
ERV	John	13	7	Jesus answered , “ You don ’ t know what I am doing now . But later you will understand. ”
ERV	John	13	8	Peter said , “ No ! You will never wash my feet. ” Jesus answered , “ If I don ’ t wash your feet , you are not one of my people. ”
ERV	John	13	9	Simon Peter said , “ Lord , after you wash my feet , wash my hands and my head too ! ”
ERV	John	13	10	Jesus said , “ After a person has a bath , his whole body is clean . He needs only to wash his feet . And you are clean , but not all of you. ”
ERV	John	13	11	Jesus knew who would hand him over to his enemies . That is why he said , “ Not all of you are clean. ”
ERV	John	13	12	When Jesus finished washing their feet , he put on his clothes and went back to the table . He asked , “ Do you understand what I did for you ?
ERV	John	13	14	I am your Lord and Teacher . But I washed your feet . So you also should wash each other ’ s feet .
ERV	John	13	15	I did this as an example for you . So you should serve each other just as I served you .
ERV	John	13	16	Believe me , servants are not greater than their master . Those who are sent to do something are not greater than the one who sent them .

ERV	John	13	18	“ I am not talking about all of you . I know the people I have chosen . But what the Scriptures say must happen : ‘ The man who shared my food has turned against me. ’ [ b ]
ERV	John	13	19	I am telling you this now before it happens . Then when it happens , you will believe that I Am . [ c ]
ERV	John	13	20	I assure you , whoever accepts the person I send also accepts me . And whoever accepts me also accepts the one who sent me. ” Jesus Tells Who Will Turn Against Him ( A )
ERV	John	13	21	After Jesus said these things , he felt very troubled . He said openly , “ Believe me when I say that one of you will hand me over to my enemies. ”
ERV	John	13	22	His followers all looked at each other . They did not understand who Jesus was talking about .
ERV	John	13	23	One of the followers was next to Jesus and was leaning close to him . This was the one Jesus loved very much .
ERV	John	13	24	Simon Peter made signs to this follower to ask Jesus who he was talking about .
ERV	John	13	25	That follower leaned closer to Jesus and asked , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
ERV	John	13	26	Jesus answered him , “ I will dip this bread into the dish . The man I give it to is the one. ” So Jesus took a piece of bread , dipped it , and gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon .
ERV	John	13	27	When Judas took the bread , Satan entered him . Jesus said to Judas , “ What you will do—do it quickly ! ”

ERV	John	19	11	Jesus answered , “ The only power you have over me is the power given to you by God . So the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin. ”
ERV	John	19	12	After this , Pilate tried to let Jesus go free . But the Jewish leaders shouted , “ Anyone who makes himself a king is against Caesar . So if you let this man go free , that means you are not Caesar ’ s friend. ”
ERV	John	19	13	When Pilate heard this , he brought Jesus out to the place called “ The Stone Pavement. ” ( In Aramaic the name is Gabbatha . ) Pilate sat down on the judge ’ s seat there .
ERV	John	19	14	It was now almost noon on Preparation day of Passover week . Pilate said to the Jews , “ Here is your king ! ”
ERV	John	19	15	They shouted , “ Take him away ! Take him away ! Kill him on a cross ! ” Pilate asked them , “ Do you want me to kill your king on a cross ? ” The leading priests answered , “ The only king we have is Caesar ! ”
ERV	John	19	16	So Pilate handed Jesus over to them to be killed on a cross . Jesus Is Nailed to a Cross ( A ) The soldiers took Jesus .
ERV	John	19	17	He carried his own cross to a place called “ The Place of the Skull. ” ( In Aramaic the name of this place is “ Golgotha. ” )
ERV	John	19	18	There they nailed Jesus to the cross . They also nailed two other men to crosses . They put them on each side of Jesus with him in the middle .
ERV	John	19	20	The sign was written in Aramaic , in Latin , and in Greek . Many of the Jews read this sign , because the place where Jesus was nailed to the cross was near the city .
ERV	John	19	21	The leading Jewish priests said to Pilate , “ Don ’ t write , ‘ The King of the Jews. ’ But write , ‘ This man said , I am the King of the Jews. ’ ”
ERV	John	19	22	Pilate answered , “ I will not change what I have written. ”
ERV	John	19	23	After the soldiers nailed Jesus to the cross , they took his clothes and divided them into four parts . Each soldier got one part . They also took his tunic . It was all one piece of cloth woven from top to bottom .
ERV	John	19	24	So the soldiers said to each other , “ We should not tear this into parts . Let ’ s throw lots to see who will get it. ” This happened to make clear the full meaning of what the Scriptures say : “ They divided my clothes among them , and they threw lots for what I was wearing. ” ( B ) So the soldiers did this .
ERV	John	19	25	Jesus ’ mother stood near his cross . Her sister was also standing there with Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
ERV	John	19	26	Jesus saw his mother . He also saw the follower he loved very much standing there . He said to his mother , “ Dear woman , here is your son. ”
ERV	John	19	27	Then he said to the follower , “ Here is your mother. ” So after that , this follower took Jesus ’ mother to live in his home . Jesus Dies ( C )
ERV	John	19	28	Later , Jesus knew that everything had been done . To make the Scriptures come true he said , “ I am thirsty. ” [ a ]
ERV	John	19	29	There was a jar full of sour wine there , so the soldiers soaked a sponge in it . They put the sponge on a branch of a hyssop plant and lifted it to Jesus ’ mouth .
ERV	John	19	30	When he tasted the wine , he said , “ It is finished. ” Then he bowed his head and died .
ERV	John	19	31	This day was Preparation day . The next day was a special Sabbath day . The Jewish leaders did not want the bodies to stay on the cross on the Sabbath day . So they asked Pilate to order that the legs of the men be broken . And they asked that the bodies be taken down from the crosses .
ERV	John	19	32	So the soldiers came and broke the legs [ b ] of the two men on the crosses beside Jesus .
ERV	John	19	33	But when the soldiers came close to Jesus , they saw that he was already dead . So they did not break his legs .
ERV	John	19	34	But one of the soldiers stuck his spear into Jesus ’ side . Immediately blood and water came out .
ERV	John	19	35	( The one who saw this happen has told about it . He told about it so that you also can believe . The things he says are true . He knows that he tells the truth . )
ERV	John	19	36	These things happened to give full meaning to the Scriptures that said , “ None of his bones will be broken ” [ c ]
ERV	John	19	37	and “ People will look at the one they stabbed. ” [ d ] Jesus Is Buried ( D )
ERV	John	19	38	Later , a man named Joseph from Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus . ( Joseph was a follower of Jesus , but he did not tell anyone , because he was afraid of the Jewish leaders . ) Pilate said Joseph could take Jesus ’ body , so he came and took it away .
ERV	John	19	39	Nicodemus went with Joseph . He was the man who had come to Jesus before and talked to him at night . He brought about
ERV	John	19	100	litras ” ( Roman pounds ) , equal to 32.7 kg (
ERV	John	19	40	These two men took Jesus ’ body and wrapped it in pieces of linen cloth with the spices . ( This is how the Jews bury people . )
ERV	John	19	41	In the place where Jesus was killed on the cross , there was a garden . In the garden there was a new tomb . No one had ever been buried there before .
ERV	John	19	42	The men put Jesus in that tomb because it was near , and the Jews were preparing to start their Sabbath day .

ERV	John	20	20	As soon as he said this , he showed them his hands and his side . When the followers saw the Lord , they were very happy .
ERV	John	20	2	So she ran to Simon Peter and the other follower ( the one Jesus loved very much ) . She said , “ They have taken the Lord out of the tomb , and we don ’ t know where they put him. ”
ERV	John	20	3	So Peter and the other follower started going to the tomb .
ERV	John	20	4	They were both running , but the other follower ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first .
ERV	John	20	5	He bent down and looked in . He saw the pieces of linen cloth lying there , but he did not go in .
ERV	John	20	6	Then Simon Peter finally reached the tomb and went in . He saw the pieces of linen lying there .
ERV	John	20	7	He also saw the cloth that had been around Jesus ’ head . It was folded up and laid in a different place from the pieces of linen .
ERV	John	20	8	Then the other follower went in—the one who had reached the tomb first . He saw what had happened and believed .
ERV	John	20	9	( These followers did not yet understand from the Scriptures that Jesus must rise from death . ) Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene ( B )
ERV	John	20	10	Then the followers went back home .
ERV	John	20	11	But Mary stood outside the tomb , crying . While she was crying , she bent down and looked inside the tomb .
ERV	John	20	12	She saw two angels dressed in white sitting where Jesus ’ body had been . One was sitting where the head had been ; the other was sitting where the feet had been .
ERV	John	20	13	The angels asked Mary , “ Woman , why are you crying ? ” Mary answered , “ They took away the body of my Lord , and I don ’ t know where they put him. ”
ERV	John	20	14	When Mary said this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing there . But she did not know that it was Jesus .
ERV	John	20	15	He asked her , “ Woman , why are you crying ? Who are you looking for ? ” She thought he was the man in charge of the garden . So she said to him , “ Did you take him away , sir ? Tell me where you put him . I will go and get him. ”
ERV	John	20	16	Jesus said to her , “ Mary. ” She turned toward him and said in Aramaic , “ Rabboni , ” which means “ Teacher. ”
ERV	John	20	17	Jesus said to her , “ You don ’ t need to hold on to me ! I have not yet gone back up to the Father . But go to my followers [ a ] and tell them this : ‘ I am going back to my Father and your Father . I am going back to my God and your God. ’ ”
ERV	John	20	18	Mary Magdalene went to the followers and told them , “ I saw the Lord ! ” And she told them what he had said to her . Jesus Appears to His Followers ( C )
ERV	John	20	19	The day was Sunday , and that same evening the followers were together . They had the doors locked because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders . Suddenly , Jesus was standing there among them . He said , “ Peace be with you ! ”
ERV	John	20	21	Then Jesus said again , “ Peace be with you . It was the Father who sent me , and I am now sending you in the same way. ”
ERV	John	20	22	Then he breathed on them and said , “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
ERV	John	20	23	If you forgive the sins of anyone , their sins are forgiven . If there is anyone whose sins you don ’ t forgive , their sins are not forgiven. ” Jesus Appears to Thomas
ERV	John	20	24	Thomas ( called Didymus ) was one of the twelve , but he was not with the other followers when Jesus came .
ERV	John	20	25	They told him , “ We saw the Lord. ” Thomas said , “ That ’ s hard to believe . I will have to see the nail holes in his hands , put my finger where the nails were , and put my hand into his side . Only then will I believe it. ”
ERV	John	20	26	A week later the followers were in the house again , and Thomas was with them . The doors were locked , but Jesus came and stood among them . He said , “ Peace be with you ! ”
ERV	John	20	27	Then he said to Thomas , “ Put your finger here . Look at my hands . Put your hand here in my side . Stop doubting and believe. ”
ERV	John	20	28	Thomas said to Jesus , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
ERV	John	20	29	Jesus said to him , “ You believe because you see me . Great blessings belong to the people who believe without seeing me ! ” Why John Wrote This Book
ERV	John	20	30	Jesus did many other miraculous signs that his followers saw , which are not written in this book .
ERV	John	20	31	But these are written so that you can believe that Jesus is the Messiah , the Son of God . Then , by believing , you can have life through his name . Footnotes - John 20:17 followers Literally , “ brothers . ”
ERV	John	21	21	When Peter saw him behind them , he asked Jesus , “ Lord , what about him ? ”
ERV	John	21	2	Some of the followers were together—Simon Peter , Thomas ( called Didymus ) , Nathanael from Cana in Galilee , the two sons of Zebedee , and two other followers .
ERV	John	21	3	Simon Peter said , “ I am going out to fish. ” The other followers said , “ We will go with you. ” So all of them went out and got into the boat . They fished that night but caught nothing .
ERV	John	21	4	Early the next morning Jesus stood on the shore . But the followers did not know it was Jesus .
ERV	John	21	5	Then he said to them , “ Friends , have you caught any fish ? ” They answered , “ No. ”
ERV	John	21	6	He said , “ Throw your net into the water on the right side of your boat . You will find some fish there. ” So they did this . They caught so many fish that they could not pull the net back into the boat .
ERV	John	21	7	The follower Jesus loved very much said to Peter , “ That man is the Lord ! ” When Peter heard him say it was the Lord , he wrapped his coat around himself . ( He had taken his clothes off to work . ) Then he jumped into the water .
ERV	John	21	8	The other followers went to shore in the boat . They pulled the net full of fish . They were not very far from shore , only about
ERV	John	21	100	yards Literally , “
ERV	John	21	9	When they stepped out of the boat and onto the shore , they saw a fire of hot coals . There were fish on the fire and some bread there too .
ERV	John	21	10	.
ERV	John	21	11	Simon Peter got into the boat and pulled the net to the shore . It was full of big fish—153 of them ! But even with that many fish , the net did not tear .
ERV	John	21	12	Jesus said to them , “ Come and eat. ” None of the followers would ask him , “ Who are you ? ” They knew he was the Lord .
ERV	John	21	13	Jesus walked over to get the bread and gave it to them . He also gave them the fish .
ERV	John	21	14	This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his followers after he was raised from death . Jesus Talks to Peter
ERV	John	21	15	When they finished eating , Jesus said to Simon Peter , “ Simon , son of John , do you love me more than these other men love me ? ” Peter answered , “ Yes , Lord , you know that I love you. ” Then Jesus said to him , “ Take care of my lambs . [ c ] ”
ERV	John	21	16	and
ERV	John	21	17	to mean his followers , as in Jn .
ERV	John	21	18	The truth is , when you were young , you tied your own belt and went where you wanted . But when you are old , you will put out your hands , and someone else will tie your belt . They will lead you where you don ’ t want to go. ”
ERV	John	21	19	( Jesus said this to show how Peter would die to give glory to God . ) Then he said to Peter , “ Follow me ! ”
ERV	John	21	20	Peter turned and saw the follower Jesus loved very much walking behind them . ( This was the follower who had leaned against Jesus at the supper and said , “ Lord , who is it that will hand you over ? ” )
ERV	John	21	22	Jesus answered , “ Maybe I want him to live until I come . That should not matter to you . You follow me ! ”
ERV	John	21	23	So a story spread among the followers of Jesus . They were saying that this follower would not die . But Jesus did not say he would not die . He only said , “ Maybe I want him to live until I come . That should not matter to you. ”
ERV	John	21	24	That follower is the one who is telling these things . He is the one who has now written them all down . We know that what he says is true .
ERV	John	21	25	There are many other things that Jesus did . If every one of them were written down , I think the whole world would not be big enough for all the books that would be written .

ERV	Romans	1	1	Greetings from Paul , a servant of Christ Jesus . God chose me to be an apostle and gave me the work of telling his Good News .
ERV	Romans	1	2	God promised long ago through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures to give this Good News to his people . 3-4 The Good News is about God ’ s Son , Jesus Christ our Lord . As a human , he was born from the family of David , but through the Holy Spirit [ a ] he was shown to be God ’ s powerful Son when he was raised from death .
ERV	Romans	1	5	Through Christ , God gave me the special work of an apostle—to lead people of all nations to believe and obey him . I do all this to honor Christ .
ERV	Romans	1	6	You are some of those who have been chosen to belong to Jesus Christ .
ERV	Romans	1	7	This letter is to all of you in Rome . God loves you , and he has chosen you to be his holy people . Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ . A Prayer of Thanks
ERV	Romans	1	8	First I want to say that I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you . I thank him because people everywhere in the world are talking about your great faith . 9-10 Every time I pray , I always remember you . God knows this is true . He is the one I serve with all my heart by telling people the Good News about his Son . I pray that I will be allowed to come to you . It will happen if God wants it .
ERV	Romans	1	11	I want very much to see you and give you some spiritual gift to make your faith stronger .
ERV	Romans	1	12	I mean that I want us to help each other with the faith that we have . Your faith will help me , and my faith will help you .
ERV	Romans	1	13	Brothers and sisters , I want you to know that I have planned many times to come to you , but something always happens to change my plans . I would like to see the same good result among you that I have had from my work among the other non-Jewish people .
ERV	Romans	1	14	I must serve all people—those who share in Greek culture and those who are less civilized , [ b ] the educated as well as the ignorant .
ERV	Romans	1	15	That is why I want so much to tell the Good News to you there in Rome .
ERV	Romans	1	16	I am proud of the Good News , because it is the power God uses to save everyone who believes—to save the Jews first , and now to save those who are not Jews .
ERV	Romans	1	17	The Good News shows how God makes people right with himself . God ’ s way of making people right begins and ends with faith . As the Scriptures say , “ The one who is right with God by faith will live forever. ” [ c ] All People Have Done Wrong
ERV	Romans	1	18	God shows his anger from heaven against all the evil and wrong things that people do . Their evil lives hide the truth they have .
ERV	Romans	1	19	This makes God angry because they have been shown what he is like . Yes , God has made it clear to them .
ERV	Romans	1	20	There are things about God that people can not see—his eternal power and all that makes him God . But since the beginning of the world , those things have been easy for people to understand . They are made clear in what God has made . So people have no excuse for the evil they do .
ERV	Romans	1	21	People knew God , but they did not honor him as God , and they did not thank him . Their ideas were all useless . There was not one good thought left in their foolish minds .
ERV	Romans	1	22	They said they were wise , but they became fools .
ERV	Romans	1	23	Instead of honoring the divine greatness of God , who lives forever , they traded it for the worship of idols—things made to look like humans , who get sick and die , or like birds , animals , and snakes .
ERV	Romans	1	24	People wanted only to do evil . So God left them and let them go their sinful way . And so they became completely immoral and used their bodies in shameful ways with each other .
ERV	Romans	1	25	They traded the truth of God for a lie . They bowed down and worshiped the things God made instead of worshiping the God who made those things . He is the one who should be praised forever . Amen .
ERV	Romans	1	26	Because people did those things , God left them and let them do the shameful things they wanted to do . Women stopped having natural sex with men and started having sex with other women .
ERV	Romans	1	27	In the same way , men stopped having natural sex with women and began wanting each other all the time . Men did shameful things with other men , and in their bodies they received the punishment for those wrongs .
ERV	Romans	1	28	People did not think it was important to have a true knowledge of God . So God left them and allowed them to have their own worthless thinking . And so they do what they should not do .
ERV	Romans	1	29	They are filled with every kind of sin , evil , greed , and hatred . They are full of jealousy , murder , fighting , lying , and thinking the worst things about each other . They gossip
ERV	Romans	1	30	and say evil things about each other . They hate God . They are rude , proud , and brag about themselves . They invent ways of doing evil . They don ’ t obey their parents ,
ERV	Romans	1	31	they are foolish , they don ’ t keep their promises , and they show no kindness or mercy to others .
ERV	Romans	1	32	They know God ’ s law says that anyone who lives like that should die . But they not only continue to do these things themselves , but they also encourage others who do them . Footnotes - Romans 1:3 Holy Spirit Literally , “ spirit of holiness. ” - Romans 1:14 those who share … civilized Literally , “ Greeks and barbarians. ” See “ Greek ” in the Word List . - Romans 1:17 Quote from Hab . 2:4 .
ERV	Romans	2	2	God judges all who do such things , and we know his judgment is right .
ERV	Romans	2	3	And since you do the same things as those people you judge , surely you understand that God will punish you too . How could you think you would be able to escape his judgment ?
ERV	Romans	2	4	God has been kind to you . He has been very patient , waiting for you to change . But you think nothing of his kindness . Maybe you don ’ t understand that God is kind to you so that you will decide to change your lives .
ERV	Romans	2	5	But you are so stubborn ! You refuse to change . So you are making your own punishment greater and greater . You will be punished on the day when God will show his anger . On that day everyone will see how right God is to judge people .
ERV	Romans	2	6	He will reward or punish everyone for what they have done .
ERV	Romans	2	7	Some people live for God ’ s glory , for honor , and for life that can not be destroyed . They live for those things by always continuing to do good . God will give eternal life to them .
ERV	Romans	2	8	But others are selfish and refuse to follow truth . They follow evil . God will show his anger and punish them .
ERV	Romans	2	9	He will give trouble and suffering to everyone who does evil—to the Jews first and also to those who are not Jews .
ERV	Romans	2	10	But he will give glory , honor , and peace to everyone who does good—to the Jews first and also to those who are not Jews .
ERV	Romans	2	11	God judges everyone the same . It doesn ’ t matter who they are .
ERV	Romans	2	12	People who have the law and those who have never heard of the law are all the same when they sin . People who don ’ t have the law and are sinners will be lost . And , in the same way , those who have the law and are sinners will be judged by the law .
ERV	Romans	2	13	Hearing the law does not make people right with God . They will be right before him only if they always do what the law says .
ERV	Romans	2	14	Those who are not Jews don ’ t have the law . But when they naturally do what the law commands without even knowing the law , then they are their own law . This is true even though they don ’ t have the written law .
ERV	Romans	2	15	They show that in their hearts they know what is right and wrong , the same as the law commands , and their consciences agree . Sometimes their thoughts tell them that they have done wrong , and this makes them guilty . And sometimes their thoughts tell them that they have done right , and this makes them not guilty .
ERV	Romans	2	16	All this will happen on the day when God will judge people ’ s secret thoughts through Jesus Christ . This is part of the Good News that I tell everyone . The Jews and the Law
ERV	Romans	2	17	What about you ? You say you are a Jew . You trust in the law and proudly claim to be close to God .
ERV	Romans	2	18	You know what God wants you to do . And you know what is important , because you have learned the law .
ERV	Romans	2	19	You think you are a guide for people who don ’ t know the right way , a light for those who are in the dark .
ERV	Romans	2	20	You think you can show foolish people what is right . And you think you are a teacher for those who are just beginning to learn . You have the law , and so you think you know everything and have all truth .
ERV	Romans	2	21	You teach others , so why don ’ t you teach yourself ? You tell them not to steal , but you yourself steal .
ERV	Romans	2	22	You say they must not commit adultery , but you yourself are guilty of that sin . You hate idols , but you steal them from their temples .
ERV	Romans	2	23	You are so proud that you have God ’ s law , but you bring shame to God by breaking his law .
ERV	Romans	2	24	As the Scriptures say , “ People in other nations insult God because of you. ” [ a ]
ERV	Romans	2	25	If you follow the law , then your circumcision has meaning . But if you break the law , then it is as if you were never circumcised .
ERV	Romans	2	26	Those who are not Jews are not circumcised . But if they do what the law says , it is as if they were circumcised .
ERV	Romans	2	27	You have the written law and circumcision , but you break the law . So those who are not circumcised in their bodies , but still obey the law , will show that you are guilty .
ERV	Romans	2	28	You are not a true Jew if you are only a Jew in your physical body . True circumcision is not only on the outside of the body .
ERV	Romans	2	29	A true Jew is one who is a Jew inside . True circumcision is done in the heart . It is done by the Spirit , not by the written law . And anyone who is circumcised in the heart by the Spirit gets praise from God , not from people . Footnotes - Romans 2:24 Quote from Isa . 52:5 . See also Ezek . 36:20-23 .
ERV	Romans	3	3	It is true that some Jews were not faithful to God . But will that stop God from doing what he promised ?
ERV	Romans	3	2	Yes , the Jews have many benefits . The most important one is this : God trusted the Jews with his teachings .
ERV	Romans	3	4	No , even if everyone else is a liar , God will always do what he says . As the Scriptures say about him , “ You will be proved right in what you say , and you will win when people accuse you. ” ( A )
ERV	Romans	3	5	When we do wrong , that shows more clearly that God is right . So can we say that God does wrong when he punishes us ? ( That ’ s the way some people think . )
ERV	Romans	3	6	Of course not . If God could not punish us , how could he judge the world ?
ERV	Romans	3	7	Someone might say , “ When I lie , it really gives God glory , because my lie makes his truth easier to see . So why am I judged a sinner ? ”
ERV	Romans	3	8	It would be the same to say , “ We should do evil so that good will come. ” Many people criticize us , saying that ’ s what we teach . They are wrong , and they should be condemned for saying that . All People Are Guilty
ERV	Romans	3	9	So are we Jews better than other people ? No , we have already said that those who are Jews , as well as those who are not Jews , are the same . They are all guilty of sin .
ERV	Romans	3	10	As the Scriptures say , “ There is no one doing what is right , not even one .
ERV	Romans	3	11	There is no one who understands . There is no one who is trying to be with God .
ERV	Romans	3	12	They have all turned away from him , and now they are of no use to anyone . There is no one who does good , not even one. ” ( B )
ERV	Romans	3	13	“ Their words come from mouths that are like open graves . They use their lying tongues to deceive others. ” ( C ) “ Their words are like the poison of snakes. ” ( D )
ERV	Romans	3	14	“ Their mouths are full of cursing and angry words. ” ( E )
ERV	Romans	3	15	“ They are always ready to kill someone .
ERV	Romans	3	16	Everywhere they go they cause trouble and ruin .
ERV	Romans	3	17	They don ’ t know how to live in peace. ” ( F )
ERV	Romans	3	18	“ They have no fear or respect for God. ” ( G )
ERV	Romans	3	19	What the law says is for those who are under the law . It stops anyone from making excuses . And it brings the whole world under God ’ s judgment ,
ERV	Romans	3	20	because no one can be made right with God by following the law . The law only shows us our sin . How God Makes People Right
ERV	Romans	3	21	But God has a way to make people right , and it has nothing to do with the law . He has now shown us that new way , which the law and the prophets told us about .
ERV	Romans	3	22	God makes people right through their faith in [ a ] Jesus Christ . He does this for all who believe in Christ . Everyone is the same .
ERV	Romans	3	23	All have sinned and are not good enough to share God ’ s divine greatness .
ERV	Romans	3	24	They are made right with God by his grace . This is a free gift . They are made right with God by being made free from sin through Jesus Christ . 25-26 God gave Jesus as a way to forgive people ’ s sins through their faith in him . God can forgive them because the blood sacrifice of Jesus pays for their sins . God gave Jesus to show that he always does what is right and fair . He was right in the past when he was patient and did not punish people for their sins . And in our own time he still does what is right . God worked all this out in a way that allows him to judge people fairly and still make right any person who has faith in Jesus .
ERV	Romans	3	27	So do we have any reason to boast about ourselves ? No reason at all . And why not ? Because we are depending on the way of faith , not on what we have done in following the law .
ERV	Romans	3	28	I mean we are made right with God through faith , not through what we have done to follow the law . This is what we believe .
ERV	Romans	3	29	God is not only the God of the Jews . He is also the God of those who are not Jews .
ERV	Romans	3	30	There is only one God . He will make Jews [ b ] right with him by their faith , and he will also make non-Jews [ c ] right with him through their faith .
ERV	Romans	3	31	So do we destroy the law by following the way of faith ? Not at all ! In fact , faith causes us to be what the law actually wants .

ERV	Romans	4	4	When people work , their pay is not given to them as a gift . They earn the pay they get .
ERV	Romans	4	2	If Abraham was made right by the things he did , he had a reason to boast about himself . But God knew different .
ERV	Romans	4	3	That ’ s why the Scriptures say , “ Abraham believed God , and because of this he was accepted as one who is right with God. ” [ a ]
ERV	Romans	4	5	But people can not do any work that will make them right with God . So they must trust in him . Then he accepts their faith , and that makes them right with him . He is the one who makes even evil people right .
ERV	Romans	4	6	David said the same thing when he was talking about the blessing people have when God accepts them as good without looking at what they have done :
ERV	Romans	4	7	“ It is a great blessing when people are forgiven for the wrongs they have done , when their sins are erased !
ERV	Romans	4	8	It is a great blessing when the Lord accepts people as if they are without sin ! ” ( A )
ERV	Romans	4	9	Is this blessing only for those who are circumcised ? Or is it also for those who are not circumcised ? We have already said that it was because of Abraham ’ s faith that he was accepted as one who is right with God .
ERV	Romans	4	10	So how did this happen ? Did God accept Abraham before or after he was circumcised ? God accepted him before his circumcision .
ERV	Romans	4	11	Abraham was circumcised later to show that God accepted him . His circumcision was proof that he was right with God through faith before he was circumcised . So Abraham is the father of all those who believe but are not circumcised . They believe and are accepted as people who are right with God .
ERV	Romans	4	12	And Abraham is also the father of those who have been circumcised . But it is not their circumcision that makes him their father . He is their father only if they live following the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised . God ’ s Promise Received Through Faith
ERV	Romans	4	13	Abraham and his descendants received the promise that they would get the whole world . But Abraham did not receive that promise because he followed the law . He received that promise because he was right with God through his faith .
ERV	Romans	4	14	If people could get God ’ s promise by following the law , then faith is worthless . And God ’ s promise to Abraham is worthless ,
ERV	Romans	4	15	because the law can only bring God ’ s anger on those who disobey it . But if there is no law , then there is nothing to disobey .
ERV	Romans	4	16	So people get what God promised by having faith . This happens so that the promise can be a free gift . And if the promise is a free gift , then all of Abraham ’ s people will get that promise . The promise is not just for those who live under the Law of Moses . It is for all who live with faith as Abraham did . He is the father of us all .
ERV	Romans	4	17	As the Scriptures say , “ I have made you a father of many nations. ” [ b ] This is true before God , the one Abraham believed—the God who gives life to the dead and speaks of things that don ’ t yet exist as if they are real .
ERV	Romans	4	18	There was no hope that Abraham would have children , but Abraham believed God and continued to hope . And that is why he became the father of many nations . As God told him , “ You will have many descendants. ” [ c ]
ERV	Romans	4	19	Abraham was almost a hundred years old , so he was past the age for having children . Also , Sarah could not have children . Abraham was well aware of this , but his faith in God never became weak .
ERV	Romans	4	20	He never doubted that God would do what he promised . He never stopped believing . In fact , he grew stronger in his faith and just praised God .
ERV	Romans	4	21	Abraham felt sure that God was able to do what he promised .
ERV	Romans	4	22	So that ’ s why “ he was accepted as one who is right with God. ” [ d ]
ERV	Romans	4	23	These words ( “ he was accepted ” ) were written not only for Abraham .
ERV	Romans	4	24	They were also written for us . God will also accept us because we believe . We believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from death .
ERV	Romans	4	25	Jesus was handed over to die for our sins , and he was raised from death to make us right with God . Footnotes - Romans 4:3 Quote from Gen. 15:6 . - Romans 4:17 Quote from Gen. 17:5 . - Romans 4:18 Quote from Gen. 15:5 . - Romans 4:22 Quote from Gen. 15:6 .
ERV	Romans	5	5	And this hope will never disappoint us . We know this because God has poured out his love to fill our hearts through the Holy Spirit he gave us .
ERV	Romans	5	2	Through our faith , Christ has brought us into that blessing of God ’ s grace that we now enjoy . And we are very happy because of the hope we have of sharing God ’ s glory .
ERV	Romans	5	3	And we are also happy with the troubles we have . Why are we happy with troubles ? Because we know that these troubles make us more patient .
ERV	Romans	5	4	And this patience is proof that we are strong . And this proof gives us hope .
ERV	Romans	5	6	Christ died for us when we were unable to help ourselves . We were living against God , but at just the right time Christ died for us .
ERV	Romans	5	7	Very few people will die to save the life of someone else , even if it is for a good person . Someone might be willing to die for an especially good person .
ERV	Romans	5	8	But Christ died for us while we were still sinners , and by this God showed how much he loves us .
ERV	Romans	5	9	We have been made right with God by the blood sacrifice of Christ . So through Christ we will surely be saved from God ’ s anger .
ERV	Romans	5	10	I mean that while we were God ’ s enemies , he made friends with us through his Son ’ s death . And the fact that we are now God ’ s friends makes it even more certain that he will save us through his Son ’ s life .
ERV	Romans	5	11	And not only will we be saved , but we also rejoice right now in what God has done for us through our Lord Jesus Christ . It is because of Jesus that we are now God ’ s friends . Adam and Christ
ERV	Romans	5	12	Sin came into the world because of what one man did . And with sin came death . So this is why all people must die—because all people have sinned .
ERV	Romans	5	13	Sin was in the world before the Law of Moses . But God does not consider people guilty of sin if there is no law .
ERV	Romans	5	14	But from the time of Adam to the time of Moses , everyone had to die . Adam died because he sinned by not obeying God ’ s command . But even those who did not sin that same way had to die . That one man , Adam , can be compared to Christ , the one who was coming in the future .
ERV	Romans	5	15	But God ’ s free gift is not like Adam ’ s sin . Many people died because of the sin of that one man . But the grace that people received from God was much greater . Many received God ’ s gift of life by the grace of this other man , Jesus Christ .
ERV	Romans	5	16	After Adam sinned once , he was judged guilty . But the gift of God is different . His free gift came after many sins , and it makes people right with him .
ERV	Romans	5	17	One man sinned , and so death ruled all people because of that one man . But now some people accept God ’ s full grace and his great gift of being made right . Surely they will have true life and rule through the one man , Jesus Christ .
ERV	Romans	5	18	So that one sin of Adam brought the punishment of death to all people . But in the same way , Christ did something so good that it makes all people right with God . And that brings them true life .
ERV	Romans	5	19	One man disobeyed God and many became sinners . But in the same way , one man obeyed God and many will be made right .
ERV	Romans	5	20	The law was brought in so that more people would sin the way Adam did . But where sin increased , there was even more of God ’ s grace .
ERV	Romans	5	21	Sin once used death to rule us . But God gave us more of his grace so that grace could rule by making us right with him . And this brings us eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
ERV	Romans	6	6	We know that our old life was put to death on the cross with Christ . This happened so that our sinful selves would have no power over us . Then we would not be slaves to sin .
ERV	Romans	6	2	Of course not ! Our old sinful life ended . It ’ s dead . So how can we continue living in sin ?
ERV	Romans	6	3	Did you forget that all of us became part of Christ Jesus when we were baptized ? In our baptism we shared in his death .
ERV	Romans	6	4	So when we were baptized , we were buried with Christ and took part in his death . And just as Christ was raised from death by the wonderful power of the Father , so we can now live a new life .
ERV	Romans	6	5	Christ died , and we have been joined with him by dying too . So we will also be joined with him by rising from death as he did .
ERV	Romans	6	7	Anyone who has died is made free from sin ’ s control .
ERV	Romans	6	8	If we died with Christ , we know that we will also live with him .
ERV	Romans	6	9	Christ was raised from death . And we know that he can not die again . Death has no power over him now .
ERV	Romans	6	10	Yes , when Christ died , he died to defeat the power of sin one time—enough for all time . He now has a new life , and his new life is with God .
ERV	Romans	6	11	In the same way , you should see yourselves as being dead to the power of sin and alive for God through Christ Jesus .
ERV	Romans	6	12	But don ’ t let sin control your life here on earth . You must not be ruled by the things your sinful self makes you want to do .
ERV	Romans	6	13	Don ’ t offer the parts of your body to serve sin . Don ’ t use your bodies to do evil , but offer yourselves to God , as people who have died and now live . Offer the parts of your body to God to be used for doing good .
ERV	Romans	6	14	Sin will not be your master , because you are not under law . You now live under God ’ s grace . Slaves of Goodness
ERV	Romans	6	15	So what should we do ? Should we sin because we are under grace and not under law ? Certainly not !
ERV	Romans	6	16	Surely you know that you become the slaves of whatever you give yourselves to . Anything or anyone you follow will be your master . You can follow sin , or you can obey God . Following sin brings spiritual death , but obeying God makes you right with him .
ERV	Romans	6	17	In the past you were slaves to sin—sin controlled you . But thank God , you fully obeyed what you were taught .
ERV	Romans	6	18	You were made free from sin , and now you are slaves to what is right .
ERV	Romans	6	19	I use this example from everyday life because you need help in understanding spiritual truths . In the past you offered the parts of your body to be slaves to your immoral and sinful thoughts . The result was that you lived only for sin . In the same way , you must now offer yourselves to be slaves to what is right . Then you will live only for God .
ERV	Romans	6	20	In the past you were slaves to sin , and you did not even think about doing right .
ERV	Romans	6	21	You did evil things , and now you are ashamed of what you did . Did those things help you ? No , they only brought death .
ERV	Romans	6	22	But now you are free from sin . You have become slaves of God , and the result is that you live only for God . This will bring you eternal life .
ERV	Romans	6	23	When people sin , they earn what sin pays—death . But God gives his people a free gift—eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord .
ERV	Romans	7	7	You might think I am saying that sin and the law are the same . That is not true . But the law was the only way I could learn what sin means . I would never have known it is wrong to want something that is not mine . But the law said , “ You must not want what belongs to someone else. ” [ a ]
ERV	Romans	7	2	It ’ s like what the law says about marriage : A woman must stay married to her husband as long as he is alive . But if her husband dies , she is made free from the law of marriage .
ERV	Romans	7	3	But if she marries another man while her husband is still alive , the law says she is guilty of adultery . But if her husband dies , she is made free from the law of marriage . So if she marries another man after her husband dies , she is not guilty of adultery .
ERV	Romans	7	4	In the same way , my brothers and sisters , your old selves died and you became free from the law through the body of Christ . Now you belong to someone else . You belong to the one who was raised from death . We belong to Christ so that we can be used in service to God .
ERV	Romans	7	5	In the past we were ruled by our sinful selves . The law made us want to do sinful things . And those sinful desires controlled our bodies , so that what we did only brought us spiritual death .
ERV	Romans	7	6	In the past the law held us as prisoners , but our old selves died , and we were made free from the law . So now we serve God in a new way , not in the old way , with the written rules . Now we serve God in the new way , with the Spirit . Our Fight Against Sin
ERV	Romans	7	8	And sin found a way to use that command and make me want all kinds of things that weren ’ t mine . So sin came to me because of the command . But without the law , sin has no power .
ERV	Romans	7	9	Before I knew the law , I was alive . But when I heard the law ’ s command , sin began to live ,
ERV	Romans	7	10	and I died spiritually . The command was meant to bring life , but for me it brought death .
ERV	Romans	7	11	Sin found a way to fool me by using the command to make me die .
ERV	Romans	7	12	Now the law is holy , and the command is holy and right and good .
ERV	Romans	7	13	Does this mean that something that is good brought death to me ? No , it was sin that used the good command to bring me death . This shows how terrible sin really is . It can use a good command to produce a result that shows sin at its very worst . The War Inside Us
ERV	Romans	7	14	We know that the law is spiritual , but I am not . I am so human . Sin rules me as if I were its slave .
ERV	Romans	7	15	I don ’ t understand why I act the way I do . I don ’ t do the good I want to do , and I do the evil I hate .
ERV	Romans	7	16	And if I don ’ t want to do what I do , that means I agree that the law is good .
ERV	Romans	7	17	But I am not really the one doing the evil . It is sin living in me that does it .
ERV	Romans	7	18	Yes , I know that nothing good lives in me—I mean nothing good lives in the part of me that is not spiritual . I want to do what is good , but I don ’ t do it .
ERV	Romans	7	19	I don ’ t do the good that I want to do . I do the evil that I don ’ t want to do .
ERV	Romans	7	20	So if I do what I don ’ t want to do , then I am not really the one doing it . It is the sin living in me that does it .
ERV	Romans	7	21	So I have learned this rule : When I want to do good , evil is there with me .
ERV	Romans	7	22	In my mind I am happy with God ’ s law .
ERV	Romans	7	23	But I see another law working in my body . That law makes war against the law that my mind accepts . That other law working in my body is the law of sin , and that law makes me its prisoner .
ERV	Romans	7	24	What a miserable person I am ! Who will save me from this body that brings me death ?
ERV	Romans	7	25	I thank God for his salvation through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So in my mind I am a slave to God ’ s law , but in my sinful self I am a slave to the law of sin . Footnotes - Romans 7:7 Quote from Ex . 20:17 ; Deut . 5:21 .
ERV	Romans	8	8	Those who are ruled by their sinful selves can not please God .
ERV	Romans	8	2	That is because in Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit that brings life made you [ a ] free . It made you free from the law that brings sin and death .
ERV	Romans	8	3	The law was without power because it was made weak by our sinful selves . But God did what the law could not do : He sent his own Son to earth with the same human life that everyone else uses for sin . God sent him to be an offering to pay for sin . So God used a human life to destroy sin .
ERV	Romans	8	4	He did this so that we could be right just as the law said we must be . Now we don ’ t live following our sinful selves . We live following the Spirit .
ERV	Romans	8	5	People who live following their sinful selves think only about what they want . But those who live following the Spirit are thinking about what the Spirit wants them to do .
ERV	Romans	8	6	If your thinking is controlled by your sinful self , there is spiritual death . But if your thinking is controlled by the Spirit , there is life and peace .
ERV	Romans	8	7	Why is this true ? Because anyone whose thinking is controlled by their sinful self is against God . They refuse to obey God ’ s law . And really they are not able to obey it .
ERV	Romans	8	9	But you are not ruled by your sinful selves . You are ruled by the Spirit , if that Spirit of God really lives in you . But whoever does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to Christ .
ERV	Romans	8	10	Your body will always be dead because of sin . But if Christ is in you , then the Spirit gives you life , because Christ made you right with God .
ERV	Romans	8	11	God raised Jesus from death . And if God ’ s Spirit lives in you , he will also give life to your bodies that die . Yes , God is the one who raised Christ from death , and he will raise you to life through his Spirit living in you .
ERV	Romans	8	12	So , my brothers and sisters , we must not be ruled by our sinful selves . We must not live the way our sinful selves want .
ERV	Romans	8	13	If you use your lives to do what your sinful selves want , you will die spiritually . But if you use the Spirit ’ s help to stop doing the wrong things you do with your body , you will have true life .
ERV	Romans	8	14	The true children of God are those who let God ’ s Spirit lead them .
ERV	Romans	8	15	The Spirit that we received is not a spirit that makes us slaves again and causes us to fear . The Spirit that we have makes us God ’ s chosen children . And with that Spirit we cry out , “ Abba , [ b ] Father. ”
ERV	Romans	8	16	And the Spirit himself speaks to our spirits and makes us sure that we are God ’ s children .
ERV	Romans	8	17	If we are God ’ s children , we will get the blessings God has for his people . He will give us all that he has given Christ . But we must suffer like Christ suffered . Then we will be able to share his glory . We Will Have Glory in the Future
ERV	Romans	8	18	We have sufferings now , but these are nothing compared to the great glory that will be given to us .
ERV	Romans	8	19	Everything that God made is waiting with excitement for the time when he will show the world who his children are . The whole world wants very much for that to happen .
ERV	Romans	8	20	Everything God made was allowed to become like something that can not fulfill its purpose . That was not its choice , but God made it happen with this hope in view :
ERV	Romans	8	21	That the creation would be made free from ruin—that everything God made would have the same freedom and glory that belong to God ’ s children .
ERV	Romans	8	22	We know that everything God made has been waiting until now in pain like a woman ready to give birth to a child .
ERV	Romans	8	23	Not only the world , but we also have been waiting with pain inside us . We have the Spirit as the first part of God ’ s promise . So we are waiting for God to finish making us his own children . I mean we are waiting for our bodies to be made free .
ERV	Romans	8	24	We were saved to have this hope . If we can see what we are waiting for , that is not really hope . People don ’ t hope for something they already have .
ERV	Romans	8	25	But we are hoping for something we don ’ t have yet , and we are waiting for it patiently .
ERV	Romans	8	26	Also , the Spirit helps us . We are very weak , but the Spirit helps us with our weakness . We don ’ t know how to pray as we should , but the Spirit himself speaks to God for us . He begs God for us , speaking to him with feelings too deep for words .
ERV	Romans	8	27	God already knows our deepest thoughts . And he understands what the Spirit is saying , because the Spirit speaks for his people in the way that agrees with what God wants .
ERV	Romans	8	28	We know that in everything God works for the good of those who love him . These are the people God chose , because that was his plan .
ERV	Romans	8	29	God knew them before he made the world . And he decided that they would be like his Son . Then Jesus would be the firstborn of many brothers and sisters .
ERV	Romans	8	30	God planned for them to be like his Son . He chose them and made them right with him . And after he made them right , he gave them his glory . God ’ s Love in Christ Jesus
ERV	Romans	8	31	So what should we say about this ? If God is for us , no one can stand against us . And God is with us .
ERV	Romans	8	32	He even let his own Son suffer for us . God gave his Son for all of us . So now with Jesus , God will surely give us all things .
ERV	Romans	8	33	Who can accuse the people God has chosen ? No one ! God is the one who makes them right .
ERV	Romans	8	34	Who can say that God ’ s people are guilty ? No one ! Christ Jesus died for us , but that is not all . He was also raised from death . And now he is at God ’ s right side , speaking to him for us .
ERV	Romans	8	35	Can anything separate us from Christ ’ s love ? Can trouble or problems or persecution separate us from his love ? If we have no food or clothes or face danger or even death , will that separate us from his love ?
ERV	Romans	8	36	As the Scriptures say , “ For you we are in danger of death all the time . People think we are worth no more than sheep to be killed. ” ( A )
ERV	Romans	8	37	But in all these troubles we have complete victory through God , who has shown his love for us . 38-39 Yes , I am sure that nothing can separate us from God ’ s love—not death , life , angels , or ruling spirits . I am sure that nothing now , nothing in the future , no powers , nothing above us or nothing below us—nothing in the whole created world—will ever be able to separate us from the love God has shown us in Christ Jesus our Lord . Footnotes - Romans 8:2 you Some Greek copies have “ me. ” Also in the next sentence . - Romans 8:15 Abba An Aramaic word that was used by Jewish children as a name for their fathers .
ERV	Romans	9	9	Here is what God said in that promise : “ About this time next year I will come back , and Sarah will have a son. ” [ d ]
ERV	Romans	9	2	I have great sorrow and always feel much sadness
ERV	Romans	9	3	for my own people . They are my brothers and sisters , my earthly family . I wish I could help them . I would even have a curse on me and cut myself off from Christ if that would help them .
ERV	Romans	9	4	They are the people of Israel , God ’ s chosen children . They have the glory of God and the agreements he made between himself and his people . God gave them the Law of Moses , the Temple worship , and his promises .
ERV	Romans	9	5	They are the descendants of our great fathers , and they are the earthly family of the Messiah , who is God over all things . Praise him forever ! [ a ] Amen .
ERV	Romans	9	6	I don ’ t mean that God failed to keep his promise to the Jewish people . But only some of the people of Israel are really God ’ s people . [ b ]
ERV	Romans	9	7	And only some of Abraham ’ s descendants are true children of Abraham . This is what God said to Abraham : “ Your true descendants will be those who come through Isaac. ” [ c ]
ERV	Romans	9	8	This means that not all of Abraham ’ s descendants are God ’ s true children . Abraham ’ s true children are those who become God ’ s children because of the promise he made to Abraham .
ERV	Romans	9	10	And that is not all . Rebecca also had sons , and they had the same father . He is our father Isaac . 11-12 But before the two sons were born , God told Rebecca , “ The older son will serve the younger. ” [ e ] This was before the boys had done anything good or bad . God said this before they were born so that the boy he wanted would be chosen because of God ’ s own plan . He was chosen because he was the one God wanted to call , not because of anything the boys did .
ERV	Romans	9	13	As the Scriptures say , “ I loved Jacob , but I hated Esau. ” [ f ]

ERV	Romans	9	15	God said to Moses , “ I will show mercy to anyone I want to show mercy to . I will show pity to anyone I choose. ” [ g ]
ERV	Romans	9	16	So God will choose anyone he decides to show mercy to , and his choice does not depend on what people want or try to do .
ERV	Romans	9	17	In the Scriptures God says to Pharaoh : “ I made you king so that you could do this for me . I wanted to show my power through you . I wanted my name to be announced throughout the world. ” [ h ]
ERV	Romans	9	18	So God shows mercy to those he wants to show mercy to and makes stubborn those he wants to make stubborn .
ERV	Romans	9	19	So one of you will ask me , “ If God controls what we do , why does he blame us for our sins ? ”
ERV	Romans	9	20	Don ’ t ask that . You are only human and have no right to question God . A clay jar does not question the one who made it . It does not say , “ Why did you make me like this ? ”
ERV	Romans	9	21	The one who makes the jar can make anything he wants . He uses the same clay to make different things . He might make one thing for special purposes and another for daily use .
ERV	Romans	9	22	It is the same way with what God has done . He wanted to show his anger and to let people see his power . But he patiently endured those he was angry with—people who were ready to be destroyed .
ERV	Romans	9	23	He waited with patience so that he could make known the riches of his glory to the people he has chosen to receive his mercy . God has already prepared them to share his glory .
ERV	Romans	9	24	We are those people , the ones God chose not only from the Jews but also from those who are not Jews .
ERV	Romans	9	25	As the Scriptures say in the book of Hosea , “ The people who are not mine— I will say they are my people . And the people I did not love— I will say they are the people I love. ” ( A )
ERV	Romans	9	26	And , “ Where God said in the past , ‘ You are not my people ’ — there they will be called children of the living God. ” ( B )
ERV	Romans	9	27	And Isaiah cries out about Israel : “ There are so many people of Israel , they are like the grains of sand by the sea . But only a few of them will be saved .
ERV	Romans	9	28	Yes , the Lord will quickly finish judging the people on the earth. ” ( C )
ERV	Romans	9	29	It is just as Isaiah said : “ The Lord All-Powerful allowed some of our people to live . If he had not done that , we would now be like Sodom , and we would be like Gomorrah. ” ( D )
ERV	Romans	9	30	So what does all this mean ? It means that people who are not Jews were made right with God because of their faith , even though they were not trying to make themselves right .
ERV	Romans	9	31	And the people of Israel , who tried to make themselves right with God by following the law , did not succeed .
ERV	Romans	9	32	They failed because they tried to make themselves right by the things they did . They did not trust in God to make them right . They fell over the stone that makes people fall .
ERV	Romans	9	33	The Scriptures talk about that stone : “ Look , I put in Zion a stone that will make people stumble . It is a rock that will make people fall . But anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed. ” ( E ) Footnotes - Romans 9:5 Messiah , who is … forever ! Or “ Messiah . May God , who rules over all things , be praised forever ! ” - Romans 9:6 God ’ s people Literally , “ Israel , ” the people God chose to bring his blessings to the world . - Romans 9:7 Quote from Gen. 21:12 . - Romans 9:9 Quote from Gen. 18:10 ,
ERV	Romans	10	10	Yes , we believe in Jesus deep in our hearts , and so we are made right with God . And we openly say that we believe in him , and so we are saved .
ERV	Romans	10	2	I can say this about them : They really try hard to follow God , but they don ’ t know the right way .
ERV	Romans	10	3	They did not know the way that God makes people right with him . And they tried to make themselves right in their own way . So they did not accept God ’ s way of making people right .
ERV	Romans	10	4	Christ ended the law so that everyone who believes in him is made right with God .
ERV	Romans	10	5	Moses writes about being made right by following the law . He says , “ The person who obeys these laws is the one who will have life through them. ” [ a ]
ERV	Romans	10	6	But this is what the Scriptures say about being made right through faith : “ Don ’ t say to yourself , ‘ Who will go up into heaven ? ’ ” ( This means “ Who will go up to heaven to get Christ and bring him down to earth ? ” )
ERV	Romans	10	7	“ And don ’ t say , ‘ Who will go down into the world below ? ’ ” ( This means “ Who will go down to get Christ and bring him up from death ? ” )
ERV	Romans	10	8	This is what the Scripture says : “ God ’ s teaching is near you ; it is in your mouth and in your heart. ” [ b ] It is the teaching of faith that we tell people .
ERV	Romans	10	9	If you openly say , “ Jesus is Lord ” and believe in your heart that God raised him from death , you will be saved .
ERV	Romans	10	11	Yes , the Scriptures say , “ Anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed. ” [ c ]
ERV	Romans	10	12	It says this because there is no difference between those who are Jews and those who are not . The same Lord is the Lord of all people . And he richly blesses everyone who looks to him for help .
ERV	Romans	10	13	Yes , “ everyone who trusts in the Lord [ d ] will be saved. ” [ e ]
ERV	Romans	10	14	But before people can pray to the Lord for help , they must believe in him . And before they can believe in the Lord , they must hear about him . And for anyone to hear about the Lord , someone must tell them .
ERV	Romans	10	15	And before anyone can go and tell them , they must be sent . As the Scriptures say , “ How wonderful it is to see someone coming to tell good news ! ” [ f ]
ERV	Romans	10	16	But not all the people accepted that good news . Isaiah said , “ Lord , who believed what we told them ? ” [ g ]
ERV	Romans	10	17	So faith comes from hearing the Good News . And people hear the Good News when someone tells them about Christ .
ERV	Romans	10	18	But I ask , “ Did those people not hear the Good News ? ” Yes , they heard—as the Scriptures say , “ Their voices went out all around the world . Their words went everywhere in the world. ” ( A )
ERV	Romans	10	19	Again I ask , “ Did the people of Israel not understand ? ” Yes , they did understand . First , Moses says this for God : “ I will use those who are not really a nation to make you jealous . I will use a nation that does not understand to make you angry. ” ( B )
ERV	Romans	10	20	Then Isaiah is bold enough to say this for God : “ The people who were not looking for me— they are the ones who found me . I made myself known to those who did not ask for me. ” ( C )
ERV	Romans	10	21	But about the people of Israel God says , “ All day long I stood ready to accept those people , but they are stubborn and refuse to obey me. ” ( D ) Footnotes - Romans 10:5 Quote from Lev . 18:5 . - Romans 10:8 Quotes from Deut . 30:12-14 . - Romans 10:11 Quote from Isa . 28:16 . - Romans 10:13 who trusts in the Lord Literally , “ who calls on the name of the Lord , ” meaning to show faith in him by worshiping him or praying to him for help . - Romans 10:13 Quote from Joel 2:32 . - Romans 10:15 Quote from Isa . 52:7 . - Romans 10:16 Quote from Isa . 53:1 .
ERV	Romans	11	11	So I ask : When the Jews fell , did that fall destroy them ? No ! But their mistake brought salvation to those who are not Jews . The purpose of this was to make the Jews jealous .
ERV	Romans	11	2	God chose the Israelites to be his people before they were born . And he did not force them to leave . Surely you know what the Scriptures say about Elijah . The Scriptures tell about Elijah praying to God against the people of Israel . He said ,
ERV	Romans	11	3	“ Lord , they have killed your prophets and destroyed your altars . I am the only prophet still living , and they are trying to kill me now. ” [ a ]
ERV	Romans	11	4	But what answer did God give to Elijah ? God said , “ I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have never given worship to Baal. ” [ b ]
ERV	Romans	11	5	It is the same now . God has chosen a few people by his grace .
ERV	Romans	11	6	And if he chose them by grace , then it is not what they have done that made them his people . If they could be made his people by what they did , his gift of grace would not really be a gift .
ERV	Romans	11	7	So this is what has happened : The people of Israel wanted God ’ s blessing , but they did not all get it . The people he chose did get his blessing , but the others became hard and refused to listen to him .
ERV	Romans	11	8	As the Scriptures say , “ God caused the people to fall asleep. ” ( A ) “ God closed their eyes so that they could not see , and he closed their ears so that they could not hear . This continues until now. ” ( B )
ERV	Romans	11	9	And David says , “ Let those people be caught and trapped at their own feasts . Let them fall and be punished .
ERV	Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be closed so that they can not see . And let them be troubled forever. ” ( C )
ERV	Romans	11	12	Their mistake brought rich blessings to the world . And what they lost brought rich blessings to the non-Jewish people . So surely the world will get much richer blessings when enough Jews become the kind of people God wants .
ERV	Romans	11	13	Now I am speaking to you people who are not Jews . I am an apostle to the non-Jewish people . So while I have that work , I will do the best I can .
ERV	Romans	11	14	. - Romans 11:4 Quote from
ERV	Romans	11	15	God turned away from the Jews . When that happened , he became friends with the other people in the world . So when he accepts the Jews , it will be like bringing people to life after death .
ERV	Romans	11	16	If the first piece of bread is offered to God , then the whole loaf is made holy . If the roots of a tree are holy , the tree ’ s branches are holy too .
ERV	Romans	11	17	It is as if some of the branches from an olive tree have been broken off , and the branch of a wild olive tree has been joined to that first tree . If you are not a Jew , you are the same as that wild branch , and you now share the strength and life of the first tree .
ERV	Romans	11	18	But don ’ t act as if you are better than those branches that were broken off . You have no reason to be proud of yourself , because you don ’ t give life to the root . The root gives life to you .
ERV	Romans	11	19	You might say , “ Branches were broken off so that I could be joined to their tree. ”
ERV	Romans	11	20	That is true . But those branches were broken off because they did not believe . And you continue to be part of the tree only because you believe . Don ’ t be proud , but be afraid .
ERV	Romans	11	21	If God did not let the natural branches of that tree stay , he will not let you stay if you stop believing .
ERV	Romans	11	22	So you see that God is kind , but he can also be very strict . He punishes those who stop following him . But he is kind to you , if you continue trusting in his kindness . If you don ’ t continue depending on him , you will be cut off from the tree .
ERV	Romans	11	23	And if the Jews will believe in God again , he will accept them back . He is able to put them back where they were .
ERV	Romans	11	24	It is not natural for a wild branch to become part of a good tree . But you non-Jewish people are like a branch cut from a wild olive tree . And you were joined to a good olive tree . But those Jews are like a branch that grew from the good tree . So surely they can be joined to their own tree again .
ERV	Romans	11	25	I want you to understand this secret truth , brothers and sisters . This truth will help you understand that you don ’ t know everything . The truth is this : Part of Israel has been made stubborn , but that will change when enough non-Jewish people have come to God .
ERV	Romans	11	26	And that is how all Israel will be saved . The Scriptures say , “ The Savior will come from Zion ; he will take away all evil from the family of Jacob .
ERV	Romans	11	27	And I will make this agreement with those people when I take away their sins. ” ( D )
ERV	Romans	11	28	The Jews refuse to accept the Good News , so they are God ’ s enemies . This has happened to help you who are not Jews . But they are still God ’ s chosen people , and he loves them because of the promises he made to their ancestors .
ERV	Romans	11	29	God never changes his mind about the people he calls . He never decides to take back the blessings he has given them .
ERV	Romans	11	30	At one time you refused to obey God . But now you have received mercy , because the Jews refused to obey .
ERV	Romans	11	31	And now they are the ones who refuse to obey , because God showed mercy to you . But this happened so that they can also receive mercy from him .
ERV	Romans	11	32	All people have refused to obey God . And he has put them all together as people who don ’ t obey him so that he can show mercy to everyone . Praise to God
ERV	Romans	11	33	Yes , God ’ s riches are very great ! His wisdom and knowledge have no end ! No one can explain what God decides . No one can understand his ways .
ERV	Romans	11	34	As the Scriptures say , “ Who can know what is on the Lord ’ s mind ? Who is able to give him advice ? ” ( E )
ERV	Romans	11	35	“ Who has ever given God anything ? God owes nothing to anyone. ” ( F )
ERV	Romans	11	36	Yes , God made all things . And everything continues through him and for him . To God be the glory forever ! Amen . Footnotes - Romans 11:3 Quote from
ERV	Romans	11	1	Kings 19:18 .
ERV	Romans	12	12	Be happy because of the hope you have . Be patient when you have troubles . Pray all the time .
ERV	Romans	12	2	Don ’ t change yourselves to be like the people of this world , but let God change you inside with a new way of thinking . Then you will be able to understand and accept what God wants for you . You will be able to know what is good and pleasing to him and what is perfect .
ERV	Romans	12	3	God has given me a special gift , and that is why I have something to say to each one of you . Don ’ t think that you are better than you really are . You must see yourself just as you are . Decide what you are by the faith God has given each of us .
ERV	Romans	12	4	Each one of us has one body , and that body has many parts . These parts don ’ t all do the same thing .
ERV	Romans	12	5	In the same way , we are many people , but in Christ we are all one body . We are the parts of that body , and each part belongs to all the others .
ERV	Romans	12	6	We all have different gifts . Each gift came because of the grace God gave us . Whoever has the gift of prophecy should use that gift in a way that fits the kind of faith they have .
ERV	Romans	12	7	Whoever has the gift of serving should serve . Whoever has the gift of teaching should teach .
ERV	Romans	12	8	Whoever has the gift of comforting others should do that . Whoever has the gift of giving to help others should give generously . Whoever has the gift of leading should work hard at it . Whoever has the gift of showing kindness to others should do it gladly .
ERV	Romans	12	9	Your love must be real . Hate what is evil . Do only what is good .
ERV	Romans	12	10	Love each other in a way that makes you feel close like brothers and sisters . And give each other more honor than you give yourself .
ERV	Romans	12	11	As you serve the Lord , work hard and don ’ t be lazy . Be excited about serving him !
ERV	Romans	12	13	Share with God ’ s people who need help . Look for people who need help and welcome them into your homes .
ERV	Romans	12	14	Wish only good for those who treat you badly . Ask God to bless them , not curse them .
ERV	Romans	12	15	When others are happy , you should be happy with them . And when others are sad , you should be sad too .
ERV	Romans	12	16	Live together in peace with each other . Don ’ t be proud , but be willing to be friends with people who are not important to others . Don ’ t think of yourself as smarter than everyone else .
ERV	Romans	12	17	If someone does you wrong , don ’ t try to pay them back by hurting them . Try to do what everyone thinks is right .
ERV	Romans	12	18	Do the best you can to live in peace with everyone .
ERV	Romans	12	19	My friends , don ’ t try to punish anyone who does wrong to you . Wait for God to punish them with his anger . In the Scriptures the Lord says , “ I am the one who punishes ; I will pay people back. ” ( A )
ERV	Romans	12	20	But you should do this : “ If you have enemies who are hungry , give them something to eat . If you have enemies who are thirsty , give them something to drink . In doing this you will make them feel ashamed . [ b ] ” ( B )
ERV	Romans	12	21	Don ’ t let evil defeat you , but defeat evil by doing good . Footnotes - Romans 12:1 lives Literally , “ bodies. ” Paul is using the language of Old Testament animal sacrifice to express the idea of a complete giving of oneself to God . - Romans 12:20 you will make them feel ashamed Literally , “ you will pour burning coals on their head. ” People in Old Testament times often put ashes on their heads to show that they were sad or sorry .
ERV	Romans	13	13	We should live in a right way , like people who belong to the day . We should not have wild parties or be drunk . We should not be involved in sexual sin or any kind of immoral behavior . We should not cause arguments and trouble or be jealous .
ERV	Romans	13	2	So anyone who is against the government is really against something God has commanded . Those who are against the government bring punishment on themselves .
ERV	Romans	13	3	People who do right don ’ t have to fear the rulers . But those who do wrong must fear them . Do you want to be free from fearing them ? Then do only what is right , and they will praise you .
ERV	Romans	13	4	Rulers are God ’ s servants to help you . But if you do wrong , you have reason to be afraid . They have the power to punish , and they will use it . They are God ’ s servants to punish those who do wrong .
ERV	Romans	13	5	So you must obey the government , not just because you might be punished , but because you know it is the right thing to do .
ERV	Romans	13	6	And this is why you pay taxes too . Those rulers are working for God , and they give all their time to the work of ruling .
ERV	Romans	13	7	Give everyone what you owe them . If you owe them any kind of tax , then pay it . Show respect to those you should respect . And show honor to those you should honor . Loving Others Is the Only Law
ERV	Romans	13	8	You should owe nothing to anyone , except that you will always owe love to each other . The person who loves others has done all that the law commands .
ERV	Romans	13	9	The law says , “ You must not commit adultery , you must not murder anyone , you must not steal , you must not want what belongs to someone else. ” [ a ] All these commands and all other commands are really only one rule : “ Love your neighbor [ b ] the same as you love yourself. ” [ c ]
ERV	Romans	13	10	Love doesn ’ t hurt others . So loving is the same as obeying all the law .
ERV	Romans	13	11	I say this because you know that we live in an important time . Yes , it is now time for you to wake up from your sleep . Our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed .
ERV	Romans	13	12	The night is almost finished . The day is almost here . So we should stop doing whatever belongs to darkness . We should prepare ourselves to fight evil with the weapons that belong to the light .
ERV	Romans	13	14	But be like the Lord Jesus Christ , so that when people see what you do , they will see Christ . Don ’ t think about how to satisfy the desires of your sinful self . Footnotes - Romans 13:9 Quote from Ex . 20:13-15 ,
ERV	Romans	13	17	. - Romans 13:9 your neighbor Or “ others. ” Jesus ’ teaching in Lk . 10:25-37 makes clear that this includes anyone in need . - Romans 13:9 Quote from Lev . 19:18 .
ERV	Romans	14	14	I know that there is no food that is wrong to eat . The Lord Jesus is the one who convinced me of that . But if someone believes that something is wrong , then it is wrong for that person .
ERV	Romans	14	2	Some people believe they can eat any kind of food , [ a ] but those who have doubts eat only vegetables .
ERV	Romans	14	3	Those who know they can eat any kind of food must not feel that they are better than those who eat only vegetables . And those who eat only vegetables must not decide that those who eat all foods are wrong . God has accepted them .
ERV	Romans	14	4	You can not judge the servants of someone else . Their own master decides if they are doing right or wrong . And the Lord ’ s servants will be right , because the Lord is able to make them right .
ERV	Romans	14	5	Some people might believe that one day is more important than another . And others might believe that every day is the same . Everyone should be sure about their beliefs in their own mind .
ERV	Romans	14	6	Those who think one day is more important than other days are doing that for the Lord . And those who eat all kinds of food are doing that for the Lord . Yes , they give thanks to God for that food . And those who refuse to eat some foods do that for the Lord . They also give thanks to God .
ERV	Romans	14	7	We don ’ t live or die just for ourselves .
ERV	Romans	14	8	If we live , we are living for the Lord . And if we die , we are dying for the Lord . So living or dying , we belong to the Lord .
ERV	Romans	14	9	That is why Christ died and rose from death to live again—so that he could be Lord over those who have died and those who are living .
ERV	Romans	14	10	So why do you judge your brother or sister in Christ ? Or why do you think that you are better than they are ? We will all stand before God , and he will judge us all .
ERV	Romans	14	11	Yes , the Scriptures say , “ ‘ As surely as I live , ’ says the Lord , ‘ Everyone will bow before me ; everyone will say that I am God. ’ ” ( A )
ERV	Romans	14	12	So each of us will have to explain to God about the things we do . Don ’ t Cause Others to Sin
ERV	Romans	14	13	So we should stop judging each other . Let ’ s decide not to do anything that will cause a problem for a brother or sister or hurt their faith .
ERV	Romans	14	15	If you hurt the faith of your brother or sister because of something you eat , you are not really following the way of love . Don ’ t destroy anyone ’ s faith by eating something they think is wrong . Christ died for them .
ERV	Romans	14	16	Don ’ t allow what is good for you to become something they say is evil .
ERV	Romans	14	17	In God ’ s kingdom , what we eat and drink is not important . Here is what is important : a right way of life , peace , and joy—all from the Holy Spirit .
ERV	Romans	14	18	Whoever serves Christ by living this way is pleasing God , and they will be accepted by others .
ERV	Romans	14	19	So let ’ s try as hard as we can to do what will bring peace . Let ’ s do whatever will help each other grow stronger in faith .
ERV	Romans	14	20	Don ’ t let the eating of food destroy the work of God . All food is right to eat , but it is wrong for anyone to eat something that hurts the faith of another person .
ERV	Romans	14	21	It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else that hurts the faith of your brother or sister .
ERV	Romans	14	22	You should keep your beliefs about these things a secret between yourself and God . It is a blessing to be able to do what you think is right without feeling guilty .
ERV	Romans	14	23	But anyone who eats something without being sure it is right is doing wrong . That is because they did not believe it was right . And if you do anything that you believe is not right , it is sin . Footnotes - Romans 14:2 any kind of food The Jewish law said there were some foods that Jews could not eat . When they became followers of Christ , some of them did not understand that they could now eat all foods .
ERV	Romans	15	15	But I have written to you very openly about some things that I wanted you to remember . I did this because God gave me this special gift :
ERV	Romans	15	2	but do what pleases them and is for their good . We should do whatever helps everyone grow stronger in faith .
ERV	Romans	15	3	Even Christ did not live trying to please himself . As the Scriptures say about him , “ Those people who insulted you have also insulted me. ” [ a ]
ERV	Romans	15	4	Everything that was written in the past was written to teach us . Those things were written so that we could have hope . That hope comes from the patience and encouragement that the Scriptures give us .
ERV	Romans	15	5	All patience and encouragement come from God . And I pray that God will help you all agree with each other , as Christ Jesus wants .
ERV	Romans	15	6	Then you will all be joined together . And all together you will give glory to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
ERV	Romans	15	7	Christ accepted you , so you should accept each other . This will bring honor [ b ] to God .
ERV	Romans	15	8	I tell you that Christ became a servant of the Jews to show that God has done what he promised their great ancestors .
ERV	Romans	15	9	Christ also did this so that the non-Jewish people could praise God for the mercy he gives to them . The Scriptures say , “ So I will give thanks to you among the people of other nations ; I will sing praise to your name. ” ( A )
ERV	Romans	15	10	And the Scriptures say , “ You people of other nations should be happy together with God ’ s people. ” ( B )
ERV	Romans	15	11	The Scriptures also say , “ Praise the Lord all you people of other nations ; all people should praise the Lord. ” ( C )
ERV	Romans	15	12	And Isaiah says , “ Someone will come from Jesse ’ s family . [ c ] He will come to rule over the nations , and they will put their hope in him. ” ( D )
ERV	Romans	15	13	I pray that the God who gives hope will fill you with much joy and peace as you trust in him . Then you will have more and more hope , and it will flow out of you by the power of the Holy Spirit . Paul Talks About His Work
ERV	Romans	15	14	My brothers and sisters , I know without a doubt that you are full of goodness and have all the knowledge you need . So you are certainly able to counsel each other .
ERV	Romans	15	16	to be a servant of Christ Jesus for those who are not Jews . I serve like a priest whose duty it is to tell God ’ s Good News . He gave me this work so that you non-Jewish people could be an offering that he will accept—an offering made holy by the Holy Spirit .
ERV	Romans	15	17	That is why I feel so good about what I have done for God in my service to Christ Jesus .
ERV	Romans	15	18	I will not talk about anything I did myself . I will talk only about what Christ has done with me in leading the non-Jewish people to obey God . They have obeyed him because of what I have said and done .
ERV	Romans	15	19	And they obeyed him because of the power of the miraculous signs and wonders that happened—all because of the power of God ’ s Spirit . I have told people the Good News about Christ in every place from Jerusalem to Illyricum . And so I have finished that part of my work .
ERV	Romans	15	20	I always want to tell the Good News in places where people have never heard of Christ . I do this because I don ’ t want to build on the work that someone else has already started .
ERV	Romans	15	21	But as the Scriptures say , “ Those who were not told about him will see , and those who have not heard about him will understand. ” ( E ) Paul ’ s Plan to Visit Rome
ERV	Romans	15	22	That ’ s what has kept me so busy and prevented my coming to see you even though I have wanted to come many times .
ERV	Romans	15	23	Now I have finished my work in these areas . And for many years I have wanted to visit you .
ERV	Romans	15	24	So I will visit you when I go to Spain . Yes , I hope to visit you while I am traveling to Spain , and I will stay and enjoy being with you . Then you can help me continue on my trip .
ERV	Romans	15	25	Now I am going to Jerusalem to help God ’ s people there .
ERV	Romans	15	26	Some of them are poor , and the believers in Macedonia and Achaia wanted to help them . So they gathered some money to send them .
ERV	Romans	15	27	They were happy to do this . And it was like paying something they owed them , because as non-Jews they have been blessed spiritually by the Jews . So now they should use the material blessings they have to help the Jews .
ERV	Romans	15	28	I am going to Jerusalem to make sure the poor get this money that has been given for them . After I finish that , I will leave for Spain and stop to visit you on the way .
ERV	Romans	15	29	And I know that when I visit you , I will bring you Christ ’ s full blessing .
ERV	Romans	15	30	Brothers and sisters , I beg you to help me in my work by praying to God for me . Do this because of our Lord Jesus and the love that the Spirit gives us .
ERV	Romans	15	31	Pray that I will be saved from those in Judea who refuse to accept our message . And pray that this help I am bringing to Jerusalem will please God ’ s people there .
ERV	Romans	15	32	Then , if God wants me to , I will come to you . I will come with joy , and together you and I will have a time of rest .

ERV	Romans	16	18	People like that are not serving our Lord Christ . They are only pleasing themselves . They use fancy talk and say nice things to fool those who don ’ t know about evil .
ERV	Romans	16	19	Everyone has heard that you do what you were taught , and I am very happy about that . But I want you to be wise about what is good and to know nothing about what is evil .

ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	3	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Paul Gives Thanks to God
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I always thank my God for you because of the grace that he has given you through Christ Jesus .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	5	In him you have been blessed in every way . You have been blessed in all your speaking and all your knowledge .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	6	This proves that what we told you about Christ is true .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	7	Now you have every gift from God while you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to come again .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	8	He will keep you strong until the end so that on the day when our Lord Jesus Christ comes , you will be free from all blame .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful . He is the one who has chosen you to share life with his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord . Stop Arguing With Each Other
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	10	Brothers and sisters , by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ , I beg all of you to agree with each other . You should not be divided into different groups . Be completely joined together again with the same kind of thinking and the same purpose .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	11	My brothers and sisters , some members of Chloe ’ s family told me that there are arguments among you .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	12	This is what I mean : One of you says , “ I follow Paul , ” and someone else says , “ I follow Apollos. ” Another says , “ I follow Peter , ” [ b ] and someone else says , “ I follow Christ. ”
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	13	Christ can not be divided into different groups . It wasn ’ t Paul who died on the cross for you , was it ? Were you baptized in Paul ’ s name ?
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	15	I am thankful because now no one can say that you were baptized in my name .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	16	( I also baptized the family of Stephanas , but I don ’ t remember that I myself baptized any others . )
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	17	Christ did not give me the work of baptizing people . He gave me the work of telling the Good News . But he sent me to tell the Good News without using clever speech , which would take away the power that is in the cross [ c ] of Christ . God ’ s Power and Wisdom in Christ Jesus
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	18	The teaching about the cross seems foolish to those who are lost . But to us who are being saved it is the power of God .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	19	As the Scriptures say , “ I will destroy the wisdom of the wise . I will confuse the understanding of the intelligent. ” ( A )
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	20	So what does this say about the philosopher , the law expert , or anyone in this world who is skilled in making clever arguments ? God has made the wisdom of the world look foolish .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	21	This is what God in his wisdom decided : Since the world did not find him through its own wisdom , he used the message that sounds foolish to save those who believe it .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	22	The Jews ask for miraculous signs , and the Greeks want wisdom .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	23	But this is the message we tell everyone : Christ was killed on a cross . This message is a problem for Jews , and to other people it is nonsense .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	24	But Christ is God ’ s power and wisdom to the people God has chosen , both Jews and Greeks .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	25	Even the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom . Even the weakness of God is stronger than human strength .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	26	Brothers and sisters , God chose you to be his . Think about that ! Not many of you were wise in the way the world judges wisdom . Not many of you had great influence , and not many of you came from important families .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	27	But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise . He chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	28	And God chose what the world thinks is not important—what the world hates and thinks is nothing . He chose these to destroy what the world thinks is important .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	29	God did this so that no one can stand before him and boast about anything .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	30	It is God who has made you part of Christ Jesus . And Christ has become for us wisdom from God . He is the reason we are right with God and pure enough to be in his presence . Christ is the one who set us free from sin .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	1	31	So , as the Scriptures say , “ Whoever boasts should boast only about the Lord. ” [ d ] Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Corinthians	2	1	Corinthians
ERV	1%20Corinthians	2	2	I decided that while I was with you I would forget about everything except Jesus Christ and his death on the cross .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	2	3	When I came to you , I was weak and shook with fear .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	2	4	My teaching and my speaking were not with wise words that persuade people . But the proof of my teaching was the power that the Spirit gives .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	2	5	I did this so that your faith would be in God ’ s power , not in human wisdom . God ’ s Wisdom
ERV	1%20Corinthians	2	6	We teach wisdom to people who are mature , but the wisdom we teach is not from this world . It is not the wisdom of the rulers of this world , who are losing their power .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	2	7	But we speak God ’ s secret wisdom that has been hidden from everyone until now . God planned this wisdom for our glory . He planned it before the world began .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	2	8	None of the rulers of this world understood this wisdom . If they had understood it , they would not have killed our great and glorious Lord on a cross .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	2	9	But as the Scriptures say , “ No one has ever seen , no one has ever heard , no one has ever imagined what God has prepared for those who love him. ” ( A )
ERV	1%20Corinthians	2	10	But God has shown us these things through the Spirit . The Spirit knows all things . The Spirit even knows the deep secrets of God .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	2	11	It is like this : No one knows the thoughts that another person has . Only the person ’ s spirit that lives inside knows those thoughts . It is the same with God . No one knows God ’ s thoughts except God ’ s Spirit .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	2	12	We received the Spirit that is from God , not the spirit of the world . We received God ’ s Spirit so that we can know all that God has given us .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	2	13	When we say this , we don ’ t use words taught to us by human wisdom . We use words taught to us by the Spirit . We use the Spirit ’ s words to explain spiritual truths .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	2	14	People who do not have God ’ s Spirit do not accept the things that come from his Spirit . They think these things are foolish . They can not understand them , because they can only be understood with the Spirit ’ s help .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	2	15	We who have the Spirit are able to make judgments about all these things . But anyone without the Spirit is not able to make proper judgments about us .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	2	16	As the Scriptures say , “ Who can know what is on the Lord ’ s mind ? Who is able to give him advice ? ” ( B ) But we have been given Christ ’ s way of thinking .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	1	Corinthians 3:20 Quote from Ps . 94:11 .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	3	You are still not following the Spirit . You are jealous of each other , and you are always arguing with each other . This shows that you are still following your own selfish desires . You are acting like ordinary people of the world .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	2	And the teaching I gave you was like milk , not solid food . I did this because you were not ready for solid food . And even now you are not ready .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	4	One of you says , “ I follow Paul , ” and someone else says , “ I follow Apollos. ” When you say things like that , you are acting like people of the world .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	5	Is Apollos so important ? Is Paul so important ? We are only servants of God who helped you believe . Each one of us did the work God gave us to do .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	6	I planted the seed and Apollos watered it . But God is the one who made the seed grow .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So the one who plants is not important , and the one who waters is not important . Only God is important , because he is the one who makes things grow .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	8	The one who plants and the one who waters have the same purpose . And each one will be rewarded for his own work .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	9	We are workers together for God , and you are like a farm that belongs to God . And you are a house that belongs to God .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	10	Like an expert builder I built the foundation of that house . I used the gift that God gave me to do this . Other people are building on that foundation . But everyone should be careful how they build .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	11	The foundation that has already been built is Jesus Christ , and no one can build any other foundation .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	12	People can build on that foundation using gold , silver , jewels , wood , grass , or straw .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	13	But the work that each person does will be clearly seen , because the Day will make it plain . That Day will appear with fire , and the fire will test everyone ’ s work .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If the building they put on the foundation still stands , they will get their reward .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	15	But if their building is burned up , they will suffer loss . They will be saved , but it will be like someone escaping from a fire .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	16	You should know that you yourselves are God ’ s temple . [ a ] God ’ s Spirit lives in you .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If you destroy God ’ s temple , God will destroy you , because God ’ s temple is holy . You yourselves are God ’ s temple .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Don ’ t fool yourselves . Whoever thinks they are wise in this world should become a fool . That ’ s the only way they can be wise .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	19	I say this because the wisdom of this world is foolishness to God . As the Scriptures say , “ He catches those who think they are wise in their own clever traps. ” [ b ]
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	20	The Scriptures also say , “ The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise . He knows that their thoughts are worth nothing. ” [ c ]
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	21	So there is not a person on earth that any of you should be boasting about . Everything is yours :
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	22	Paul , Apollos , Peter , the world , life , death , the present , and the future—all these are yours .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	3	23	And you belong to Christ , and Christ belongs to God . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	1	Corinthians
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	4	I don ’ t know of any wrong I have done , but that does not make me right . The Lord is the one who must decide if I have done well or not .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	2	Those who are trusted with such an important work must show that they are worthy of that trust .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	3	But I don ’ t consider your judgment on this point to be worth anything . Even an opinion from a court of law would mean nothing . I don ’ t even trust my own judgment .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	5	So don ’ t judge anyone now . The time for judging will be when the Lord comes . He will shine light on everything that is now hidden in darkness . He will make known the secret purposes of our hearts . Then the praise each person should get will come from God .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	6	Brothers and sisters , I have used Apollos and myself as examples for you . I did this so that you could learn from us the meaning of the words , “ Follow what the Scriptures say. ” Then you will not brag about one person and criticize another .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	7	Who do you think you are ? Everything you have was given to you . So , if everything you have was given to you , why do you act as if you got it all by your own power ?
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	8	You think you have everything you need . You think you are rich . You think you have become kings without us . I wish you really were kings . Then we could rule together with you .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	9	But it seems to me that God has given me and the other apostles the last place . We are like prisoners condemned to die , led in a parade for the whole world to see—not just people but angels too .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ , but you think you are so wise in Christ . We are weak , but you think you are so strong . People give you honor , but they don ’ t honor us .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	11	Even now we still don ’ t have enough to eat or drink , and we don ’ t have enough clothes . We often get beatings . We have no homes .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	12	We work hard with our own hands to feed ourselves . When people insult us , we ask God to bless them . When people treat us badly , we accept it .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	13	When people say bad things about us , we try to say something that will help them . But people still treat us like the world ’ s garbage—everyone ’ s trash .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I am not trying to make you feel ashamed , but I am writing this to counsel you as my own dear children .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	15	You may have ten thousand teachers in Christ , but you don ’ t have many fathers . Through the Good News I became your father in Christ Jesus .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	16	So I beg you to be like me .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	17	That is why I am sending Timothy to you . He is my son in the Lord . I love him and trust him . He will help you remember the way I live in Christ Jesus—a way of life that I teach in every meeting of the church wherever I am .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	18	Some of you are acting so proud , it seems as though you think I won ’ t be coming there again .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you very soon , the Lord willing . Then I will see if these proud talkers have the power to do anything more than talk .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	20	God ’ s kingdom is not seen in talk but in power .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	4	21	Which do you want : that I come to you with punishment , or that I come with love and gentleness ?
ERV	1%20Corinthians	5	1	Corinthians 5:12 Quote from Deut . 22:21 ,
ERV	1%20Corinthians	5	5	Then turn this man over to Satan . His sinful self [ a ] has to be destroyed so that his spirit will be saved on the day when the Lord comes again .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	5	2	And still you are proud of yourselves ! You should have been filled with sadness . And the man who committed that sin should be put out of your group .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	5	3	I can not be there with you in person , but I am with you in spirit . And I have already judged the man who did this . I judged him the same as I would if I were really there .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	5	4	Come together in the name of our Lord Jesus . I will be with you in spirit , and you will have the power of our Lord Jesus with you .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	5	6	Your proud talk is not good . You know the saying , “ Just a little yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise. ”
ERV	1%20Corinthians	5	7	Take out all the old yeast , so that you will be a new batch of dough . You really are bread without yeast—Passover bread . [ b ] Yes , Christ our Passover Lamb [ c ] has already been killed .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	5	8	So let us eat our Passover meal , but not with the bread that has the old yeast , the yeast of sin and wrongdoing . But let us eat the bread that has no yeast . This is the bread of goodness and truth .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	5	9	I wrote to you in my letter that you should not associate with people who sin sexually .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	5	10	But I did not mean the people of this world . You would have to leave the world to get away from all the people who sin sexually , or who are greedy and cheat each other , or who worship idols .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	5	11	I meant you must not associate with people who claim to be believers but continue to live in sin . Don ’ t even eat with a brother or sister who sins sexually , is greedy , worships idols , abuses others with insults , gets drunk , or cheats people . 12-13 It is not my business to judge those who are not part of the group of believers . God will judge them , but you must judge those who are part of your group . The Scriptures say , “ Make the evil person leave your group. ” [ d ] Footnotes -

ERV	1%20Corinthians	6	1	Corinthians 6:19 temple God ’ s house—the place where God ’ s people worship him . Here , it means that believers are the spiritual temple where God lives .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	6	6	But now one believer goes to court against another , and you let people who are not believers judge their case !
ERV	1%20Corinthians	6	2	Don ’ t you know that God ’ s people will judge the world ? So if you will judge the world , then surely you can judge small arguments like this .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	6	3	You know that in the future we will judge angels . So surely we can judge life ’ s ordinary problems .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	6	4	So if you have such matters to be judged , why do you take them to those who are not part of the church ? They mean nothing to you .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	6	5	I say this to shame you . Surely there is someone in your group wise enough to judge a complaint between two believers .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	6	7	The lawsuits that you have against each other show that you are already defeated . It would be better for you to let someone wrong you . It would be better to let someone cheat you .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	6	8	But you are the ones doing wrong and cheating . And you do this to your own brothers and sisters in Christ ! 9-10 Surely you know that people who do wrong will not get to enjoy God ’ s kingdom . Don ’ t be fooled . These are the people who will not get to enjoy his kingdom : those who sin sexually , those who worship idols , those who commit adultery , men who let other men use them for sex or who have sex with other men , those who steal , those who are greedy , those who drink too much , those who abuse others with insults , and those who cheat .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	6	11	In the past some of you were like that . But you were washed clean , you were made holy , and you were made right with God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God . Use Your Bodies for God ’ s Glory
ERV	1%20Corinthians	6	12	“ I am allowed to do anything , ” you say . My answer to this is that not all things are good . Even if it is true that “ I am allowed to do anything , ” I will not let anything control me like a slave .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	6	13	Someone else says , “ Food is for the stomach , and the stomach for food. ” Yes , and God will destroy them both . But the body is not for sexual sin . The body is for the Lord , and the Lord is for the body .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	6	14	And God will raise our bodies from death with the same power he used to raise the Lord Jesus .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	6	15	Surely you know that your bodies are parts of Christ himself . So I must never take what is part of Christ and join it to a prostitute !
ERV	1%20Corinthians	6	16	The Scriptures say , “ The two people will become one. ” [ a ] So you should know that anyone who is joined with a prostitute becomes one with her in body .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	6	17	But anyone who is joined with the Lord is one with him in spirit .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	6	18	So run away from sexual sin . It involves the body in a way that no other sin does . So if you commit sexual sin , you are sinning against your own body .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	6	19	You should know that your body is a temple [ b ] for the Holy Spirit that you received from God and that lives in you . You don ’ t own yourselves .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	6	20	God paid a very high price to make you his . So honor God with your body . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	1	Corinthians 7:36 She … to marry Or “ He may have trouble controlling his desires . ”
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	7	I wish everyone could be like me . But God has given each person a different ability . He makes some able to live one way , others to live a different way .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	2	But sexual sin is a danger , so each man should enjoy his own wife , and each woman should enjoy her own husband .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	3	The husband should give his wife what she deserves as his wife . And the wife should give her husband what he deserves as her husband .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	4	The wife does not have power over her own body . Her husband has the power over her body . And the husband does not have power over his own body . His wife has the power over his body .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	5	Don ’ t refuse to give your bodies to each other . But you might both agree to stay away from sex for a while so that you can give your time to prayer . Then come together again so that Satan will not be able to tempt you in your weakness .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	6	I say this only to give you permission to be separated for a time . It is not a rule .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	8	Now for those who are not married and for the widows I say this : It is good for you to stay single like me .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if you can not control your body , then you should marry . It is better to marry than to burn with sexual desire .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	10	Now , I have a command for those who are married . Actually , it is not from me ; it is what the Lord commanded . A wife should not leave her husband .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	11	But if a wife does leave , she should remain single or get back together with her husband . And a husband should not divorce his wife .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	12	The advice I have for the others is from me . The Lord did not give us any teaching about this . If you have a wife who is not a believer , you should not divorce her if she will continue to live with you .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	13	And if you have a husband who is not a believer , you should not divorce him if he will continue to live with you .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	14	The husband who is not a believer is set apart for God through his believing wife . And the wife who is not a believer is set apart for God through her believing husband . If this were not true , your children would be unfit for God ’ s use . But now they are set apart for him .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	15	But if the husband or wife who is not a believer decides to leave , let them leave . When this happens , the brother or sister in Christ is free . God chose you to have a life of peace .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	16	Wives , maybe you will save your husband ; and husbands , maybe you will save your wife . You don ’ t know now what will happen later . Live as God Called You
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	17	But each one of you should continue to live the way the Lord God has given you to live—the way you were when God chose you . I tell people in all the churches to follow this rule .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	18	If a man was already circumcised when he was chosen , he should not change his circumcision . If a man was without circumcision when he was chosen , he should not be circumcised .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	19	It is not important if anyone is circumcised or not . What is important is obeying God ’ s commands .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Each one of you should stay the way you were when God chose you .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	21	If you were a slave when God chose you , don ’ t let that bother you . But if you can be free , then do it .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	22	If you were a slave when the Lord chose you , you are now free in the Lord . You belong to the Lord . In the same way , if you were free when you were chosen , you are now Christ ’ s slave .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	23	God paid a high price for you , so don ’ t be slaves to anyone else .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	24	Brothers and sisters , in your new life with God , each one of you should continue the way you were when God chose you . Questions About Getting Married
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now I write about people who are not married . [ a ] I have no command from the Lord about this , but I give my opinion . And I can be trusted , because the Lord has given me mercy .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	26	This is a time of trouble . So I think it is good for you to stay the way you are .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	27	If you have a wife , don ’ t try to get free from her . If you are not married , don ’ t try to find a wife .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But if you decide to marry , that is not a sin . And it is not a sin for a girl who has never married to get married . But those who marry will have trouble in this life , and I want you to be free from this trouble .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	29	Brothers and sisters , this is what I mean : We don ’ t have much time left . So starting now , those who have wives should be the same as those who don ’ t .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	30	It should not be important whether you are sad or whether you are happy . If you buy something , it should not matter to you that you own it .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	31	You should use the things of the world without letting them become important to you . This is how you should live , because this world , the way it is now , will soon be gone .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	32	I want you to be free from worry . A man who is not married is busy with the Lord ’ s work . He is trying to please the Lord .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	33	But a man who is married is busy with things of the world . He is trying to please his wife .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	34	He must think about two things—pleasing his wife and pleasing the Lord . A woman who is not married or a girl who has never married is busy with the Lord ’ s work . She wants to give herself fully—body and spirit—to the Lord . But a married woman is busy with things of the world . She is trying to please her husband .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	35	I am saying this to help you . I am not trying to limit you , but I want you to live in the right way . And I want you to give yourselves fully to the Lord without giving your time to other things .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	36	A man might think that he is not doing the right thing with his fiancée . She might be almost past the best age to marry . [ b ] So he might feel that he should marry her . He should do what he wants . It is no sin for them to get married .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	37	But another man might be more sure in his mind . There may be no need for marriage , so he is free to do what he wants . If he has decided in his own heart not to marry his fiancée , he is doing the right thing .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	38	So the man who marries his fiancée does right , and the man who does not marry does better .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	39	A woman should stay with her husband as long as he lives . But if the husband dies , the woman is free to marry any man she wants , but he should belong to the Lord .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	7	40	The woman is happier if she does not marry again . This is my opinion , and I believe that I have God ’ s Spirit . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Corinthians	8	1	Corinthians 8:1 sacrificed Killed and offered as a gift to show worship . Also in verse
ERV	1%20Corinthians	8	8	But food will not bring us closer to God . Refusing to eat does not make us less pleasing to God , and eating does not make us closer to him .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	8	2	Those who think they know something do not yet know anything as they should .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	8	3	But whoever loves God is known by God .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	8	4	So this is what I say about eating meat : We know that an idol is really nothing in the world , and we know that there is only one God .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	8	5	It ’ s really not important if there are things called gods in heaven or on earth—and there are many of these “ gods ” and “ lords ” out there .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	8	6	For us there is only one God , and he is our Father . All things came from him , and we live for him . And there is only one Lord , Jesus Christ . All things were made through him , and we also have life through him .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	8	7	But not all people know this . Some have had the habit of worshiping idols . So now when they eat meat , they still feel as if it belongs to an idol . They are not sure that it is right to eat this meat . So when they eat it , they feel guilty .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	8	9	But be careful with your freedom . Your freedom to eat anything may make those who have doubts about what they can eat fall into sin .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	8	10	.
ERV	1%20Corinthians	8	11	So this weak brother or sister—someone Christ died for—is lost because of your better understanding .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	8	12	When you sin against your brothers and sisters in Christ in this way and you hurt them by causing them to do things they feel are wrong , you are also sinning against Christ .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	8	13	So if the food I eat makes another believer fall into sin , I will never eat meat again . I will stop eating meat , so that I will not make my brother or sister sin . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	1	Corinthians 9:9 Quote from Deut . 25:4 .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	9	Yes , it is written in the Law of Moses : “ When a work animal is being used to separate grain , don ’ t keep it from eating the grain. ” [ a ] When God said this , was he thinking only about work animals ? No .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	2	Others may not accept me as an apostle , but surely you do . You are proof that I am an apostle in the Lord .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	3	Some people want to judge me . So this is the answer I give them :
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	4	We have the right to eat and drink , don ’ t we ?
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	5	We have the right to bring a believing wife with us when we travel , don ’ t we ? The other apostles and the Lord ’ s brothers and Peter all do this .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	6	And are Barnabas and I the only ones who must work to earn our living ?
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	7	No soldier ever serves in the army and pays his own salary . No one ever plants a vineyard without eating some of the grapes himself . No one takes care of a flock of sheep without drinking some of the milk himself .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	8	These aren ’ t just my own thoughts . God ’ s law says the same thing .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	10	He was really talking about us . Yes , that was written for us . The one who plows and the one who separates the grain should both expect to get some of the grain for their work .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	11	We planted spiritual seed among you , so we should be able to harvest from you some things for this life . Surely that is not asking too much .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	12	Others have this right to get things from you . So surely we have this right too . But we don ’ t use this right . No , we endure everything ourselves so that we will not stop anyone from obeying the Good News of Christ .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	13	Surely you know that those who work at the Temple get their food from the Temple . And those who serve at the altar get part of what is offered at the altar .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	14	It is the same with those who have the work of telling the Good News . The Lord has commanded that those who tell the Good News should get their living from this work .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But I have not used any of these rights , and I am not trying to get anything from you . That is not my purpose for writing this . I would rather die than to have someone take away what for me is a great source of pride .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	16	It ’ s not my work of telling the Good News that gives me any reason to boast . That is my duty—something I must do . If I don ’ t tell people the Good News , I am in real trouble .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	17	If I did it because it was my own choice , I would deserve to be paid . But I have no choice . I must tell the Good News . So I am only doing the duty that was given to me .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	18	So what do I get for doing it ? My reward is that when I tell people the Good News I can offer it to them for free and not use the rights that come with doing this work .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	19	I am free . I belong to no other person , but I make myself a slave to everyone . I do this to help save as many people as I can .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	20	To the Jews I became like a Jew so that I could help save Jews . I myself am not ruled by the law , but to those who are ruled by the law I became like someone who is ruled by the law . I did this to help save those who are ruled by the law .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	21	To those who are without the law I became like someone who is without the law . I did this to help save those who are without the law . ( But really , I am not without God ’ s law—I am ruled by the law of Christ . )
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	22	To those who are weak , I became weak so that I could help save them . I have become all things to all people . I did this so that I could save people in any way possible .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	23	I do all this to make the Good News known . I do it so that I can share in the blessings of the Good News .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	24	You know that in a race all the runners run , but only one runner gets the prize . So run like that . Run to win !
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	25	All who compete in the games use strict training . They do this so that they can win a prize—one that doesn ’ t last . But our prize is one that will last forever .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	26	So I run like someone who has a goal . I fight like a boxer who is hitting something , not just the air .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	9	27	It is my own body I fight to make it do what I want . I do this so that I won ’ t miss getting the prize myself after telling others about it . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	1	Corinthians 10:26 Quote from Ps . 24:1 ; 50:12 ; 89:11 .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	10	And don ’ t complain as some of them did . Because they complained , they were killed by the angel that destroys .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	2	They were all baptized [ b ] into Moses in the cloud and in the sea .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	3	They all ate the same spiritual food ,
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	4	and they all drank the same spiritual drink . They drank from that spiritual rock that was with them , and that rock was Christ .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	5	But God was not pleased with most of those people , so they were killed in the desert .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	6	And these things that happened are examples for us . These examples should stop us from wanting evil things like those people did .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	7	Don ’ t worship idols as some of them did . As the Scriptures say , “ The people sat down to eat and drink and then got up to have a wild party. ” [ c ]
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	8	We should not commit sexual sins as some of them did . In one day 23,000 of them died because of their sin .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	9	We should not test Christ [ d ] as some of them did . Because of that , they were killed by snakes .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	11	The things that happened to those people are examples . They were written to be warnings for us . We live in the time that all those past histories were pointing to .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	12	So anyone who thinks they are standing strong should be careful that they don ’ t fall .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	13	The only temptations that you have are the same temptations that all people have . But you can trust God . He will not let you be tempted more than you can bear . But when you are tempted , God will also give you a way to escape that temptation . Then you will be able to endure it .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	14	So , my dear friends , stay away from worshiping idols .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	15	You are intelligent people . Judge for yourselves the truth of what I say now .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	16	The cup of blessing [ e ] that we give thanks for is a sharing in the blood sacrifice of Christ , isn ’ t it ? And the bread that we break is a sharing in the body of Christ , isn ’ t it ?
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	17	. -
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	18	And think about what the people of Israel do . When they eat the sacrifices , [ f ] they are united by sharing what was offered on the altar .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	19	So , am I saying that sacrifices to idols are the same as those Jewish sacrifices ? No , because an idol is nothing , and the things offered to idols are worth nothing .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	20	. -
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	21	You can not drink the cup of the Lord and then go drink a cup that honors demons . You can not share a meal at the Lord ’ s table and then go share a meal that honors demons .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	22	Doing that would make the Lord jealous . [ g ] Do you really want to do that ? Do you think we are stronger than he is ? Use Your Freedom for God ’ s Glory
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	23	“ All things are allowed , ” you say . But not all things are good . “ All things are allowed. ” But some things don ’ t help anyone .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	24	Try to do what is good for others , not just what is good for yourselves .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	25	Eat any meat that is sold in the meat market . Don ’ t ask questions about it to see if it is something you think is wrong to eat .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	26	You can eat it , “ because the earth and everything in it belong to the Lord. ” [ h ]
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	27	Someone who is not a believer might invite you to eat with them . If you want to go , then eat anything that is put before you . Don ’ t ask questions to see if it is something you think is wrong to eat .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	28	But if someone tells you , “ That food was offered to idols , ” then don ’ t eat it . That ’ s because some people think it is wrong , and it might cause a problem for the person who told you that .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	29	I don ’ t mean that you think it is wrong . But the other person might think it is wrong . That ’ s the only reason not to eat it . My own freedom should not be judged by what another person thinks .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	30	I eat the meal with thankfulness . So I don ’ t want to be criticized because of something I thank God for .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	31	So if you eat , or if you drink , or if you do anything , do it for the glory of God .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	32	Never do anything that might make other people do wrong—Jews , non-Jews , or anyone in God ’ s church .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	10	33	I do the same thing . I try to please everyone in every way . I am not trying to do what is good for me . I am trying to do what is good for the most people so that they can be saved . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	1	Corinthians 11:21 have too much Literally , “ get drunk . ”
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	11	But in the Lord the woman needs the man , and the man needs the woman .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	2	I praise you because you remember me in all things . You follow closely the teachings I gave you .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	3	But I want you to understand this : The head of every man is Christ . And the head of a woman is the man . [ a ] And the head of Christ is God .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	4	Every man who prophesies or prays with his head covered brings shame to his head .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	5	But every woman who prays or prophesies should have her head covered . If her head is not covered , she brings shame to her head . Then she is the same as a woman who has her head shaved .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	6	If a woman does not cover her head , it is the same as cutting off all her hair . But it is shameful for a woman to cut off her hair or to shave her head . So she should cover her head .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	7	But a man should not cover his head , because he is made like God and is God ’ s glory . But woman is man ’ s glory .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	8	Man did not come from woman . Woman came from man .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	9	And man was not made for woman . Woman was made for man .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	10	So that is why a woman should have her head covered with something that shows she is under authority . [ b ] Also , she should do this because of the angels .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	12	This is true because woman came from man , but also man is born from woman . Really , everything comes from God .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	13	Decide this for yourselves : Is it right for a woman to pray to God without something on her head ?
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	14	Even nature itself teaches you that wearing long hair is shameful for a man .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	15	But wearing long hair is a woman ’ s honor . Long hair is given to the woman to cover her head .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	16	Some people may still want to argue about this . But we and the churches of God don ’ t accept what those people are doing . The Lord ’ s Supper
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	17	In the things I tell you now I don ’ t praise you . Your meetings hurt you more than they help you .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	18	First , I hear that when you meet together as a church you are divided . And this is not hard to believe
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	19	because of your idea that you must have separate groups to show who the real believers are !
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	20	When you all come together , it is not really the Lord ’ s Supper [ c ] you are eating .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	21	I say this because when you eat , each one eats without waiting for the others . Some people don ’ t get enough to eat or drink , while others have too much . [ d ]
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	22	You can eat and drink in your own homes . It seems that you think God ’ s church is not important . You embarrass those who are poor . What can I say ? Should I praise you ? No , I can not praise you for this .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	23	The teaching I gave you is the same that I received from the Lord : On the night when the Lord Jesus was handed over to be killed , he took bread
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	24	and gave thanks for it . Then he divided the bread and said , “ This is my body ; it is for you . Eat this to remember me. ”
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	25	In the same way , after they ate , Jesus took the cup of wine . He said , “ This cup represents the new agreement from God , which begins with my blood sacrifice . When you drink this , do it to remember me. ”
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	26	This means that every time you eat this bread and drink this cup , you are telling others about the Lord ’ s death until he comes again .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	27	So if you eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in a way that does not fit its meaning , you are sinning against the body and the blood of the Lord .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	28	Before you eat the bread and drink the cup , you should examine your own attitude .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	29	If you eat and drink without paying attention to those who are the Lord ’ s body , your eating and drinking will cause you to be judged guilty .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	30	That is why many in your group are sick and weak , and many have died .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	31	But if we judged ourselves in the right way , then God would not judge us .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	32	But when the Lord judges us , he punishes us to show us the right way . He does this so that we will not be condemned with the world .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	33	So , my brothers and sisters , when you come together to eat , wait for each other .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	11	34	If some are too hungry to wait , they should eat at home . Do this so that your meeting together will not bring God ’ s judgment on you . I will tell you what to do about the other things when I come . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	1	Corinthians 12:13 given Literally , “ given to drink . ”
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	12	A person has only one body , but it has many parts . Yes , there are many parts , but all those parts are still just one body . Christ is like that too .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	2	You remember the lives you lived before you were believers . You let yourselves be influenced and led away to worship idols—things that have no life .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	3	So I tell you that no one who is speaking with the help of God ’ s Spirit says , “ Jesus be cursed. ” And no one can say , “ Jesus is Lord , ” without the help of the Holy Spirit .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	4	There are different kinds of spiritual gifts , but they are all from the same Spirit .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	5	There are different ways to serve , but we serve the same Lord .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	6	And there are different ways that God works in people , but it is the same God who works in all of us to do everything .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	7	Something from the Spirit can be seen in each person . The Spirit gives this to each one to help others .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	8	The Spirit gives one person the ability to speak with wisdom . And the same Spirit gives another person the ability to speak with knowledge .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	9	The same Spirit gives faith to one person and to another he gives gifts of healing .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	10	The Spirit gives to one person the power to do miracles , to another the ability to prophesy , and to another the ability to judge what is from the Spirit and what is not . The Spirit gives one person the ability to speak in different kinds of languages , and to another the ability to interpret those languages .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	11	One Spirit , the same Spirit , does all these things . The Spirit decides what to give each one . The Body of Christ
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	13	Some of us are Jews and some of us are not ; some of us are slaves and some of us are free . But we were all baptized to become one body through one Spirit . And we were all given [ a ] the one Spirit .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	14	And a person ’ s body has more than one part . It has many parts .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	15	The foot might say , “ I am not a hand , so I don ’ t belong to the body. ” But saying this would not stop the foot from being a part of the body .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	16	The ear might say , “ I am not an eye , so I don ’ t belong to the body. ” But saying this would not make the ear stop being a part of the body .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye , it would not be able to hear . If the whole body were an ear , it would not be able to smell anything . 18-19 If each part of the body were the same part , there would be no body . But as it is , God put the parts in the body as he wanted them . He made a place for each one .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	20	So there are many parts , but only one body .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	21	The eye can not say to the hand , “ I don ’ t need you ! ” And the head can not say to the foot , “ I don ’ t need you ! ”
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	22	No , those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are actually very important .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	23	And the parts that we think are not worth very much are the parts we give the most care to . And we give special care to the parts of the body that we don ’ t want to show .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	24	The more beautiful parts don ’ t need this special care . But God put the body together and gave more honor to the parts that need it .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	25	God did this so that our body would not be divided . God wanted the different parts to care the same for each other .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	26	If one part of the body suffers , then all the other parts suffer with it . Or if one part is honored , then all the other parts share its honor .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	27	All of you together are the body of Christ . Each one of you is a part of that body .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	28	And in the church God has given a place first to apostles , second to prophets , and third to teachers . Then God has given a place to those who do miracles , those who have gifts of healing , those who can help others , those who are able to lead , and those who can speak in different kinds of languages .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	29	Not all are apostles . Not all are prophets . Not all are teachers . Not all do miracles .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	30	Not all have gifts of healing . Not all speak in different kinds of languages . Not all interpret those languages .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	12	31	Continue to give your attention to the spiritual gifts you consider to be the greatest . But now I want to point out a way of life that is even greater . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Corinthians	13	1	Corinthians
ERV	1%20Corinthians	13	13	So these three things continue : faith , hope , and love . And the greatest of these is love .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	13	2	I may have the gift of prophecy , I may understand all secrets and know everything there is to know , and I may have faith so great that I can move mountains . But even with all this , if I don ’ t have love , I am nothing .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	13	3	I may give away everything I have to help others , and I may even give my body as an offering to be burned . But I gain nothing by doing all this if I don ’ t have love .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	13	4	Love is patient and kind . Love is not jealous , it does not brag , and it is not proud .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	13	5	Love is not rude , it is not selfish , and it can not be made angry easily . Love does not remember wrongs done against it .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	13	6	Love is never happy when others do wrong , but it is always happy with the truth .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	13	7	Love never gives up on people . It never stops trusting , never loses hope , and never quits .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	13	8	Love will never end . But all those gifts will come to an end—even the gift of prophecy , the gift of speaking in different kinds of languages , and the gift of knowledge .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	13	9	These will all end because this knowledge and these prophecies we have are not complete .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	13	10	But when perfection comes , the things that are not complete will end .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I talked like a child , I thought like a child , and I made plans like a child . When I became a man , I stopped those childish ways .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	13	12	It is the same with us . Now we see God as if we are looking at a reflection in a mirror . But then , in the future , we will see him right before our eyes . Now I know only a part , but at that time I will know fully , as God has known me .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	1	Corinthians 14:25 See Isa . 45:14 and Zech . 8:23 .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	14	If I pray in a different language , my spirit is praying , but my mind does nothing .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	2	I will explain why . Those who have the gift of speaking in a different language are not speaking to people . They are speaking to God . No one understands them—they are speaking secret things through the Spirit .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But those who prophesy are speaking to people . They help people grow stronger in faith , and they give encouragement and comfort .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	4	Those who speak in a different language are helping only themselves . But those who prophesy are helping the whole church .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	5	I would like all of you to have the gift of speaking in different languages . But what I want more is for you to prophesy . Anyone who prophesies is more important than those who can only speak in different languages . However , if they can also interpret those languages , they are as important as the one who prophesies . If they can interpret , then the church can be helped by what they say .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	6	Brothers and sisters , will it help you if I come to you speaking in different languages ? No , it will help you only if I bring you a new truth or some knowledge , prophecy , or teaching .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	7	This is true even with lifeless things that make sounds—like a flute or a harp . If the different musical notes are not made clear , you can ’ t understand what song is being played . Each note must be played clearly for you to be able to understand the tune .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	8	And in a war , if the trumpet does not sound clearly , the soldiers will not know it is time to prepare for fighting .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	9	It is the same with you . If you don ’ t speak clearly in a language people know , they can not understand what you are saying . You will be talking to the air !
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	10	It is true that there are many different languages in the world , and they all have meaning .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	11	But if I don ’ t understand the meaning of what someone is saying , it will just be strange sounds to me , and I will sound just as strange to them .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	12	That ’ s why you who want spiritual gifts so much should prefer those gifts that help the church grow stronger .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	13	So those who have the gift of speaking in a different language should pray that they can also interpret what they say .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	15	So what should I do ? I will pray with my spirit , but I will also pray with my mind . I will sing with my spirit , but I will also sing with my mind .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	16	You might be praising God with your spirit . But someone there without understanding can not say “ Amen ” to your prayer of thanks , because they don ’ t know what you are saying .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	17	You may be thanking God in a good way , but others are not helped .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I thank God that my gift of speaking in different kinds of languages is greater than any of yours .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	19	But in the church meetings I would rather speak five words that I understand than thousands of words in a different language . I would rather speak with my understanding , so that I can teach others .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	20	Brothers and sisters , don ’ t think like children . In evil things be like babies , but in your thinking you should be like full-grown adults .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	21	As the Scriptures [ a ] say , “ Using those who speak a different language and using the lips of foreigners , I will speak to these people . But even then , they will not obey me. ” ( A ) This is what the Lord says .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	22	And from this we see that the use of different languages shows how God deals with those who don ’ t believe , not with those who believe . And prophecy shows how God works through those who believe , not through unbelievers .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	23	Suppose the whole church meets together and you all speak in different languages . If some people come in who are without understanding or don ’ t believe , they will say you are crazy .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But suppose you are all prophesying and someone comes in who does not believe or who is without understanding . Their sin will be shown to them , and they will be judged by everything you say .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	25	The secret things in their heart will be made known . So they will bow down and worship God . They will say , “ Without a doubt , God is here with you. ” [ b ] Your Meetings Should Be Helpful to All
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	26	So , brothers and sisters , what should you do ? When you meet together , one person has a song , another has a teaching , and another has a new truth from God . One person speaks in a different language , and another interprets that language . The purpose of whatever you do should be to help everyone grow stronger in faith .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	27	When you meet together , if anyone speaks to the group in a different language , it should be only two or no more than three people who do this . And they should speak one after the other . And someone else should interpret what they say .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	28	But if there is no interpreter , then anyone who speaks in a different language should be quiet in the church meeting . They should speak only to themselves and to God .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	29	And only two or three prophets should speak . The others should judge what they say .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	30	And if a message from God comes to someone who is sitting , the first speaker should be quiet .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	31	You can all prophesy one after the other . This way everyone can be taught and encouraged .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	32	The spirits of prophets are under the control of the prophets themselves .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	33	God is not a God of confusion but a God of peace . This is the rule for all the meetings of God ’ s people .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	34	The women should keep quiet in these church meetings . They are not allowed to speak out but should be under authority , as the Law of Moses says .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	35	If there is something they want to know , they should ask their own husbands at home . It is shameful for a woman to speak up like that in the church meeting .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	36	God ’ s teaching did not come from you , and you are not the only ones who have received it .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	37	If you think you are a prophet or that you have a spiritual gift , you should understand that what I am writing to you is the Lord ’ s command .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	38	If you do not accept this , you will not be accepted .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	39	So my brothers and sisters , continue to give your attention to prophesying . And don ’ t stop anyone from using the gift of speaking in different languages .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	14	40	But everything should be done in a way that is right and orderly . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	1	Corinthians 15:45 Adam The name Adam means “ man. ” Here , “ the last Adam ” refers to Christ , the “ man of heaven . ”
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	15	And we will also be guilty of lying about God , because we have told people about him , saying that he raised Christ from death . And if no one is raised from death , then God never raised Christ from death .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	2	That Good News , the message you heard from me , is God ’ s way to save you . But you must continue believing it . If you don ’ t , you believed for nothing .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	3	I gave you the message that I received . I told you the most important truths : that Christ died for our sins , as the Scriptures say ;
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	4	that he was buried and was raised to life on the third day , as the Scriptures say ;
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	5	and that he appeared to Peter and then to the twelve apostles .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	6	After that Christ appeared to more than
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	500	other believers at the same time . Most of them are still living today , but some have died .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	7	Then he appeared to James and later to all the apostles .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	8	Last of all , he appeared to me . I was different , like a baby born before the normal time .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	9	All the other apostles are greater than I am . I say this because I persecuted the church of God . That is why I am not even good enough to be called an apostle .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But , because of God ’ s grace , that is what I am . And his grace that he gave me was not wasted . I worked harder than all the other apostles . ( But I was not really the one working . It was God ’ s grace that was with me . )
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	11	So then it is not important if I told you God ’ s message or if it was the other apostles who told you—we all tell people the same message , and this is what you believed . We Will Be Raised From Death
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	12	We tell everyone that Christ was raised from death . So why do some of you say that people will not be raised from death ?
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	13	If no one will ever be raised from death , then Christ has never been raised .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ has never been raised , then the message we tell is worth nothing . And your faith is worth nothing .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	16	If those who have died are not raised , then Christ has not been raised either .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	17	And if Christ has not been raised from death , then your faith is for nothing ; you are still guilty of your sins .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	18	And those in Christ who have already died are lost .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If our hope in Christ is only for this life here on earth , then people should feel more sorry for us than for anyone else .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But Christ really has been raised from death—the first one of all those who will be raised .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	21	Death comes to people because of what one man did . But now there is resurrection from death because of another man .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	22	I mean that in Adam all of us die . And in the same way , in Christ all of us will be made alive again .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	23	But everyone will be raised to life in the right order . Christ was first to be raised . Then , when Christ comes again , those who belong to him will be raised to life .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	24	Then the end will come . Christ will destroy all rulers , authorities , and powers . Then he will give the kingdom to God the Father .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	25	Christ must rule until God puts all enemies under his control . [ a ]
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy to be destroyed will be death .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	27	As the Scriptures say , “ God put everything under his control. ” [ b ] When it says that “ everything ” is put under him , it is clear that this does not include God himself . God is the one putting everything under Christ ’ s control .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	28	After everything has been put under Christ , then the Son himself will be put under God . God is the one who put everything under Christ . And Christ will be put under God so that God will be the complete ruler over everything .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	29	If no one will ever be raised from death , then what will the people do who are baptized for those who have died ? If the dead are never raised , then why are people baptized for them ?
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	30	And what about us ? Why do we put ourselves in danger every hour ?
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	31	I face death every day . That is true , brothers and sisters , just as it is true that I am proud of what you are because of Christ Jesus our Lord .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	32	I fought wild animals in Ephesus . If I did that only for human reasons , then I have gained nothing . If we are not raised from death , “ Let us eat and drink , because tomorrow we die. ” [ c ]
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Don ’ t be fooled : “ Bad friends will ruin good habits. ”
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	34	Come back to your right way of thinking and stop sinning . Some of you don ’ t know God . I say this to shame you . What Kind of Body Will We Have ?
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But someone may ask , “ How are the dead raised ? What kind of body will they have ? ”
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	36	These are stupid questions . When you plant something , it must die in the ground before it can live and grow .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	37	And when you plant something , what you plant does not have the same “ body ” that it will have later . What you plant is only a seed , maybe wheat or something else .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	38	But God gives it the body that he has planned for it , and he gives each kind of seed its own body .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	39	All things made of flesh are not the same : People have one kind of flesh , animals have another , birds have another , and fish have yet another kind .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	40	Also there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies . But the beauty of the heavenly bodies is one kind , and the beauty of the earthly bodies is another .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	41	The sun has one kind of beauty , the moon has another kind , and the stars have another . And each star is different in its beauty .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	42	It will be the same when those who have died are raised to life . The body that is “ planted ” in the grave will ruin and decay , but it will be raised to a life that can not be destroyed .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	43	When the body is “ planted , ” it is without honor . But when it is raised , it will be great and glorious . When the body is “ planted , ” it is weak . But when it is raised , it will be full of power .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	44	The body that is “ planted ” is a physical body . When it is raised , it will be a spiritual body . There is a physical body . So there is also a spiritual body .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	45	As the Scriptures say , “ The first man , Adam , became a living person . [ d ] ” [ e ] But the last Adam [ f ] is a life-giving spirit .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	46	The spiritual man did not come first . It was the physical man that came first ; then came the spiritual .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man came from the dust of the earth . The second man came from heaven .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	48	All people belong to the earth . They are like that first man of earth . But those who belong to heaven are like that man of heaven .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	49	We were made like that man of earth , so we will also be made like that man of heaven .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	50	I tell you this , brothers and sisters : Our bodies of flesh and blood can not have a part in God ’ s kingdom . Something that will ruin can not have a part in something that never ruins .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	51	But listen , I tell you this secret : We will not all die , but we will all be changed .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	52	It will only take the time of a second . We will be changed as quickly as an eye blinks . This will happen when the last trumpet blows . The trumpet will blow and those who have died will be raised to live forever . And we will all be changed .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	53	This body that ruins must clothe itself with something that will never ruin . And this body that dies must clothe itself with something that will never die .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	54	So this body that ruins will clothe itself with that which never ruins . And this body that dies will clothe itself with that which never dies . When this happens , the Scriptures will be made true : “ Death is swallowed in victory. ” ( A )
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	55	“ O death , where is your victory ? Where is your power to hurt ? ” ( B )
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	56	Death ’ s power to hurt is sin , and the power of sin is the law .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	57	But we thank God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ !
ERV	1%20Corinthians	15	58	So , my dear brothers and sisters , stand strong . Don ’ t let anything change you . Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord . You know that your work in the Lord is never wasted . Footnotes -

ERV	1%20Corinthians	16	2	On the first day of every week , each of you should take some of your money and put it in a special place . Save up as much as you can from what you are blessed with . Then you will not have to gather it all after I come .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	16	3	When I arrive , I will send some men to take your gift to Jerusalem . These will be the ones you all agree should go . I will send them with letters of introduction .

ERV	1%20Corinthians	16	5	I plan to go through Macedonia , so I will come to you after that .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	16	6	Maybe I will stay with you for a time . I might even stay all winter . Then you can help me on my trip , wherever I go .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	16	7	I don ’ t want to come see you now , because I would have to leave to go to other places . I hope to stay a longer time with you , if the Lord allows it .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	16	8	But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	16	9	I will stay here , because a good opportunity for a great and growing work has been given to me now . And there are many people working against it .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	16	10	Timothy might come to you . Try to make him feel comfortable with you . He is working for the Lord the same as I am .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	16	11	So none of you should refuse to accept Timothy . Help him continue on his trip in peace so that he can come back to me . I am expecting him to come back with the other brothers .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	16	12	Now about our brother Apollos : I strongly encouraged him to visit you with the other brothers . He prefers not to come now , but he will come when he has the opportunity . Paul Ends His Letter
ERV	1%20Corinthians	16	13	Be careful . Hold firmly to your faith . Have courage and be strong .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	16	14	Do everything in love .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	16	15	You know that Stephanas and his family were the first believers in Achaia . They have given themselves to the service of God ’ s people . I ask you , brothers and sisters ,
ERV	1%20Corinthians	16	17	I am happy that Stephanas , Fortunatus , and Achaicus have come . You are not here , but they have filled your place .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	16	18	They have been a great encouragement to me and to you as well . You should recognize the value of such people .
ERV	1%20Corinthians	16	19	The churches in Asia send you their greetings . Aquila and Priscilla greet you in the Lord . Also the church that meets in their house sends greetings .

ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	1	Greetings from Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus . I am an apostle because that is what God wanted . Greetings also from Timothy our brother in Christ . To God ’ s church in Corinth and to all of God ’ s holy people throughout Achaia .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	3	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . He is the Father who is full of mercy , the God of all comfort .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	4	He comforts us every time we have trouble so that when others have trouble , we can comfort them with the same comfort God gives us .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	5	We share in the many sufferings of Christ . In the same way , much comfort comes to us through Christ .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	6	If we have troubles , it is for your comfort and salvation . If we are comforted , it is so that we can comfort you . And this helps you patiently accept the same sufferings we have .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	7	Our hope for you is strong . We know that you share in our sufferings . So we know that you also share in our comfort .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	8	Brothers and sisters , we want you to know about the trouble we suffered in Asia . We had great burdens there , which were greater than our own strength . We even gave up hope for life .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	9	In fact , it seems like God has been telling us we are going to die . But this is so that we will not trust in ourselves but in God , who raises people from death .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	10	He saved us from these great dangers of death , and he will continue to save us . We feel sure he will always save us .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	11	And you can help us with your prayers . Then many people will give thanks for us—that God blessed us because of their many prayers . The Change in Paul ’ s Plans
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	12	This is what we are proud of , and I can say with a clear conscience that it is true : In everything we have done in the world , we have done it with an honest and pure heart from God . And this is even truer in what we have done with you . We did this by God ’ s grace , not by the kind of wisdom the world has .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	13	We write to you only what you can read and understand . And I hope you will fully understand ,
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	14	just as you already understand many things about us . I hope you will understand that you can be proud of us , just as we will be proud of you on the day when our Lord Jesus Christ comes again .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	15	I was very sure of all this . That is why I made plans to visit you first . Then you could be blessed twice .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	16	I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and again on my way back . I wanted to get help from you for my trip to Judea .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	17	Do you think that I made these plans without really thinking ? Or maybe you think I make plans as the world does , saying yes and no at the same time .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	18	But if you can believe God , then you can believe that what we tell you is never both yes and no .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	19	The Son of God , Jesus Christ , the one that Silas , Timothy , and I told you about was not yes and no . In Christ it has always been yes .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	20	The yes to all of God ’ s promises is in Christ . And that is why we say “ Amen ” through Christ to the glory of God .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	21	And God is the one who makes you and us strong in Christ . God is also the one who chose us for his work . [ a ]

ERV	2%20Corinthians	1	23	I tell you this , and I ask God to be my witness that this is true : The reason I did not come back to Corinth was that I did not want to punish or hurt you .

ERV	2%20Corinthians	2	2	If I make you sad , then who will make me happy ? Only you can make me happy—you , the ones I made sad .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	2	3	I wrote you a letter so that when I came to you I would not be made sad by those who should make me happy . I felt sure that all of you would share my joy .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	2	4	When I wrote to you before , I was very troubled and my heart was full of sadness . I wrote with many tears . I did not write to make you sad , but to let you know how much I love you . Forgive the Person Who Did Wrong
ERV	2%20Corinthians	2	5	Someone in your group has caused sadness—not to me , but to all of you . I mean he has caused sadness to all in some way . ( I don ’ t want to make it sound worse than it really is . )
ERV	2%20Corinthians	2	6	The punishment that most of your group gave him is enough for him .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	2	7	But now you should forgive him and encourage him . This will keep him from having too much sadness and giving up completely .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	2	8	So I beg you to show him that you love him .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	2	9	This is why I wrote to you . I wanted to test you and see if you obey in everything .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	2	10	If you forgive someone , then I also forgive them . And what I have forgiven—if I had anything to forgive—I forgave it for you , and Christ was with me .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	2	11	I did this so that Satan would not win anything from us . We know very well what his plans are . God Gives Us Victory Over Troubles
ERV	2%20Corinthians	2	12	I went to Troas to tell people the Good News of Christ . The Lord gave me a good opportunity there .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	2	13	But I had no peace because I did not find my brother Titus . So I said goodbye and went to Macedonia .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	2	14	But thanks be to God , who always leads us in victory through Christ . God uses us to spread his knowledge everywhere like a sweet-smelling perfume .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	2	15	Our offering to God is to be the perfume of Christ that goes out to those who are being saved and to those who are being lost .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	2	16	To those who are being lost , this perfume smells like death , and it brings them death . But to those who are being saved , it has the sweet smell of life , and it brings them life . So who is good enough to do this work ?
ERV	2%20Corinthians	2	17	Certainly not those who are out there selling God ’ s message for a profit ! But we don ’ t do that . With Christ ’ s help we speak God ’ s truth honestly , knowing that we must answer to him .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	3	2	Corinthians 3:14 old agreement See “ agreement ” in the Word List . Here , “ old agreement ” is used to mean the Law of Moses on which that agreement was based .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	3	3	You show that you are a letter from Christ that he sent through us . This letter is not written with ink but with the Spirit of the living God . It is not written on stone [ a ] tablets but on human hearts .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	3	4	We can say this , because through Christ we feel sure before God .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	3	5	I don ’ t mean that we are able to do anything good ourselves . It is God who makes us able to do all that we do .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	3	6	He made us able to be servants of a new agreement from himself to his people . It is not an agreement of written laws , but it is of the Spirit . The written law brings death , but the Spirit gives life . An Agreement With Greater Glory
ERV	2%20Corinthians	3	7	. See Ex . 24:12 ; 25:16 . -
ERV	2%20Corinthians	3	8	So surely the new agreement that comes from the life-giving Spirit has even more glory .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	3	9	This is what I mean : That old agreement judged people guilty of sin , but it had glory . So surely the new agreement that makes people right with God has much greater glory .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	3	10	That old agreement had glory . But it really loses its glory when it is compared to the much greater glory of the new agreement .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	3	11	If the agreement that was brought to an end came with glory , then the agreement that never ends has much greater glory .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	3	12	We are so sure of this hope that we can speak very openly .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	3	13	We are not like Moses , who put a covering over his face . He covered his face so that the people of Israel would not see it . The glory was disappearing , and Moses did not want them to see it end .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were closed . And even today , when those people read the writings of the old agreement , [ c ] that same covering hides the meaning . That covering has not been removed for them . It is taken away only through Christ .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	3	15	Yes , even today , when they read the Law of Moses , there is a covering over their minds .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	3	16	But when someone changes and follows the Lord , that covering is taken away .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	3	17	The Lord is the Spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is freedom .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	3	18	And our faces are not covered . We all show the Lord ’ s glory , and we are being changed to be like him . This change in us brings more and more glory , which comes from the Lord , who is the Spirit . Footnotes -
ERV	2%20Corinthians	4	2	Corinthians 4:13 Quote from Ps . 116:10 .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	4	4	The ruler [ a ] of this world has blinded the minds of those who don ’ t believe . They can not see the light of the Good News—the message about the divine greatness of Christ . Christ is the one who is exactly like God .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	4	3	The Good News that we tell people may be hidden , but it is hidden only to those who are lost .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	4	5	We don ’ t tell people about ourselves . But we tell people that Jesus Christ is Lord , and we tell them that we are your servants for Jesus .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	4	6	God once said , “ Let light shine out of the darkness ! ” [ b ] And this is the same God who made his light shine in our hearts to let us know that his own divine greatness is seen in the face of Christ .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	4	7	We have this treasure from God , but we are only like clay jars that hold the treasure . This is to show that the amazing power we have is from God , not from us .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	4	8	We have troubles all around us , but we are not defeated . We often don ’ t know what to do , but we don ’ t give up .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	4	9	We are persecuted , but God does not leave us . We are hurt sometimes , but we are not destroyed .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	4	10	So we constantly experience the death of Jesus in our own bodies , but this is so that the life of Jesus can also be seen in our bodies .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	4	11	We are alive , but for Jesus we are always in danger of death , so that the life of Jesus can be seen in our bodies that die .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	4	12	So death is working in us , but the result is that life is working in you .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	4	13	The Scriptures say , “ I believed , so I spoke. ” [ c ] Our faith is like that too . We believe , and so we speak .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	4	14	God raised the Lord Jesus from death , and we know that he will also raise us with Jesus . God will bring us together with you , and we will stand before him .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	4	15	All these things are for you . And so the grace of God is being given to more and more people . This will bring more and more thanks to God for his glory . Living by Faith
ERV	2%20Corinthians	4	16	That is why we never give up . Our physical body is becoming older and weaker , but our spirit inside us is made new every day .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	4	17	We have small troubles for a while now , but these troubles are helping us gain an eternal glory . That eternal glory is much greater than our troubles .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	4	18	So we think about what we can not see , not what we see . What we see lasts only a short time , and what we can not see will last forever . Footnotes -
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	2	Corinthians 5:21 sin Or “ an offering for sin . ”
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	5	This is what God himself made us for . And he has given us the Spirit as the first payment to guarantee the life to come .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	3	It will clothe us and we will not be naked .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	4	While we live in this tent , we have burdens and so we complain . I don ’ t mean that we want to remove this tent , but we want to be clothed with our heavenly home . Then this body that dies will be covered with life .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	6	So we always have confidence . We know that while we live in this body , we are away from the Lord .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	7	We live by what we believe will happen , not by what we can see .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	8	So I say that we have confidence . And we really want to be away from this body and be at home with the Lord .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	9	Our only goal is to always please the Lord , whether we are living here in this body or there with him .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	10	We must all stand before Christ to be judged . Everyone will get what they should . They will be paid for whatever they did—good or bad—when they lived in this earthly body . Helping People Become God ’ s Friends
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	11	We know what it means to fear the Lord , so we try to help people accept the truth . God knows what we really are , and I hope that in your hearts you know us too .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	12	We are not trying to prove ourselves to you again . But we are telling you about ourselves . We are giving you reasons to be proud of us . Then you will have an answer for those who are proud about what can be seen . They don ’ t care about what is in a person ’ s heart .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	13	If we are crazy , it is for God . If we have our right mind , it is for you .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	14	The love of Christ controls us , because we know that one person died for everyone . So all have died .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	15	He died for all so that those who live would not continue to live for themselves . He died for them and was raised from death so that they would live for him .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	16	From this time on we don ’ t think of anyone as the world thinks of people . It is true that in the past we thought of Christ as the world thinks . But we don ’ t think that way now .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	17	When anyone is in Christ , it is a whole new world . [ a ] The old things are gone ; suddenly , everything is new !
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	18	All this is from God . Through Christ , God made peace between himself and us . And God gave us the work of bringing people into peace with him .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	19	I mean that God was in Christ , making peace between the world and himself . In Christ , God did not hold people guilty for their sins . And he gave us this message of peace to tell people .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	20	So we have been sent to speak for Christ . It is like God is calling to people through us . We speak for Christ when we beg you to be at peace with God .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	5	21	Christ had no sin , but God made him become sin [ b ] so that in Christ we could be right with God . Footnotes -
ERV	2%20Corinthians	6	2	Corinthians 6:16 God ’ s temple God ’ s house—the place where God ’ s people worship him . Here , it means that believers are the spiritual temple where God lives .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	6	6	We show that we are God ’ s servants by our pure lives , by our understanding , by our patience , and by our kindness . We show it by the Holy Spirit , by genuine love ,
ERV	2%20Corinthians	6	3	We don ’ t want people to find anything wrong with our work . So we do nothing that will be a problem to others .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	6	4	But in every way we show that we are servants of God . We never give up , even though we face troubles , difficulties , and problems of every kind .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	6	5	We are beaten and thrown into prison . People get upset at us and fight against us . We work hard , and sometimes we get no sleep or food .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	6	7	by speaking the truth , and by depending on God ’ s power . This right way of living has prepared us to defend ourselves against every kind of attack .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	6	8	Some people honor us , but others shame us . Some people say good things about us , but others say bad things . Some people say we are liars , but we speak the truth .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	6	9	To some people we are not known , but we are well known . We seem to be dying , but look ! We continue to live . We are punished , but we are not killed .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	6	10	We have much sadness , but we are always rejoicing . We are poor , but we are making many people rich in faith . We have nothing , but really we have everything .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	6	11	We have spoken freely to you people in Corinth . We have opened our hearts to you .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	6	12	Our feelings of love for you have not stopped . It is you who have stopped your feelings of love for us .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	6	13	I speak to you as if you were my children . Do the same as we have done—open your hearts also . We Are God ’ s Temple
ERV	2%20Corinthians	6	14	You are not the same as those who don ’ t believe . So don ’ t join yourselves to them . Good and evil don ’ t belong together . Light and darkness can not share the same room .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	6	15	How can there be any unity between Christ and the devil [ a ] ? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever ?
ERV	2%20Corinthians	6	16	God ’ s temple [ b ] can not have anything to do with idols , and we are the temple of the living God . As God said , “ I will live with them and walk with them ; I will be their God , and they will be my people. ” ( B )
ERV	2%20Corinthians	6	17	“ So come away from those people and separate yourselves from them , says the Lord . Don ’ t touch anything that is not clean , and I will accept you. ” ( C )

ERV	2%20Corinthians	7	2	Open your hearts to us . We have not done wrong to anyone or caused harm to anyone . And we have not cheated anyone .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	7	7	It was so good to see him , but we were encouraged even more to hear about the encouragement you gave him . He told us that you really want to see me and that you are very sorry for what you did . And he told us how ready and willing you are to help me . When I heard this , I was so much happier .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I do not say this to blame you . I told you before that we love you so much we would live or die with you .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	7	4	I feel that I can tell you anything . I am very proud of you . Even with all the troubles we have had , I am greatly encouraged and feel very happy .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	7	5	When we came into Macedonia , we had no rest . We found trouble all around us . We had fighting on the outside and fear on the inside .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	7	6	But God encourages those who are troubled , and he certainly encouraged us by bringing Titus to us .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	7	8	Even if the letter I wrote you made you sad , I am not sorry I wrote it . I know that letter made you sad , and I was sorry for that . But it made you sad only for a short time .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	7	9	Now I am happy , not because you were made sad , but because your sorrow made you decide to change . That is what God wanted , so you were not hurt by us in any way .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	7	10	The kind of sorrow God wants makes people decide to change their lives . This leads them to salvation , and we can not be sorry for that . But the kind of sorrow the world has will bring death .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	7	11	You had the kind of sorrow God wanted you to have . Now see what that sorrow has brought you : It has made you very serious . It made you want to prove that you were not wrong . It made you angry and afraid . It made you want to see me . It made you care . It made you want the right thing to be done . You proved that you were not guilty in any part of that problem .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	7	12	The main reason I wrote that letter was not because of the one who did the wrong or the one who was hurt . I wrote so that you would realize , before God , how very much you care for us .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	7	13	And that is what was so encouraging to us . We were greatly encouraged , but we were especially pleased to see how happy Titus was . You all made him feel so much better .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	7	14	I had bragged about you to Titus , and you didn ’ t embarrass me . We have always told you the truth , and now what we told Titus about you has been shown to be true .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	7	15	And his love for you is stronger when he remembers that you were all ready to obey . You welcomed him with respect and fear .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I am so happy that I can trust you fully .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	2	Corinthians 8:19 honor Or “ glory. ” See “ glory ” in the Word List .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	8	I am not ordering you to give , but I want to see how real your love is by comparing you with others who have been so ready and willing to help .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	3	I can tell you that they gave as much as they were able and even more than they could afford . No one told them to do this . It was their idea .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	4	But they asked us again and again—they begged us to let them share in this service for God ’ s people .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	5	And they gave in a way that we did not expect : They gave themselves to the Lord and to us before they gave their money . This is what God wants .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	6	So we asked Titus to help you finish this special work of giving . He is the one who started this work .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	7	You are rich in everything—in faith , in speaking ability , in knowledge , in the willingness to help , and in the love you learned from us . So now we want you to be rich in this work of giving too .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	9	You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ . You know that he gave up his heavenly riches for you . He gave up everything so that you could be richly blessed .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	10	This is what I think you should do : Last year you were the first to want to give , and you were the first who gave .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	11	So now finish the work you started . Then your “ doing ” will be equal to your “ wanting to do. ” Give from what you have .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	12	If you want to give , your gift will be accepted . Your gift will be judged by what you have , not by what you don ’ t have .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	13	We don ’ t want you to have troubles while others are comforted . We want everything to be equal .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	14	At this time you have plenty and can provide what they need . Then later , when they have plenty , they can provide what you need . Then everyone will have an equal share .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	15	As the Scriptures say , “ Those who gathered much did not have too much , and those who gathered little did not have too little. ” ( A ) Titus and His Companions
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	16	I thank God because he gave Titus the same love for you that I have .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	17	Titus agreed to do what we asked . In fact , he himself wanted very much to come see you .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	18	We are sending with Titus the brother who is praised by all the churches . He is praised because of his service to the Good News .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	19	Also , he was chosen by the churches to go with us when we carry this gift . We are doing this service to bring honor [ a ] to the Lord and to show that we really want to help .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	20	We are being careful so that no one will criticize us about the way we are caring for this large gift .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	21	We are trying to do what is right . We want to do what the Lord accepts as right and also what people think is right .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	22	Also , we are sending with them our brother who is always ready to help . He has proved this to us in many ways . And he wants to help even more now because he has much faith in you .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	23	Now about Titus—he is my partner . He is working together with me to help you . And about the other brothers—they are sent from the churches , and they bring honor to Christ .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	8	24	So show these men that you really have love . Show them why we are proud of you . Then all the churches can see it . Footnotes -
ERV	2%20Corinthians	9	2	I know that you want to help . I have been bragging about you to the people in Macedonia . I told them that you people in Achaia have been ready to give since last year . And your desire to give has made most of the people here ready to give also .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	9	9	As the Scriptures say , “ He gives generously to the poor ; his goodness will continue forever. ” ( A )
ERV	2%20Corinthians	9	3	But I am sending these brothers to you . I don ’ t want our bragging about you in this to be for nothing . I want you to be ready just as I said you would be .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	9	4	If any of those from Macedonia come with me , and they find that you are not ready , we will be ashamed . We will be ashamed that we were so sure of you . And you will be ashamed too !
ERV	2%20Corinthians	9	5	So I thought that I should ask these brothers to come there before we do . They will help in getting together the generous gift you promised . Then it will be ready when we come , and it will be seen as a blessing you are giving , not as something you were forced to do .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	9	6	Remember this : The one who plants few seeds will have a small harvest . But the one who plants a lot will have a big harvest .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	9	7	Each one of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give . You should not give if it makes you unhappy or if you feel forced to give . God loves those who are happy to give .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	9	8	And God can give you more blessings than you need , and you will always have plenty of everything . You will have enough to give to every good work .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	9	10	God is the one who gives seed to those who plant , and he gives bread for food . And God will give you spiritual seed and make that seed grow . He will produce a great harvest from your goodness .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	9	11	God will make you rich in every way so that you can always give freely . And your giving through us will make people give thanks to God .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	9	12	The service you are offering helps God ’ s people with their needs , but that is not all it does . It is also bringing more and more thanks to God .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	9	13	This service is a proof of your faith , and people will praise God because of it . They will praise God that you freely share what you have with them and with all people . They will praise him to see you following the Good News about Christ that you openly accepted . They will praise God because you freely share with them and with all people .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	9	14	And when they pray , they will wish they could be with you . They will feel this way because of the great grace that God gave you .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	9	15	Thanks be to God for his gift that is too wonderful to describe .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	10	2	Corinthians 10:17 Quote from Jer . 9:24 .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	10	10	Some people say , “ Paul ’ s letters are powerful and sound important , but when he is with us , he is weak and the worst speaker you have ever heard. ”
ERV	2%20Corinthians	10	3	We live in this world , but we don ’ t fight our battles in the same way the world does .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	10	4	The weapons we use are not human ones . Our weapons have power from God and can destroy the enemy ’ s strong places . We destroy people ’ s arguments ,
ERV	2%20Corinthians	10	5	and we tear down every proud idea that raises itself against the knowledge of God . We also capture every thought and make it give up and obey Christ .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	10	6	We are ready to punish anyone there who does not obey , but first we want you to be fully obedient .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	10	7	You must look at the facts before you . If you feel sure you belong to Christ , you must remember that we belong to Christ the same as you do .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	10	8	It may seem as though we boast too much about the authority the Lord gave us . But he gave us this authority to strengthen you , not to hurt you . So I will not be ashamed of whatever boasting we do .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	10	9	I don ’ t want you to think that I am trying to scare you with my letters .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	10	11	Those people should know this : When we are there with you , we will show the same power that we show now in our letters .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	10	12	We don ’ t dare put ourselves in the same class with those who think they are so important . We don ’ t compare ourselves to them . They use themselves to measure themselves , and they judge themselves by what they themselves are . This shows that they know nothing .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	10	13	But we will not boast about anything outside the work that was given us to do . We will limit our boasting to the work God gave us , but this work includes our work with you .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	10	14	We would be boasting too much only if we had not already come to you . But we have come to you with the Good News about Christ .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	10	15	We limit our boasting to the work that is ours . We don ’ t boast about the work other people have done . We hope that your faith will continue to grow . We hope that you will help our work to grow much larger .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	10	16	We want to tell the Good News in the areas beyond your city . We don ’ t want to boast about work that has already been done in someone else ’ s area .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	10	17	“ Whoever boasts should boast only about the Lord. ” [ a ]

ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	3	But I am afraid that your minds will be led away from your true and pure following of Christ . This could happen just as Eve was tricked by that snake with his clever lies .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	4	You seem to be quite patient with anyone who comes to you and tells you about a Jesus that is different from the Jesus we told you about . You seem very willing to accept a spirit or a message that is different from the Spirit and message that you received from us .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	5	I don ’ t think that those “ super apostles ” are any better than I am .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	6	It is true that I am not a trained speaker , but I do have knowledge . We have shown this to you clearly in every way .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	7	I did the work of telling God ’ s Good News to you without pay . I humbled myself to make you important . Do you think that was wrong ?
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I accepted pay from other churches . I took their money so that I could serve you .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	9	If I needed something when I was with you , I did not trouble any of you . The brothers who came from Macedonia gave me all that I needed . I did not allow myself to be a burden to you in any way . And I will never be a burden to you .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	10	No one there in Achaia will stop me from boasting about that . I say this with the truth of Christ in me .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	12	And I will continue doing what I am doing now , because I want to stop those people from having a reason to boast . They would like to say that the work they boast about is the same as ours .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	13	They are false apostles , lying workers . They only pretend to be apostles of Christ .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	14	That does not surprise us , because even Satan changes himself to look like an angel of light . [ b ]
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	15	So it does not surprise us if Satan ’ s servants make themselves look like servants who work for what is right . But in the end those people will get the punishment they deserve . Paul Tells About His Sufferings
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	16	I tell you again : No one should think that I am a fool . But if you think I am a fool , then accept me as you would accept a fool . Then I can boast a little too .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	17	But I am not talking the way the Lord would talk . I am boasting like a fool .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Others are boasting about their lives in the world . So I will boast too .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	19	You are wise , so you will gladly be patient with fools !
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	20	I say this because you are even patient with someone who forces you to do things and uses you . You are patient with those who trick you , or think they are better than you , or hit you in the face !
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	21	I am ashamed to say it , but we were too “ weak ” to do such things to you . But if anyone dares to boast , I will too . ( I am talking like a fool . )
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	22	Are those people Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Israelites [ c ] ? So am I . Are they from Abraham ’ s family ? So am I .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	23	Are they serving Christ ? I am serving him more . ( I am crazy to talk like this . ) I have worked much harder than they have . I have been in prison more often . I have been hurt more in beatings . I have been near death many times .

ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	26	In my constant traveling I have been in danger from rivers , from thieves , from my own people , and from people who are not Jews . I have been in danger in cities , in places where no one lives , and on the sea . And I have been in danger from people who pretend to be believers but are not .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	27	I have done hard and tiring work , and many times I did not sleep . I have been hungry and thirsty . Many times I have been without food . I have been cold and without clothes .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	28	And there are many other problems . One of these is the care I have for all the churches . I worry about each group of believers every day .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	29	I feel weak every time another person is weak . I feel deeply upset every time another person is led into sin .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	30	If I must boast , I will boast about the things that show I am weak .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	31	God knows that I am not lying . He is the God and Father of the Lord Jesus , and he is to be praised forever .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	11	32	When I was in Damascus , the governor under King Aretas wanted to arrest me , so he put guards around the city .

ERV	2%20Corinthians	12	14	I am now ready to visit you for the third time , and I will not be a burden to you . I don ’ t want any of the things you own . I only want you . Children should not have to save things to give to their parents . Parents should save to give to their children .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	12	5	I will boast about a man like that , but I will not boast about myself . I will boast only about my weaknesses .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	12	6	But if I wanted to say more about myself , I would not be a fool , because I would be telling the truth . But I won ’ t say any more , because I don ’ t want people to think more of me than what they see me do or hear me say .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	12	7	But I must not be too proud of the wonderful things that were shown to me . So a painful problem [ b ] was given to me—an angel from Satan , sent to make me suffer , so that I would not think that I am better than anyone else .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	12	8	I begged the Lord three times to take this problem away from me .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	12	9	But the Lord said , “ My grace is all you need . Only when you are weak can everything be done completely by my power. ” So I will gladly boast about my weaknesses . Then Christ ’ s power can stay in me .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	12	10	Yes , I am glad to have weaknesses if they are for Christ . I am glad to be insulted and have hard times . I am glad when I am persecuted and have problems , because it is when I am weak that I am really strong . Paul ’ s Love for the Believers in Corinth
ERV	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I have been talking like a fool , but you made me do it . You people are the ones who should say good things about me . I am worth nothing , but those “ super apostles ” are not worth any more than I am !
ERV	2%20Corinthians	12	13	So you received everything that the other churches have received . Only one thing was different : I was not a burden to you . Forgive me for this !
ERV	2%20Corinthians	12	15	So I am happy to give everything I have for you . I will even give myself for you . If I love you more , will you love me less ?
ERV	2%20Corinthians	12	16	It is clear that I was not a burden to you , but you think that I was tricky and used lies to catch you .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	12	17	Did I cheat you by using any of the men I sent to you ? You know I didn ’ t .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	12	18	I asked Titus to go to you , and I sent our brother with him . Titus did not cheat you , did he ? No , you know that his actions and his attitude were the same as ours .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	12	19	Do you think that we have been defending ourselves to you all this time ? No , we say these things in Christ and before God . You are our dear friends , and everything we do is to make you stronger .

I am afraid that I will find arguing , jealousy , anger , selfish fighting , evil talk , gossip , pride , and confusion there .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	12	21	I am afraid that when I come to you again , my God will make me humble before you . I may have to cry over the loss of some who sinned before .

ERV	2%20Corinthians	13	4	It is true that Christ was weak when he was killed on the cross , but he lives now by God ’ s power . It is also true that we share his weakness , but in dealing with you , we will be alive in him by God ’ s power .
ERV	2%20Corinthians	13	5	Look closely at yourselves . Test yourselves to see if you are living in the faith . Don ’ t you realize that Christ Jesus is in you ? Of course , if you fail the test , he is not in you .

ERV	2%20Corinthians	13	7	We pray to God that you will not do anything wrong . Our concern here is not for people to see that we have passed the test in our work with you . Our main concern is that you do what is right , even if it looks as if we have failed the test .

ERV	Galatians	1	1	Greetings from Paul , an apostle . I was chosen to be an apostle , but not by any group or person here on earth . My authority came from none other than Jesus Christ and God the Father , who raised Jesus from death .
ERV	Galatians	1	2	Greetings also from all those in God ’ s family who are with me . To the churches in Galatia [ a ] :
ERV	Galatians	1	3	I pray that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will be good to you and give you peace .
ERV	Galatians	1	4	Jesus gave himself for our sins to free us from this evil world we live in . This is what God our Father wanted .
ERV	Galatians	1	5	The glory belongs to God forever and ever . Amen . There Is Only One Good News Message
ERV	Galatians	1	6	A short time ago God chose you to follow him . He chose you through his grace that came through Christ . But now I am amazed that you are already turning away and believing something different from the Good News we told you .
ERV	Galatians	1	7	There is no other message that is the Good News , but some people are confusing you . They want to change the Good News about Christ .
ERV	Galatians	1	8	We told you the true Good News message . So anyone who tells you a different message should be condemned—even if it ’ s one of us or even an angel from heaven !
ERV	Galatians	1	9	I said this before . Now I say it again : You have already accepted the Good News . Anyone who tells you another way to be saved should be condemned !
ERV	Galatians	1	10	Now do you think I am trying to make people accept me ? No , God is the one I am trying to please . Am I trying to please people ? If I wanted to please people , I would not be a servant of Christ . Paul ’ s Authority Is From God
ERV	Galatians	1	11	,
ERV	Galatians	1	12	I did not get my message from any other human . The Good News is not something I learned from other people . Jesus Christ himself gave it to me . He showed me the Good News that I should tell people .

ERV	Galatians	1	14	.
ERV	Galatians	1	15	days .
ERV	Galatians	1	16	It pleased him to let me see and know his Son so that I could tell the Good News about him to the non-Jewish people . I immediately prepared to do this work without asking for advice or help from anyone .
ERV	Galatians	1	17	I did not go to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was . But , without waiting , I went away to Arabia . Later , I went back to the city of Damascus .
ERV	Galatians	1	18	Three years later I went to Jerusalem to meet Peter . [ b ] I stayed with him
ERV	Galatians	1	19	I met no other apostles—only James , the brother of the Lord .
ERV	Galatians	1	20	God knows there is nothing untrue in any of this .
ERV	Galatians	1	21	Later , I went to the areas of Syria and Cilicia .
ERV	Galatians	1	22	No one in any of Christ ’ s churches in Judea had ever met me before .
ERV	Galatians	1	23	They had only heard this about me : “ This man was persecuting us . But now he is telling people about the same faith that he once tried to destroy. ”
ERV	Galatians	1	24	These believers praised God because of me . Footnotes - Galatians 1:2 Galatia Probably the area where Paul began churches on his first missionary trip . Read Acts
ERV	Galatians	2	2	I went there because God showed me that I should go . I explained to them the message that I tell the non-Jewish people . I also met alone with those who were considered to be the leaders . I wanted to be sure we were in agreement so that my past work and the work I do now would not be wasted .
ERV	Galatians	2	14	They were not following the truth of the Good News . When I saw this , I spoke to Peter in front of everyone . I said , “ Peter , you are a Jew , but you don ’ t live like one . You live like someone who is not a Jew . So why are you trying to force those who are not Jewish to live like Jews ? ”
ERV	Galatians	2	3	Titus , who was with me , is a Greek . But these leaders still did not force him to be circumcised .
ERV	Galatians	2	4	We needed to talk about these problems , because some who pretended to be our brothers had come into our group secretly . They came in like spies to find out about the freedom we have in Christ Jesus . They wanted to make us slaves ,
ERV	Galatians	2	5	but we did not agree with anything those false brothers wanted . We wanted the truth of the Good News to continue for you .
ERV	Galatians	2	6	Those men who were considered to be important did not change the Good News message I tell people . ( It doesn ’ t matter to me if they were “ important ” or not . To God everyone is the same . )
ERV	Galatians	2	7	But these leaders saw that God had given me a special work , the same as Peter . God gave Peter the work of telling the Good News to the Jews . But God gave me the work of telling the Good News to the non-Jewish people .
ERV	Galatians	2	8	God gave Peter the power to work as an apostle for the Jewish people . God gave me the power to work as an apostle too , but for those who are not Jews .
ERV	Galatians	2	9	James , Peter , and John seemed to be the leaders . And they saw that God had given me this special gift of ministry , so they accepted Barnabas and me . They said to us , “ We agree that you should go to those who are not Jews , and we will go to the Jews. ”
ERV	Galatians	2	10	They asked us to do only one thing—to remember to help those who are poor . And this was something that I really wanted to do . Paul Shows That Peter Was Wrong
ERV	Galatians	2	11	When Peter came to Antioch , he did something that was not right . I stood against him , because he was wrong .
ERV	Galatians	2	12	This is what happened : When Peter first came to Antioch , he ate and associated with the non-Jewish people . But when some Jewish men came from James , Peter separated himself from the non-Jews . He stopped eating with them , because he was afraid of the Jews who believe that all non-Jewish people must be circumcised .
ERV	Galatians	2	13	So Peter was a hypocrite . The other Jewish believers joined with him , so they were hypocrites too . Even Barnabas was influenced by what these Jewish believers did .
ERV	Galatians	2	15	We are Jews by birth . We were not born “ sinners , ” as we call those who are not Jews .
ERV	Galatians	2	16	But we know that no one is made right with God by following the law . It is trusting in [ a ] Jesus Christ that makes a person right with God . So we have put our faith in Christ Jesus , because we wanted to be made right with God . And we are right with him because we trusted in [ b ] Christ—not because we followed the law . I can say this because no one can be made right with God by following the law .
ERV	Galatians	2	17	We Jews came to Christ to be made right with God , so it is clear that we were sinners too . Does this mean that Christ makes us sinners ? Of course not .
ERV	Galatians	2	18	But I would be wrong to begin teaching again those things that I gave up .
ERV	Galatians	2	19	It was the law itself that caused me to end my life under the law . I died to the law so that I could live for God . I have been nailed to the cross with Christ .
ERV	Galatians	2	20	So I am not the one living now—it is Christ living in me . I still live in my body , but I live by faith in [ c ] the Son of God . He is the one who loved me and gave himself to save me .
ERV	Galatians	2	21	I am not the one destroying the meaning of God ’ s grace . If following the law is how people are made right with God , then Christ did not have to die .

ERV	Galatians	3	3	You began your life in Christ with the Spirit . Now do you try to complete it by your own power ? That is foolish .
ERV	Galatians	3	2	Tell me this one thing : How did you receive the Spirit ? Did you receive the Spirit by following the law ? No , you received the Spirit because you heard the message about Jesus and believed it .
ERV	Galatians	3	4	You have experienced many things . Were all those experiences wasted ? I hope they were not wasted !
ERV	Galatians	3	5	Does God give you the Spirit because you follow the law ? Does God work miracles among you because you follow the law ? No , God gives you his Spirit and works miracles among you because you heard the message about Jesus and believed it .
ERV	Galatians	3	6	The Scriptures say the same thing about Abraham . “ Abraham believed God , and because of this faith he was accepted as one who is right with God. ” [ a ]
ERV	Galatians	3	7	So you should know that the true children of Abraham are those who have faith .
ERV	Galatians	3	8	The Scriptures told what would happen in the future . These writings said that God would make the non-Jewish people right through their faith . God told this Good News to Abraham before it happened . God said to Abraham , “ I will use you to bless all the people on earth. ” [ b ]
ERV	Galatians	3	9	Abraham believed this , and because he believed , he was blessed . All people who believe are blessed the same as Abraham was .
ERV	Galatians	3	10	But people who depend on following the law to make them right are under a curse . As the Scriptures say , “ They must do everything that is written in the law . If they do not always obey , they are under a curse. ” [ c ]
ERV	Galatians	3	11	So it is clear that no one can be made right with God by the law . The Scriptures say , “ The one who is right with God by faith will live forever. ” [ d ]
ERV	Galatians	3	12	The law does not depend on faith . No , it says that the only way a person will find life by the law is to obey its commands . [ e ]
ERV	Galatians	3	13	The law says we are under a curse for not always obeying it . But Christ took away that curse . He changed places with us and put himself under that curse . The Scriptures say , “ Anyone who is hung on a tree [ f ] is under a curse. ” [ g ]
ERV	Galatians	3	14	Because of what Jesus Christ did , the blessing God promised to Abraham was given to all people . Christ died so that by believing in him we could have the Spirit that God promised . The Law and the Promise
ERV	Galatians	3	15	Brothers and sisters , let me give you an example from everyday life : Think about an agreement that one person makes with another . After that agreement is made official , no one can stop it or add anything to it , and no one can ignore it .
ERV	Galatians	3	16	God made promises to Abraham and his Descendant . [ h ] The Scripture does not say , “ and to your descendants. ” That would mean many people . But it says , “ and to your Descendant. ” That means only one , and that one is Christ .
ERV	Galatians	3	17	This is what I mean : The agreement that God gave to Abraham was made official long before the law came . The law came
ERV	Galatians	3	430	years later . So the law could not take away the agreement and change God ’ s promise .
ERV	Galatians	3	18	Can following the law give us the blessing God promised ? If we could receive it by following the law , then it would not be God ’ s promise that brings it to us . But God freely gave his blessings to Abraham through the promise God made .
ERV	Galatians	3	19	So what was the law for ? The law was given to show the wrong things people do . The law would continue until the special Descendant of Abraham came . This is the Descendant mentioned in the promise , which came directly from God . But the law was given through angels , and the angels used Moses as a mediator to give the law to the people .
ERV	Galatians	3	20	But when God gave the promise , there was no mediator , because a mediator is not needed when there is only one side , and God is one . [ i ] The Purpose of the Law of Moses
ERV	Galatians	3	21	Does this mean that the law works against God ’ s promises ? Of course not . The law was never God ’ s way of giving new life to people . If it were , then we could be made right with God by following the law .
ERV	Galatians	3	22	But this is not possible . The Scriptures put the whole world in prison under the control of sin , so that the only way for people to get what God promised would be through faith in [ j ] Jesus Christ . It is given to those who believe in him .
ERV	Galatians	3	23	Before this faith came , the law held us as prisoners . We had no freedom until God showed us the way of faith that was coming .
ERV	Galatians	3	24	I mean the law was the guardian in charge of us until Christ came . After he came , we could be made right with God through faith .
ERV	Galatians	3	25	Now that the way of faith has come , we no longer need the law to be our guardian . 26-27 You were all baptized into Christ , and so you were all clothed with Christ . This shows that you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus .
ERV	Galatians	3	28	Now , in Christ , it doesn ’ t matter if you are a Jew or a Greek , a slave or free , male or female . You are all the same in Christ Jesus .
ERV	Galatians	3	29	You belong to Christ , so you are Abraham ’ s descendants . You get all of God ’ s blessings because of the promise that God made to Abraham .

ERV	Galatians	4	4	But when the right time came , God sent his Son , who was born from a woman and lived under the law .
ERV	Galatians	4	2	While they are children , they must obey those who are chosen to care for them . But when they reach the age the father set , they are free .
ERV	Galatians	4	3	It is the same for us . We were once like children , slaves to the useless rules [ a ] of this world .
ERV	Galatians	4	5	God did this so that he could buy the freedom of those who were under the law . God ’ s purpose was to make us his children .
ERV	Galatians	4	6	Since you are now God ’ s children , he has sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts . The Spirit cries out , “ Abba , [ b ] Father. ”
ERV	Galatians	4	7	Now you are not slaves like before . You are God ’ s children , and you will receive everything he promised his children . Paul ’ s Love for the Galatian Believers

ERV	Galatians	4	12	Brothers and sisters , I became like you . So please become like me . You were very good to me before .
ERV	Galatians	4	13	You know that I came to you the first time because I was sick . That was when I told the Good News to you .
ERV	Galatians	4	14	My sickness was a burden to you , but you did not stop showing me respect or make me leave . Instead , you welcomed me as if I were an angel from God . You accepted me as if I were Jesus Christ himself !
ERV	Galatians	4	15	You were very happy then . Where is that joy now ? I can say without a doubt that you would have done anything to help me . If it had been possible , you would have taken out your own eyes and given them to me .
ERV	Galatians	4	16	Am I now your enemy because I tell you the truth ?
ERV	Galatians	4	17	Those people [ c ] are working hard to persuade you , but this is not good for you . They want to persuade you to turn against us and work hard for them .
ERV	Galatians	4	18	It is good for you to work hard , of course , if it is for something good . That ’ s something you should do whether I am there or not .
ERV	Galatians	4	19	My little children , I am in pain again over you , like a mother giving birth . I will feel this pain until people can look at you and see Christ .
ERV	Galatians	4	20	I wish I could be with you now . Then maybe I could change the way I am talking to you . Now I don ’ t know what to do about you . The Example of Hagar and Sarah
ERV	Galatians	4	21	Some of you people want to be under the law . Tell me , do you know what the law says ?
ERV	Galatians	4	22	The Scriptures say that Abraham had two sons . The mother of one son was a slave woman , and the mother of the other son was a free woman .
ERV	Galatians	4	23	Abraham ’ s son from the slave woman was born in the normal human way . But the son from the free woman was born because of the promise God made to Abraham .
ERV	Galatians	4	24	This true story makes a picture for us . The two women are like the two agreements between God and his people . One agreement is the law that God made on Mount Sinai . The people who are under this agreement are like slaves . The mother named Hagar is like that agreement .
ERV	Galatians	4	25	So Hagar is like Mount Sinai in Arabia . She is a picture of the earthly Jewish city of Jerusalem . This city is a slave , and all its people are slaves to the law .
ERV	Galatians	4	26	But the heavenly Jerusalem that is above is like the free woman , who is our mother .
ERV	Galatians	4	27	The Scriptures say , “ Be happy , woman—you who can not have children . Be glad you never gave birth . Shout and cry with joy ! You never felt those labor pains . The woman who is alone [ d ] will have more children than the woman who has a husband. ” ( A )
ERV	Galatians	4	28	My brothers and sisters , you are children who were born because of God ’ s promise , just as Isaac was .
ERV	Galatians	4	29	But the other son of Abraham , who was born in the normal way , caused trouble for the one who was born by the power of the Spirit . It is the same today .
ERV	Galatians	4	30	But what do the Scriptures say ? “ Throw out the slave woman and her son ! The son of the free woman will receive everything his father has , but the son of the slave woman will receive nothing. ” [ e ]
ERV	Galatians	4	31	So , my brothers and sisters , we are not children of the slave woman . We are children of the free woman . Footnotes - Galatians 4:3 rules Or “ powers. ” Also in verse
ERV	Galatians	5	5	I say this because our hope of being right with God comes through faith . And the Spirit helps us feel sure as we wait for that hope .
ERV	Galatians	5	2	Listen ! I , Paul , tell you that if you start following the law by being circumcised , then Christ can not help you .
ERV	Galatians	5	3	Again , I warn everyone : If you allow yourselves to be circumcised , then you must follow the whole law .
ERV	Galatians	5	4	If you try to be made right with God through the law , your life with Christ is finished—you have left God ’ s grace .
ERV	Galatians	5	6	When someone belongs to Christ Jesus , it is not important if they are circumcised or not . The important thing is faith—the kind of faith that works through love .
ERV	Galatians	5	7	You were doing so well . Who caused you to stop following the truth ?
ERV	Galatians	5	8	It certainly wasn ’ t the one who chose you .
ERV	Galatians	5	9	Be careful ! “ Just a little yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise. ” [ a ]
ERV	Galatians	5	10	I trust in the Lord that you will not believe those different ideas . Someone is trying to confuse you . Whoever it is will be punished .
ERV	Galatians	5	11	My brothers and sisters , I don ’ t teach that a man must be circumcised . If I do teach circumcision , then why am I still being persecuted ? If I still taught circumcision , then my message about the cross would not be a problem .
ERV	Galatians	5	12	I wish those people who are bothering you would add castration [ b ] to their circumcision .
ERV	Galatians	5	13	My brothers and sisters , God chose you to be free . But don ’ t use your freedom as an excuse to do what pleases your sinful selves . Instead , serve each other with love .
ERV	Galatians	5	14	The whole law is made complete in this one command : “ Love your neighbor [ c ] the same as you love yourself. ” [ d ]
ERV	Galatians	5	15	If you continue hurting each other and tearing each other apart , be careful , or you will completely destroy each other . The Spirit and Human Nature
ERV	Galatians	5	16	So I tell you , live the way the Spirit leads you . Then you will not do the evil things your sinful self wants .
ERV	Galatians	5	17	The sinful self wants what is against the Spirit , and the Spirit wants what is against the sinful self . They are always fighting against each other , so that you don ’ t do what you really want to do .
ERV	Galatians	5	18	But if you let the Spirit lead you , you are not under law . [ e ]
ERV	Galatians	5	19	The wrong things the sinful self does are clear : committing sexual sin , being morally bad , doing all kinds of shameful things ,
ERV	Galatians	5	20	worshiping false gods , taking part in witchcraft , hating people , causing trouble , being jealous , angry or selfish , causing people to argue and divide into separate groups ,
ERV	Galatians	5	21	being filled with envy , getting drunk , having wild parties , and doing other things like this . I warn you now as I warned you before : The people who do these things will not have a part in God ’ s kingdom .
ERV	Galatians	5	22	But the fruit that the Spirit produces in a person ’ s life is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
ERV	Galatians	5	23	gentleness , and self-control . There is no law against these kinds of things .
ERV	Galatians	5	24	Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified their sinful self . They have given up their old selfish feelings and the evil things they wanted to do .
ERV	Galatians	5	25	We get our new life from the Spirit , so we should follow the Spirit .
ERV	Galatians	5	26	We must not feel proud and boast about ourselves . We must not cause trouble for each other or be jealous of each other .

ERV	Galatians	6	3	If you think you are too important to do this , you are only fooling yourself .
ERV	Galatians	6	4	Don ’ t compare yourself with others . Just look at your own work to see if you have done anything to be proud of .
ERV	Galatians	6	5	You must each accept the responsibilities that are yours . Never Stop Doing Good
ERV	Galatians	6	7	If you think you can fool God , you are only fooling yourselves . You will harvest what you plant .
ERV	Galatians	6	8	If you live to satisfy your sinful self , the harvest you will get from that will be eternal death . But if you live to please the Spirit , your harvest from the Spirit will be eternal life .
ERV	Galatians	6	9	We must not get tired of doing good . We will receive our harvest of eternal life at the right time . We must not give up .
ERV	Galatians	6	10	When we have the opportunity to do good to anyone , we should do it . But we should give special attention to those who are in the family of believers . Paul Ends His Letter
ERV	Galatians	6	11	This is my own handwriting . You can see how big the letters are .
ERV	Galatians	6	12	Those men who are trying to force you to be circumcised are only doing it so that their people will accept them . They are afraid they will be persecuted if they follow only the cross [ a ] of Christ .

ERV	Ephesians	1	7	In Christ we are made free by his blood sacrifice . We have forgiveness of sins because of God ’ s rich grace .
ERV	Ephesians	1	8	God gave us that grace fully and freely . With full wisdom and understanding
ERV	Ephesians	1	9	he let us know his secret plan . This was what God wanted , and he planned to do it through Christ .
ERV	Ephesians	1	10	God ’ s goal was to finish his plan when the right time came . He planned that all things in heaven and on earth be joined together with Christ as the head .
ERV	Ephesians	1	11	In Christ we were chosen to be God ’ s people . God had already planned for us to be his people , because that is what he wanted . And he is the one who makes everything agree with what he decides and wants .
ERV	Ephesians	1	12	We Jews were the first to hope in Christ . And we were chosen so that we would bring praise to God in all his glory .
ERV	Ephesians	1	13	It is the same with you . You heard the true message , the Good News about the way God saves you . When you heard that Good News , you believed in Christ . And in Christ , God put his special mark on you by giving you the Holy Spirit that he promised .
ERV	Ephesians	1	14	The Spirit is the first payment that guarantees we will get all that God has for us . Then we will enjoy complete freedom as people who belong to him . The goal for all of us is the praise of God in all his glory . Paul ’ s Prayer 15-16 That is why I always remember you in my prayers and thank God for you . I have done this ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all of God ’ s people .
ERV	Ephesians	1	17	I always pray to the great and glorious Father , the God of our Lord Jesus Christ . I pray that he will give you the Spirit , who will let you know truths about God and help you understand them , so that you will know him better .
ERV	Ephesians	1	18	I pray that God will open your minds to see his truth . Then you will know the hope that he has chosen us to have . You will know that the blessings God has promised his holy people are rich and glorious .
ERV	Ephesians	1	19	And you will know that God ’ s power is very great for us who believe . It is the same as the mighty power
ERV	Ephesians	1	20	he used to raise Christ from death and put him at his right side in the heavenly places .
ERV	Ephesians	1	21	He put Christ over all rulers , authorities , powers , and kings . He gave him authority over everything that has power in this world or in the next world .
ERV	Ephesians	1	22	God put everything under Christ ’ s power and made him head over everything for the church .
ERV	Ephesians	1	23	The church is Christ ’ s body . It is filled with him . He makes everything complete in every way . Footnotes - Ephesians 1:1 in Ephesus Some Greek copies do not have the words “ in Ephesus . ”
ERV	Ephesians	2	2	Yes , in the past your lives were full of those sins . You lived the way the world lives , following the ruler of the evil powers [ a ] that are above the earth . That same spirit is now working in those who refuse to obey God .
ERV	Ephesians	2	3	In the past all of us lived like that , trying to please our sinful selves . We did all the things our bodies and minds wanted . Like everyone else in the world , we deserved to suffer God ’ s anger just because of the way we were .
ERV	Ephesians	2	4	But God is rich in mercy , and he loved us very much .
ERV	Ephesians	2	5	We were spiritually dead because of all we had done against him . But he gave us new life together with Christ . ( You have been saved by God ’ s grace . )
ERV	Ephesians	2	6	Yes , it is because we are a part of Christ Jesus that God raised us from death and seated us together with him in the heavenly places .
ERV	Ephesians	2	7	God did this so that his kindness to us who belong to Christ Jesus would clearly show for all time to come the amazing richness of his grace .
ERV	Ephesians	2	8	I mean that you have been saved by grace because you believed . You did not save yourselves ; it was a gift from God .
ERV	Ephesians	2	9	You are not saved by the things you have done , so there is nothing to boast about .
ERV	Ephesians	2	10	God has made us what we are . In Christ Jesus , God made us new people so that we would spend our lives doing the good things he had already planned for us to do . One in Christ
ERV	Ephesians	2	11	You were not born as Jews . You are the people the Jews call “ uncircumcised . [ b ] ” Those Jews who call you “ uncircumcised ” call themselves “ circumcised. ” ( Their circumcision is only something they themselves do to their bodies . )
ERV	Ephesians	2	12	Remember that in the past you were without Christ . You were not citizens of Israel , and you did not know about the agreements [ c ] with the promises that God made to his people . You had no hope , and you did not know God .
ERV	Ephesians	2	13	Yes , at one time you were far away from God , but now in Christ Jesus , you are brought near to him . You are brought near to God through the blood sacrifice of Christ .
ERV	Ephesians	2	14	Christ is the reason we are now at peace . He made us Jews and you who are not Jews one people . We were separated by a wall of hate that stood between us , but Christ broke down that wall . By giving his own body ,
ERV	Ephesians	2	15	Christ ended the law with its many commands and rules . His purpose was to make the two groups become one in him . By doing this he would make peace .
ERV	Ephesians	2	16	Through the cross Christ ended the hate between the two groups . And after they became one body , he wanted to bring them both back to God . He did this with his death on the cross .
ERV	Ephesians	2	17	Christ came and brought the message of peace to you non-Jews who were far away from God . And he brought that message of peace to those who were near to God .
ERV	Ephesians	2	18	Yes , through Christ we all have the right to come to the Father in one Spirit .
ERV	Ephesians	2	19	So now you non-Jewish people are not visitors or strangers , but you are citizens together with God ’ s holy people . You belong to God ’ s family .
ERV	Ephesians	2	20	You believers are like a building that God owns . That building was built on the foundation that the apostles and prophets prepared . Christ Jesus himself is the most important stone [ d ] in that building .
ERV	Ephesians	2	21	The whole building is joined together in Christ , and he makes it grow and become a holy temple [ e ] in the Lord .
ERV	Ephesians	2	22	And in Christ you are being built together with his other people . You are being made into a place where God lives through the Spirit . Footnotes - Ephesians 2:2 ruler of the evil powers See “ Satan ” in the Word List . - Ephesians 2:11 uncircumcised People not having the mark of circumcision like the Jews have . - Ephesians 2:12 agreements The agreements with special promises that God gave at various times to people in the Old Testament . See “ agreement ” in the Word List . - Ephesians 2:20 most important stone Literally , “ cornerstone. ” The first and most important stone in a building . - Ephesians 2:21 temple God ’ s house—the place where God ’ s people worship him . Here , it means that believers are the spiritual temple where God lives .
ERV	Ephesians	3	3	God let me know his secret plan by showing it to me . I have already written a little about this .
ERV	Ephesians	3	2	Surely you know that God gave me this work through his grace to help you .
ERV	Ephesians	3	4	And if you read what I wrote , you can see that I understand the secret truth about Christ .
ERV	Ephesians	3	5	People who lived in other times were not told that secret truth . But now , through the Spirit , God has made it known to his holy apostles and prophets .
ERV	Ephesians	3	6	And this is the secret truth : that by hearing the Good News , those who are not Jews will share with the Jews in the blessings God has for his people . They are part of the same body , and they share in the promise God made through Christ Jesus .
ERV	Ephesians	3	7	By God ’ s special gift of grace , I became a servant to tell that Good News . He gave me that grace by using his power .
ERV	Ephesians	3	8	I am the least important of all God ’ s people . But he gave me this gift—to tell the non-Jewish people the Good News about the riches Christ has . These riches are too great to understand fully .
ERV	Ephesians	3	9	And God gave me the work of telling all people about the plan for his secret truth . That secret truth has been hidden in him since the beginning of time . He is the one who created everything .
ERV	Ephesians	3	10	His purpose was that all the rulers and powers in the heavenly places will now know the many different ways he shows his wisdom . They will know this because of the church .
ERV	Ephesians	3	11	This agrees with the plan God had since the beginning of time . He did what he planned , and he did it through Christ Jesus our Lord .
ERV	Ephesians	3	12	In Christ we come before God with freedom and without fear . We can do this because of our faith in Christ .
ERV	Ephesians	3	13	So I ask you not to be discouraged because of what is happening to me . My sufferings are for your benefit—for your honor and glory . The Love of Christ
ERV	Ephesians	3	14	So I bow in prayer before the Father .
ERV	Ephesians	3	15	Every family in heaven and on earth gets its true name from him .
ERV	Ephesians	3	16	I ask the Father with his great glory to give you the power to be strong in your spirits . He will give you that strength through his Spirit .
ERV	Ephesians	3	17	I pray that Christ will live in your hearts because of your faith . I pray that your life will be strong in love and be built on love .
ERV	Ephesians	3	18	And I pray that you and all God ’ s holy people will have the power to understand the greatness of Christ ’ s love—how wide , how long , how high , and how deep that love is .
ERV	Ephesians	3	19	Christ ’ s love is greater than anyone can ever know , but I pray that you will be able to know that love . Then you can be filled with everything God has for you .
ERV	Ephesians	3	20	With God ’ s power working in us , he can do much , much more than anything we can ask or think of .
ERV	Ephesians	3	21	To him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus for all time , forever and ever . Amen .
ERV	Ephesians	4	4	There is one body and one Spirit , and God chose you to have one hope .
ERV	Ephesians	4	2	Always be humble and gentle . Be patient and accept each other with love .
ERV	Ephesians	4	3	You are joined together with peace through the Spirit . Do all you can to continue as you are , letting peace hold you together .
ERV	Ephesians	4	5	There is one Lord , one faith , and one baptism .
ERV	Ephesians	4	6	There is one God and Father of us all , who rules over everyone . He works through all of us and in all of us .
ERV	Ephesians	4	7	Christ gave each one of us a special gift . Everyone received what he wanted to give them .
ERV	Ephesians	4	8	That is why the Scriptures say , “ He went up high into the sky ; he took prisoners with him , and he gave gifts to people. ” ( A )
ERV	Ephesians	4	9	When it says , “ He went up , ” what does it mean ? It means that he first came down low to earth .
ERV	Ephesians	4	10	So Christ came down , and he is the same one who went up . He went up above the highest heaven in order to fill everything with himself .
ERV	Ephesians	4	11	And that same Christ gave these gifts to people : He made some to be apostles , some to be prophets , some to go and tell the Good News , and some to care for and teach God ’ s people . [ a ]
ERV	Ephesians	4	12	Christ gave these gifts to prepare God ’ s holy people for the work of serving , to make the body of Christ stronger .
ERV	Ephesians	4	13	This work must continue until we are all joined together in what we believe and in what we know about the Son of God . Our goal is to become like a full-grown man—to look just like Christ and have all his perfection .
ERV	Ephesians	4	14	Then we will no longer be like babies . We will not be people who are always changing like a ship that the waves carry one way and then another . We will not be influenced by every new teaching we hear from people who are trying to deceive us—those who make clever plans and use every kind of trick to fool others into following the wrong way .
ERV	Ephesians	4	15	No , we will speak the truth with love . We will grow to be like Christ in every way . He is the head ,
ERV	Ephesians	4	16	and the whole body depends on him . All the parts of the body are joined and held together , with each part doing its own work . This causes the whole body to grow and to be stronger in love . The Way You Should Live
ERV	Ephesians	4	17	I have something from the Lord to tell you . I warn you : Don ’ t continue living like those who don ’ t believe . Their thoughts are worth nothing .
ERV	Ephesians	4	18	They have no understanding , and they know nothing because they refuse to listen . So they can not have the life that God gives .
ERV	Ephesians	4	19	They have lost their feeling of shame and use their lives to do what is morally wrong . More and more they want to do all kinds of evil .
ERV	Ephesians	4	20	But that way of life is nothing like what you learned when you came to know Christ .
ERV	Ephesians	4	21	I know that you heard about him , and in him you were taught the truth . Yes , the truth is in Jesus .
ERV	Ephesians	4	22	You were taught to leave your old self . This means that you must stop living the evil way you lived before . That old self gets worse and worse , because people are fooled by the evil they want to do .
ERV	Ephesians	4	23	You must be made new in your hearts and in your thinking .
ERV	Ephesians	4	24	Be that new person who was made to be like God , truly good and pleasing to him .
ERV	Ephesians	4	25	So you must stop telling lies . “ You must always speak the truth to each other , ” [ b ] because we all belong to each other in the same body .
ERV	Ephesians	4	26	“ When you are angry , don ’ t let that anger make you sin , ” [ c ] and don ’ t stay angry all day .
ERV	Ephesians	4	27	Don ’ t give the devil a way to defeat you .
ERV	Ephesians	4	28	Whoever has been stealing must stop it and start working . They must use their hands for doing something good . Then they will have something to share with those who are poor .
ERV	Ephesians	4	29	When you talk , don ’ t say anything bad . But say the good things that people need—whatever will help them grow stronger . Then what you say will be a blessing to those who hear you .
ERV	Ephesians	4	30	And don ’ t make the Holy Spirit sad . God gave you his Spirit as proof that you belong to him and that he will keep you safe until the day he makes you free .
ERV	Ephesians	4	31	Never be bitter , angry , or mad . Never shout angrily or say things to hurt others . Never do anything evil .
ERV	Ephesians	4	32	Be kind and loving to each other . Forgive each other the same as God forgave you through Christ . Footnotes - Ephesians 4:11 to care for … people Literally , “ to be shepherds and teachers. ” - Ephesians 4:25 Quote from Zech . 8:16 . - Ephesians 4:26 Quote from Ps . 4:4 ( Greek version ) .
ERV	Ephesians	5	5	You can be sure of this : No one will have a place in the kingdom of Christ and of God if that person commits sexual sins , or does evil things , or is a person who selfishly wants more and more . A greedy person like that is serving a false god .
ERV	Ephesians	5	2	Live a life of love . Love others just as Christ loved us . He gave himself for us—a sweet-smelling offering and sacrifice to God .
ERV	Ephesians	5	3	But there must be no sexual sin among you . There must not be any kind of evil or selfishly wanting more and more , because such things are not right for God ’ s holy people .
ERV	Ephesians	5	4	Also , there must be no evil talk among you . Don ’ t say things that are foolish or filthy . These are not for you . But you should be giving thanks to God .
ERV	Ephesians	5	6	Don ’ t let anyone fool you with words that are not true . God gets very angry when people who don ’ t obey him talk like that .
ERV	Ephesians	5	7	So don ’ t have anything to do with them .
ERV	Ephesians	5	8	In the past you were full of darkness , but now you are full of light in the Lord . So live like children who belong to the light .
ERV	Ephesians	5	9	This light produces every kind of goodness , right living , and truth .
ERV	Ephesians	5	10	Try to learn what pleases the Lord .
ERV	Ephesians	5	11	Have no part in the things that people in darkness do , which produce nothing good . Instead , tell everyone how wrong those things are .
ERV	Ephesians	5	12	Actually , it is shameful to even talk about the things those people do in secret .
ERV	Ephesians	5	13	But the light makes clear how wrong those things are .
ERV	Ephesians	5	14	Yes , everything is made clear by the light . This is why we say , “ Wake up , you who are sleeping ! Rise from death , and Christ will shine on you. ”
ERV	Ephesians	5	15	So be very careful how you live . Live wisely , not like fools .
ERV	Ephesians	5	16	I mean that you should use every opportunity you have for doing good , because these are evil times .
ERV	Ephesians	5	17	So don ’ t be foolish with your lives , but learn what the Lord wants you to do .
ERV	Ephesians	5	18	Don ’ t be drunk with wine , which will ruin your life , but be filled with the Spirit .
ERV	Ephesians	5	19	Encourage each other with psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs . Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord .
ERV	Ephesians	5	20	Always give thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ . Wives and Husbands
ERV	Ephesians	5	21	Be willing to serve each other out of respect for Christ .
ERV	Ephesians	5	22	Wives , be willing to serve your husbands the same as the Lord .
ERV	Ephesians	5	23	A husband is the head of his wife , just as Christ is the head of the church . Christ is the Savior of the church , which is his body .
ERV	Ephesians	5	24	The church serves under Christ , so it is the same with you wives . You should be willing to serve your husbands in everything .
ERV	Ephesians	5	25	Husbands , love your wives the same as Christ loved the church and gave his life for it .
ERV	Ephesians	5	26	He died to make the church holy . He used the telling of the Good News to make the church clean by washing it with water .
ERV	Ephesians	5	27	Christ died so that he could give the church to himself like a bride in all her beauty . He died so that the church could be holy and without fault , with no evil or sin or any other thing wrong in it .
ERV	Ephesians	5	28	And husbands should love their wives like that . They should love their wives as they love their own bodies . The man who loves his wife loves himself ,
ERV	Ephesians	5	29	because no one ever hates his own body , but feeds and takes care of it . And that is what Christ does for the church
ERV	Ephesians	5	30	because we are parts of his body .
ERV	Ephesians	5	31	The Scriptures say , “ That is why a man will leave his father and mother and join his wife , and the two people will become one. ” [ a ]
ERV	Ephesians	5	32	That secret truth is very important—I am talking about Christ and the church .
ERV	Ephesians	5	33	But each one of you must love his wife as he loves himself . And a wife must respect her husband . Footnotes - Ephesians 5:31 Quote from Gen. 2:24 .
ERV	Ephesians	6	6	You must do this not just to please your masters while they are watching , but all the time . Since you are really slaves of Christ , you must do with all your heart what God wants .
ERV	Ephesians	6	2	The command says , “ You must respect your father and mother. ” [ a ] This is the first command that has a promise with it .
ERV	Ephesians	6	3	And this is the promise : “ Then all will go well with you , and you will have a long life on the earth. ” [ b ]
ERV	Ephesians	6	4	Fathers , don ’ t make your children angry , but raise them with the kind of teaching and training you learn from the Lord . Slaves and Masters
ERV	Ephesians	6	5	Slaves , obey your masters here on earth with fear and respect . And do this with a heart that is true , just as you obey Christ .
ERV	Ephesians	6	7	Do your work , and be happy to do it . Work as though it is the Lord you are serving , not just an earthly master .
ERV	Ephesians	6	8	Remember that the Lord will give everyone a reward for doing good . Everyone , slave or free , will get a reward for the good things they do .
ERV	Ephesians	6	9	Masters , in the same way , be good to your slaves . Don ’ t say things to scare them . You know that the one who is your Master and their Master is in heaven , and he treats everyone the same . Wear the Full Armor of God
ERV	Ephesians	6	10	To end my letter I tell you , be strong in the Lord and in his great power .
ERV	Ephesians	6	11	Wear the full armor of God . Wear God ’ s armor so that you can fight against the devil ’ s clever tricks .
ERV	Ephesians	6	12	Our fight is not against people on earth . We are fighting against the rulers and authorities and the powers of this world ’ s darkness . We are fighting against the spiritual powers of evil in the heavenly places .
ERV	Ephesians	6	13	That is why you need to get God ’ s full armor . Then on the day of evil , you will be able to stand strong . And when you have finished the whole fight , you will still be standing .
ERV	Ephesians	6	14	So stand strong with the belt of truth tied around your waist , and on your chest wear the protection of right living .
ERV	Ephesians	6	15	On your feet wear the Good News of peace to help you stand strong .
ERV	Ephesians	6	16	And also use the shield of faith with which you can stop all the burning arrows that come from the Evil One .
ERV	Ephesians	6	17	Accept God ’ s salvation as your helmet . And take the sword of the Spirit—that sword is the teaching of God .
ERV	Ephesians	6	18	Pray in the Spirit at all times . Pray with all kinds of prayers , and ask for everything you need . To do this you must always be ready . Never give up . Always pray for all of God ’ s people .
ERV	Ephesians	6	19	Also pray for me—that when I speak , God will give me words so that I can tell the secret truth about the Good News without fear .
ERV	Ephesians	6	20	I have the work of speaking for that Good News , and that is what I am doing now , here in prison . Pray that when I tell people the Good News , I will speak without fear as I should . Final Greetings
ERV	Ephesians	6	21	I am sending you Tychicus , the brother we love . He is a faithful servant of the Lord ’ s work . He will tell you everything that is happening with me . Then you will know how I am and what I am doing .
ERV	Ephesians	6	22	That ’ s why I am sending him—to let you know how we are and to encourage you .
ERV	Ephesians	6	23	I pray that God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will give peace and love with faith to all the brothers and sisters there .
ERV	Ephesians	6	24	God ’ s grace to all of you who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love that never ends . Footnotes - Ephesians 6:2 Quote from Ex . 20:12 ; Deut . 5:16 . - Ephesians 6:3 Quote from Ex . 20:12 ; Deut . 5:16 .
ERV	Philippians	1	1	Greetings from Paul and Timothy , servants of Jesus Christ . To all of you in Philippi who are God ’ s holy people in Christ Jesus , including your elders [ a ] and special servants .
ERV	Philippians	1	2	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Paul ’ s Prayer
ERV	Philippians	1	3	I thank God every time I remember you .
ERV	Philippians	1	4	And I always pray for all of you with joy .
ERV	Philippians	1	5	I thank God for the help you gave me while I told people the Good News . You helped from the first day you believed until now .
ERV	Philippians	1	6	I am sure that the good work God began in you will continue until he completes it on the day when Jesus Christ comes again .
ERV	Philippians	1	7	I know I am right to think like this about all of you because you are so close to my heart . This is because you have all played such an important part in God ’ s grace to me—now , during this time that I am in prison , and whenever I am defending and proving the truth of the Good News .
ERV	Philippians	1	8	God knows that I want very much to see you . I love all of you with the love of Christ Jesus .
ERV	Philippians	1	9	This is my prayer for you : that your love will grow more and more ; that you will have knowledge and understanding with your love ;
ERV	Philippians	1	10	that you will see the difference between what is important and what is not and choose what is important ; that you will be pure and blameless for the coming of Christ ;
ERV	Philippians	1	11	that your life will be full of the many good works that are produced by Jesus Christ to bring glory and praise to God . Paul ’ s Troubles Help the Lord ’ s Work
ERV	Philippians	1	12	Brothers and sisters , I want you to know that all that has happened to me has helped to spread the Good News .
ERV	Philippians	1	13	All the Roman guards and all the others here know that I am in prison for serving Christ .
ERV	Philippians	1	14	My being in prison has caused most of the believers to put their trust in the Lord and to show more courage in telling people God ’ s message .
ERV	Philippians	1	15	Some people are telling the message about Christ because they are jealous and bitter . Others do it because they want to help .
ERV	Philippians	1	16	They are doing it out of love . They know that God gave me the work of defending the Good News .
ERV	Philippians	1	17	But those others tell about Christ because of their selfish ambition . Their reason for doing it is wrong . They only do it because they think it will make trouble for me in prison .
ERV	Philippians	1	18	But that doesn ’ t matter . What is important is that they are telling people about Christ , whether they are sincere or not . So I am glad they are doing it . I will continue to be glad ,
ERV	Philippians	1	19	because I know that your prayers and the help the Spirit of Jesus Christ gives me will cause this trouble to result in my freedom . [ b ]
ERV	Philippians	1	20	I am full of hope and feel sure I will not have any reason to be ashamed . I am certain I will continue to have the same boldness to speak freely that I always have . I will let God use my life to bring more honor to Christ . It doesn ’ t matter whether I live or die .
ERV	Philippians	1	21	To me , the only important thing about living is Christ . And even death would be for my benefit . [ c ]
ERV	Philippians	1	22	If I continue living here on earth , I will be able to work for the Lord . But what would I choose—to live or to die ? I don ’ t know .
ERV	Philippians	1	23	It would be a hard choice . Sometimes I want to leave this life and be with Christ . That would be much better for me ;
ERV	Philippians	1	24	however , you people need me here alive .
ERV	Philippians	1	25	I am sure of this , so I know that I will stay here and be with you to help you grow and have joy in your faith .
ERV	Philippians	1	26	When I am there with you again , you will be bursting with pride over what Christ Jesus did to help me .
ERV	Philippians	1	27	Just be sure you live as God ’ s people in a way that honors the Good News of Christ . Then if I come and visit you or if I am away from you , I will hear good things about you . I will know that you stand together with the same purpose and that you work together like a team to help others believe the Good News .
ERV	Philippians	1	28	And you will not be afraid of those who are against you . All of this is proof from God that you are being saved and that your enemies will be lost .
ERV	Philippians	1	29	God has blessed you in ways that serve Christ . He allowed you to believe in Christ . But that is not all . He has also given you the honor of suffering for Christ . Both of these bring glory to Christ .
ERV	Philippians	1	30	You saw the difficulties I had to face , and you hear that I am still having troubles . Now you must face them too . Footnotes - Philippians 1:1 elders Here , literally , “ overseers. ” See “ elders ( New Testament ) ” in the Word List . - Philippians 1:19 freedom Or “ salvation. ” - Philippians 1:21 death … benefit Paul says that death would be better , because death would bring him nearer to Christ .
ERV	Philippians	2	2	then do what will make my joy complete : Agree with each other , and show your love for each other . Be united in your goals and in the way you think .
ERV	Philippians	2	3	In whatever you do , don ’ t let selfishness or pride be your guide . Be humble , and honor others more than yourselves .
ERV	Philippians	2	4	Don ’ t be interested only in your own life , but care about the lives of others too . Learn From Christ to Be Unselfish
ERV	Philippians	2	5	In your life together , think the way Christ Jesus thought .
ERV	Philippians	2	6	He was like God in every way , but he did not think that his being equal with God was something to use for his own benefit .
ERV	Philippians	2	7	Instead , he gave up everything , even his place with God . He accepted the role of a servant , appearing in human form . During his life as a man ,
ERV	Philippians	2	8	he humbled himself by being fully obedient to God , even when that caused his death—death on a cross .
ERV	Philippians	2	9	So God raised him up to the most important place and gave him the name that is greater than any other name .
ERV	Philippians	2	10	God did this so that every person will bow down to honor the name of Jesus . Everyone in heaven , on earth , and under the earth will bow .
ERV	Philippians	2	11	They will all confess , “ Jesus Christ is Lord , ” and this will bring glory to God the Father . Be the People God Wants You to Be
ERV	Philippians	2	12	My dear friends , you always obeyed what you were taught . Just as you obeyed when I was with you , it is even more important for you to obey now that I am not there . So you must continue to live in a way that gives meaning to your salvation . Do this with fear and respect for God .
ERV	Philippians	2	13	Yes , it is God who is working in you . He helps you want to do what pleases him , and he gives you the power to do it .
ERV	Philippians	2	14	Do everything without complaining or arguing
ERV	Philippians	2	15	so that you will be blameless and pure , children of God without any fault . But you are living with evil people all around you , who have lost their sense of what is right . Among those people you shine like lights in a dark world ,
ERV	Philippians	2	16	and you offer them the teaching that gives life . So I can be proud of you when Christ comes again . You will show that my work was not wasted—that I ran in the race and won .
ERV	Philippians	2	17	Your faith makes you give your lives as a sacrifice in serving God . Maybe I will have to offer my own life with your sacrifice . But if that happens , I will be glad , and I will share my joy with all of you .
ERV	Philippians	2	18	You also should be glad and share your joy with me . News About Timothy and Epaphroditus
ERV	Philippians	2	19	With the blessing of the Lord Jesus , I hope I will be able to send Timothy to you soon . I will be glad to learn how you are .
ERV	Philippians	2	20	I have no one else like Timothy , who genuinely cares for you .
ERV	Philippians	2	21	Others are interested only in their own lives . They don ’ t care about the work of Christ Jesus .
ERV	Philippians	2	22	You know the kind of person Timothy is . He has served with me in telling the Good News like a son with his father .
ERV	Philippians	2	23	I plan to send him to you quickly , as soon as I know what will happen to me .
ERV	Philippians	2	24	I am sure the Lord will help me come to you soon .
ERV	Philippians	2	25	For now , I think I must send Epaphroditus back to you . He is my brother in God ’ s family , who works and serves with me in the Lord ’ s army . When I needed help , you sent him to me ,
ERV	Philippians	2	26	but now he wants very much to see all of you again . He is worried because you heard that he was sick .
ERV	Philippians	2	27	He was sick and near death . But God helped him and me too , so that I would not have even more grief .
ERV	Philippians	2	28	So I want very much to send him to you . When you see him , you can be happy . And I can stop worrying about you .
ERV	Philippians	2	29	Welcome him in the Lord with much joy . Give honor to people like Epaphroditus .
ERV	Philippians	2	30	He should be honored because he almost died for the work of Christ . He put his life in danger so that he could help me . This was help that you could not give me .
ERV	Philippians	3	3	But we are the ones who have the true circumcision [ b ] —we who worship God through his Spirit . We don ’ t trust in ourselves or anything we can do . We take pride only in Christ Jesus .
ERV	Philippians	3	2	Be careful of the dogs—those men whose work does only harm . They want to cut on everyone who isn ’ t circumcised . [ a ]
ERV	Philippians	3	4	Even if I am able to trust in myself , still I don ’ t do it . If anyone else thinks they have a reason to trust in themselves , they should know that I have a greater reason for doing so .
ERV	Philippians	3	5	I was circumcised on the eighth day after my birth . I am from the people of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin . I am a true Jew , and so were my parents . The law was very important to me . That is why I became a Pharisee .
ERV	Philippians	3	6	I was so eager to defend my religion [ c ] that I persecuted the church . And no one could find fault with the way I obeyed the Law of Moses .
ERV	Philippians	3	7	At one time all these things were important to me . But because of Christ , I decided that they are worth nothing .
ERV	Philippians	3	8	Not only these things , but now I think that all things are worth nothing compared with the greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord . Because of Christ , I lost all these things , and now I know that they are all worthless trash . All I want now is Christ .
ERV	Philippians	3	9	I want to belong to him . In Christ I am right with God , but my being right does not come from following the law . It comes from God through faith . God uses my faith in [ d ] Christ to make me right with him .
ERV	Philippians	3	10	All I want is to know Christ and the power that raised him from death . I want to share in his sufferings and be like him even in his death .
ERV	Philippians	3	11	Then there is hope that I myself will somehow be raised from death . Trying to Reach the Goal
ERV	Philippians	3	12	I don ’ t mean that I am exactly what God wants me to be . I have not yet reached that goal . But I continue trying to reach it and make it mine . That ’ s what Christ Jesus wants me to do . It is the reason he made me his .
ERV	Philippians	3	13	Brothers and sisters , I know that I still have a long way to go . But there is one thing I do : I forget what is in the past and try as hard as I can to reach the goal before me .
ERV	Philippians	3	14	I keep running hard toward the finish line to get the prize that is mine because God has called me through Christ Jesus to life up there in heaven .
ERV	Philippians	3	15	All of us who have grown to be spiritually mature should think this way too . And if there is any of this that you don ’ t agree with , God will make it clear to you .
ERV	Philippians	3	16	But we should continue following the truth we already have .
ERV	Philippians	3	17	Brothers and sisters , join together in following my example . Also , learn by watching those who are living the way we showed you .
ERV	Philippians	3	18	There are many who live like enemies of the cross of Christ . I have often told you about them . And it makes me cry to tell you about them now .
ERV	Philippians	3	19	The way they live is leading them to destruction . They have replaced God with their own desires . They do shameful things , and they are proud of what they do . They think only about earthly things .
ERV	Philippians	3	20	But the government that rules us is in heaven . We are waiting for our Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ , to come from there .
ERV	Philippians	3	21	He will change our humble bodies and make them like his own glorious body . Christ can do this by his power , with which he is able to rule everything . Footnotes - Philippians 3:2 want to cut on … circumcised There is a play on words here in Greek . The key word is like “ circumcision ” ( see “ circumcise , circumcision ” in the Word List ) , but it means “ mutilation ” or “ cutting to pieces. ” - Philippians 3:3 we are … circumcision Literally , “ we are the circumcision. ” See “ circumcise , circumcision ” in the Word List . - Philippians 3:6 eager to defend my religion Before Paul became a believer in Jesus as the Messiah , he thought it was his duty as a good Jew to oppose the Jews who had become Christ-followers . - Philippians 3:9 my faith in Or “ the faithfulness of . ”
ERV	Philippians	4	4	Always be filled with joy in the Lord . I will say it again . Be filled with joy .
ERV	Philippians	4	2	Euodia and Syntyche , you both belong to the Lord , so please agree with each other .
ERV	Philippians	4	3	For this I make a special request to my friend who has served with me so faithfully : Help these women . They worked hard with me in telling people the Good News , together with Clement and others who worked with me . Their names are written in the book of life . [ a ]
ERV	Philippians	4	5	Let everyone see that you are gentle and kind . The Lord is coming soon .
ERV	Philippians	4	6	Don ’ t worry about anything , but pray and ask God for everything you need , always giving thanks for what you have .
ERV	Philippians	4	7	And because you belong to Christ Jesus , God ’ s peace will stand guard over all your thoughts and feelings . His peace can do this far better than our human minds . [ b ]
ERV	Philippians	4	8	Brothers and sisters , continue to think about what is good and worthy of praise . Think about what is true and honorable and right and pure and beautiful and respected .
ERV	Philippians	4	9	And do what you learned and received from me—what I told you and what you saw me do . And the God who gives peace will be with you . Paul Thanks the Philippian Believers
ERV	Philippians	4	10	I am so happy , and I thank the Lord that you have again shown your care for me . You continued to care about me , but there was no way for you to show it .
ERV	Philippians	4	11	I am telling you this , but not because I need something . I have learned to be satisfied with what I have and with whatever happens .
ERV	Philippians	4	12	I know how to live when I am poor and when I have plenty . I have learned the secret of how to live through any kind of situation—when I have enough to eat or when I am hungry , when I have everything I need or when I have nothing .
ERV	Philippians	4	13	Christ is the one who gives me the strength I need to do whatever I must do .
ERV	Philippians	4	14	But it was good that you helped me when I needed help .
ERV	Philippians	4	15	You people in Philippi remember when I first told the Good News there . When I left Macedonia , you were the only church that gave me help .
ERV	Philippians	4	16	Several times you sent me things I needed when I was in Thessalonica .
ERV	Philippians	4	17	Really , it is not that I want to get gifts from you . But I want you to have the benefit that comes from giving .
ERV	Philippians	4	18	I have everything I need . I have even more than I need . I have all I need because Epaphroditus brought your gift to me . Your gift is like a sweet-smelling sacrifice offered to God . God accepts that sacrifice and it pleases him .
ERV	Philippians	4	19	My God will use his glorious riches to give you everything you need . He will do this through Christ Jesus .
ERV	Philippians	4	20	Glory to our God and Father forever and ever . Amen .
ERV	Philippians	4	21	Give our greetings to God ’ s people there—to each one who belongs to Christ Jesus . Those in God ’ s family who are with me send you their greetings .
ERV	Philippians	4	22	And greetings to you from all of God ’ s people here , especially those who work in the service of the emperor .
ERV	Philippians	4	23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Footnotes - Philippians 4:3 book of life God ’ s book that contains the names of his chosen people . See Rev . 3:5 ; 21:27 . - Philippians 4:7 can do … minds Literally , “ surpasses ( is better than ) every mind , ” which could also have the meaning “ is beyond all understanding . ”
ERV	Colossians	1	1	Greetings from Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus . I am an apostle because that is what God wanted . Greetings also from Timothy , our brother in Christ .
ERV	Colossians	1	2	To the holy and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ who live in Colossae . Grace and peace to you from God our Father .
ERV	Colossians	1	3	In our prayers we always thank God for you . He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
ERV	Colossians	1	4	We thank him because we have heard about the faith you have in Christ Jesus and the love you have for all of God ’ s people .
ERV	Colossians	1	5	Your faith and love continue because you know what is waiting for you in heaven—the hope you have had since you first heard the true message , the Good News
ERV	Colossians	1	6	that was told to you . Throughout the world , this Good News is bringing blessings and is spreading . And that ’ s what has been happening among you since the first time you heard it and understood the truth about God ’ s grace .
ERV	Colossians	1	7	You heard it from Epaphras , our dear friend and co-worker . He is a faithful servant of Christ for us . [ a ]
ERV	Colossians	1	8	He also told us about the love you have from the Spirit .
ERV	Colossians	1	9	Since the day we heard these things about you , we have continued praying for you . This is what we pray : that God will make you completely sure of what he wants by giving you all the wisdom and spiritual understanding you need ;
ERV	Colossians	1	10	that this will help you live in a way that brings honor to the Lord and pleases him in every way ; that your life will produce good works of every kind and that you will grow in your knowledge of God [ b ] ;
ERV	Colossians	1	11	that God will strengthen you with his own great power , so that you will be patient and not give up when troubles come . Then you will be happy
ERV	Colossians	1	12	and give thanks to the Father . He has made you able to have what he has promised to give all his holy people , who live in the light .
ERV	Colossians	1	13	God made us free from the power of darkness . And he brought us into the kingdom of his dear Son .
ERV	Colossians	1	14	The Son paid the price to make us free . In him we have forgiveness of our sins . The Son of God Is the Same as God
ERV	Colossians	1	15	No one can see God , but the Son is exactly like God . He rules over everything that has been made . [ c ]
ERV	Colossians	1	16	Through his power all things were made : things in heaven and on earth , seen and not seen— all spiritual rulers , lords , powers , and authorities . Everything was made through him and for him .
ERV	Colossians	1	17	The Son was there before anything was made . And all things continue because of him .
ERV	Colossians	1	18	He is the head of the body , which is the church . He is the beginning of everything else . And he is the first among all who will be raised from death . [ d ] So in everything he is most important .
ERV	Colossians	1	19	God was pleased for all of himself to live in the Son .
ERV	Colossians	1	20	And through him , God was happy to bring all things back to himself again— things on earth and things in heaven . God made peace by using the blood sacrifice of his Son on the cross .
ERV	Colossians	1	21	At one time you were separated from God . You were his enemies in your minds , because the evil you did was against him .
ERV	Colossians	1	22	But now he has made you his friends again . He did this by the death Christ suffered while he was in his body . He did it so that he could present you to himself as people who are holy , blameless , and without anything that would make you guilty before him .
ERV	Colossians	1	23	And that is what will happen if you continue to believe in the Good News you heard . You must remain strong and sure in your faith . You must not let anything cause you to give up the hope that became yours when you heard the Good News . That same Good News has been told to everyone on earth , and that ’ s the work that I , Paul , was given to do . Paul ’ s Work for the Church
ERV	Colossians	1	24	I am happy in my sufferings for you . There is much that Christ must still suffer . And I gladly accept my part of those sufferings in my body for the good of his body , the church .
ERV	Colossians	1	25	I became a servant of the church because God gave me a special work to do . This work helps you . My work is to tell the complete message of God .
ERV	Colossians	1	26	This message is the secret truth that was hidden since the beginning of time . It was hidden from everyone for ages , but now it has been made known to God ’ s holy people .
ERV	Colossians	1	27	God decided to let his people know just how rich and glorious that truth is . That secret truth , which is for all people , is that Christ lives in you , his people . He is our hope for glory .
ERV	Colossians	1	28	So we continue to tell people about Christ . We use all wisdom to counsel every person and teach every person . We are trying to bring everyone before God as people who have grown to be spiritually mature in Christ .
ERV	Colossians	1	29	To do this , I work and struggle using the great strength that Christ gives me . That strength is working in my life . Footnotes - Colossians 1:7 us Many ancient Greek copies have “ you. ” - Colossians 1:10 that your life … God Or “ that your knowledge of God will produce more and more good works of every kind in your life. ” - Colossians 1:15 He … made Literally , “ He is the firstborn of all creation. ” See “ firstborn ” in the Word List . - Colossians 1:18 first … death Literally , “ firstborn from the dead . ”
ERV	Colossians	2	2	I want them to be strengthened and joined together with love and to have the full confidence that comes from understanding . I want them to know completely the secret truth that God has made known . That truth is Christ himself .
ERV	Colossians	2	3	In him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are kept safe .
ERV	Colossians	2	4	I tell you this so that no one can fool you by telling you ideas that seem good , but are false .
ERV	Colossians	2	5	Even though I am far away , my thoughts are always with you . I am happy to see your good lives and your strong faith in Christ . Continue to Follow Christ Jesus
ERV	Colossians	2	6	You accepted Christ Jesus as Lord , so continue to live following him .
ERV	Colossians	2	7	You must depend on Christ only , drawing life and strength from him . Just as you were taught the truth , continue to grow stronger in your understanding of it . And never stop giving thanks to God .
ERV	Colossians	2	8	Be sure you are not led away by the teaching of those who have nothing worth saying and only plan to deceive you . That teaching is not from Christ . It is only human tradition and comes from the powers that influence [ a ] this world .
ERV	Colossians	2	9	I say this because all of God lives in Christ fully , even in his life on earth .
ERV	Colossians	2	10	And because you belong to Christ you are complete , having everything you need . Christ is ruler over every other power and authority .
ERV	Colossians	2	11	In Christ you had a different kind of circumcision , one that was not done by human hands . That is , you were made free from the power of your sinful self . That is the kind of circumcision Christ does .
ERV	Colossians	2	12	When you were baptized , you were buried with Christ , and you were raised up with him because of your faith in God ’ s power . God ’ s power was shown when he raised Christ from death .
ERV	Colossians	2	13	You were spiritually dead because of your sins and because you were not free from the power of your sinful self . But God gave you new life together with Christ . He forgave all our sins .
ERV	Colossians	2	14	Because we broke God ’ s laws , we owed a debt—a debt that listed all the rules we failed to follow . But God forgave us of that debt . He took it away and nailed it to the cross .
ERV	Colossians	2	15	He defeated the rulers and powers of the spiritual world . With the cross he won the victory over them and led them away , as defeated and powerless prisoners for the whole world to see . Don ’ t Follow Rules That People Make
ERV	Colossians	2	16	So don ’ t let anyone make rules for you about eating and drinking or about Jewish customs ( festivals , New Moon celebrations , or Sabbath days ) .
ERV	Colossians	2	17	In the past these things were like a shadow that showed what was coming . But the new things that were coming are found in Christ .
ERV	Colossians	2	18	Some people enjoy acting as if they are humble and love to worship angels . [ b ] They always talk about the visions they have seen . Don ’ t listen to them when they say you are wrong because you don ’ t do these things . It is so foolish for them to feel such pride , because it is all based on their own human ideas .
ERV	Colossians	2	19	They don ’ t keep themselves under the control of the head . Christ is the head , and the whole body depends on him . Because of Christ all the parts of the body care for each other and help each other . So the body is made stronger and held together as God causes it to grow .
ERV	Colossians	2	20	. - Colossians 2:18 worship angels Or “ worship with angels ” ( that they see in visions ) .
ERV	Colossians	2	21	“ Don ’ t eat this , ” “ Don ’ t taste that , ” “ Don ’ t touch that ” ?
ERV	Colossians	2	22	These rules are talking about earthly things that are gone after they are used . They are only human commands and teachings .
ERV	Colossians	2	23	These rules may seem to be wise as part of a made-up religion in which people pretend to be humble and punish their bodies . But they don ’ t help people stop doing the evil that the sinful self wants to do . Footnotes - Colossians 2:8 powers that influence Or “ elementary rules of. ” Also in verse
ERV	Colossians	3	3	Your old self has died , and your new life is kept with Christ in God .
ERV	Colossians	3	2	Think only about what is up there , not what is here on earth .
ERV	Colossians	3	4	Yes , Christ is now your life , and when he comes again , you will share in his glory .
ERV	Colossians	3	5	So put everything evil out of your life : sexual sin , doing anything immoral , letting sinful thoughts control you , and wanting things that are wrong . And don ’ t keep wanting more and more for yourself , which is the same as worshiping a false god .
ERV	Colossians	3	6	God will show his anger against those who don ’ t obey him , [ a ] because they do these evil things .
ERV	Colossians	3	7	You also did these things in the past , when you lived like them .
ERV	Colossians	3	8	But now put these things out of your life : anger , losing your temper , doing or saying things to hurt others , and saying shameful things .
ERV	Colossians	3	9	Don ’ t lie to each other . You have taken off those old clothes—the person you once were and the bad things you did then .
ERV	Colossians	3	10	Now you are wearing a new life , a life that is new every day . You are growing in your understanding of the one who made you . You are becoming more and more like him .
ERV	Colossians	3	11	In this new life it doesn ’ t matter if you are a Greek or a Jew , circumcised or not . It doesn ’ t matter if you speak a different language or even if you are a Scythian . [ b ] It doesn ’ t matter if you are a slave or free . Christ is all that matters , and he is in all of you . Your New Life With Each Other
ERV	Colossians	3	12	God has chosen you and made you his holy people . He loves you . So your new life should be like this : Show mercy to others . Be kind , humble , gentle , and patient .
ERV	Colossians	3	13	Don ’ t be angry with each other , but forgive each other . If you feel someone has wronged you , forgive them . Forgive others because the Lord forgave you .
ERV	Colossians	3	14	Together with these things , the most important part of your new life is to love each other . Love is what holds everything together in perfect unity .
ERV	Colossians	3	15	Let the peace that Christ gives control your thinking . It is for peace that you were chosen to be together in one body . [ c ] And always be thankful .
ERV	Colossians	3	16	Let the teaching of Christ live inside you richly . Use all wisdom to teach and counsel each other . Sing psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God .
ERV	Colossians	3	17	Everything you say and everything you do should be done for Jesus your Lord . And in all you do , give thanks to God the Father through Jesus . Your New Life at Home
ERV	Colossians	3	18	Wives , be willing to serve your husbands . This is the right thing to do in following the Lord .
ERV	Colossians	3	19	Husbands , love your wives , and be gentle to them .
ERV	Colossians	3	20	Children , obey your parents in everything . This pleases the Lord .
ERV	Colossians	3	21	Fathers , don ’ t upset your children . If you are too hard to please , they might want to stop trying .
ERV	Colossians	3	22	and

ERV	Colossians	3	24	Remember that you will receive your reward from the Lord , who will give you what he promised his people . Yes , you are serving Christ . He is your real Master . [ d ]
ERV	Colossians	3	25	Remember that anyone who does wrong will be punished for that wrong . And the Lord treats everyone the same .

ERV	Colossians	4	4	Pray that I will say what is necessary to make this truth clear to everyone .
ERV	Colossians	4	2	Never stop praying . Be ready for anything by praying and being thankful .

ERV	Colossians	4	5	Be wise in the way you act with those who are not believers . Use your time in the best way you can .

ERV	1%20Thessalonians	2	7	When we were with you , as apostles of Christ we could have used our authority to make you help us . But we were very gentle [ a ] with you . We were like a mother caring for her little children .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	2	8	We loved you very much , so we were happy to share God ’ s Good News with you . But not only that—we were also happy to share even our own lives with you .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	2	9	Brothers and sisters , I know that you remember how hard we worked . We worked night and day to support ourselves , so that we would not be a burden to anyone while we did the work of telling you God ’ s Good News .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	2	10	When we were there with you believers , we were pure , honest , and without fault in the way we lived . You know , just as God does , that this is true .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	2	11	You know that we treated each one of you the way a father treats his own children .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	2	12	We encouraged you , we comforted you , and we told you to live good lives for God . He calls you to be part of his glorious kingdom .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	2	13	Also , we always thank God because of the way you accepted his message . You heard it and accepted it as God ’ s message , not our own . And it really is God ’ s message . And it works in you who believe .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	Brothers and sisters , you are just like God ’ s churches in Judea . [ b ] I mean that you were treated badly by your own people , just as those believers in Christ Jesus were treated badly by other Jews—
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	2	15	the same Jews who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets . And they forced us to leave their country . They are not pleasing to God , and they are against everyone else .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	2	16	And they are trying to stop us from teaching those who are not Jews . They don ’ t want them to be saved . But they are just adding more and more sins to the ones they already have . Now the time has come for them to suffer God ’ s anger . Paul ’ s Desire to Visit Them Again
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	2	17	Brothers and sisters , we were separated from you for a short time . But even though we were not there , our thoughts were still with you . We wanted very much to see you , and we tried very hard to do this .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	2	18	Yes , we wanted to come to you . I , Paul , tried more than once to come , but Satan stopped us .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	2	19	You are our hope , our joy , and the crown we will be proud of when our Lord Jesus Christ comes .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	2	20	You bring us honor and joy . Footnotes -

ERV	1%20Thessalonians	3	4	Even when we were with you , we told you that we would all have to suffer . And you know that it happened just as we said .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	3	5	This is why I sent Timothy to you , so that I could know about your faith . I sent him when I could not wait anymore . I was afraid that the devil who tempts people might have defeated you with temptations . Then our hard work would have been wasted .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	3	6	But now Timothy has come back from his visit with you and told us good news about your faith and love . He told us that you always remember us in a good way . He told us that you want very much to see us again . And it is the same with us—we want very much to see you .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	3	7	So , brothers and sisters , we are encouraged about you because of your faith . We have much trouble and suffering , but still we are encouraged .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	3	8	Our life is really full if you stand strong in the Lord .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	3	9	We have so much joy before our God because of you ! So we thank God for you . But we can not thank him enough for all the joy we feel .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	3	10	Night and day we continue praying with all our heart that we can come there and see you again . We want to give you everything you need to make your faith strong .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	3	11	We pray that our God and Father and our Lord Jesus will prepare the way for us to come to you .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	3	12	We pray that the Lord will make your love grow . We pray that he will give you more and more love for each other and for all people . We pray that you will love everyone in the same way we love you .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	3	13	This will strengthen your desire to do what is right , and you will be holy and without fault before our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy people .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	4	1	Thessalonians 4:4 Or “ God wants each of you to learn to live with your wife in a way that is holy and that gives honor to God . ”

ERV	1%20Thessalonians	4	2	You know all that we told you to do by the authority of the Lord Jesus .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	4	3	God wants you to be holy . He wants you to stay away from sexual sins .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	4	5	Don ’ t let your sexual desires control you like the people who don ’ t know God .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	4	6	Never wrong any of your fellow believers or cheat them in this way . The Lord will punish those who do that . We have already told you this and warned you about it .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	4	7	God chose us to be holy . He does not want us to live in sin .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	4	8	So anyone who refuses to obey this teaching is refusing to obey God , not us . And God is the one who gives you his Holy Spirit .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	4	9	We don ’ t need to write to you about having love for your brothers and sisters in Christ . God has already taught you to love each other .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	4	10	In fact , you love all the believers in Macedonia . We encourage you now , brothers and sisters , to show your love more and more .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	4	11	Do all you can to live a peaceful life . Mind your own business , and earn your own living , as we told you before .

ERV	1%20Thessalonians	4	13	Brothers and sisters , we want you to know about those who have died . We don ’ t want you to be sad like other people—those who have no hope .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	4	14	We believe that Jesus died , but we also believe that he rose again . So we believe that God will raise to life through Jesus any who have died and bring them together with him when he comes .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	4	15	What we tell you now is the Lord ’ s own message . Those of us who are still living when the Lord comes again will join him , but not before those who have already died .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	4	16	The Lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud command , with the voice of the archangel , and with the trumpet call of God . And the people who have died and were in Christ will rise first .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	4	17	After that we who are still alive at that time will be gathered up with those who have died . We will be taken up in the clouds and meet the Lord in the air . And we will be with the Lord forever .

ERV	1%20Thessalonians	5	2	You know very well that the day when the Lord comes again will be a surprise , like a thief who comes at night .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	5	3	People will say , “ We have peace and we are safe. ” At that time destruction will come to them quickly , like the pains of a woman giving birth . And those people will not escape .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	5	4	But you , brothers and sisters , are not living in darkness . And so that day will not surprise you like a thief .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	5	6	So we should not be like other people . We should not be sleeping . We should be awake and have self-control .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	5	7	People who sleep , sleep at night . People who drink too much , drink at night .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	5	8	But we belong to the day , so we should control ourselves . We should wear faith and love to protect us . And the hope of salvation should be our helmet .
ERV	1%20Thessalonians	5	9	God did not choose us to suffer his anger . God chose us to have salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ .

ERV	2%20Thessalonians	1	4	So we tell the other churches of God how proud we are of you . We tell them how you patiently continue to be strong and have faith , even though you are being persecuted and are suffering many troubles . Paul Tells About God ’ s Judgment
ERV	2%20Thessalonians	1	5	This is proof that God is right in his judgment . He wants you to be worthy of his kingdom . Your suffering is for that kingdom .

ERV	2%20Thessalonians	1	7	And he will bring relief to you who are troubled . He will bring it to you and to us when the Lord Jesus comes from heaven for all to see , together with his powerful angels .
ERV	2%20Thessalonians	1	8	He will come with burning fire to punish those who don ’ t know God—those who refuse to accept the Good News about our Lord Jesus .
ERV	2%20Thessalonians	1	9	They will be punished with a destruction that never ends . They will not be allowed to be with the Lord but will be kept away from his great power .
ERV	2%20Thessalonians	1	10	This will happen on the day when the Lord Jesus comes to receive honor with his holy people . He will be admired among all who have believed . And this includes you because you believed what we told you .
ERV	2%20Thessalonians	1	11	That is why we always pray for you . We ask our God to help you live the good way he wanted when he chose you . The goodness you have makes you want to do good . And the faith you have makes you work . We pray that with his power God will help you do these things more and more .
ERV	2%20Thessalonians	1	12	Then the name of our Lord Jesus will be honored because of you , and you will be honored because of him . This can happen only by the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .

ERV	2%20Thessalonians	2	8	Then that Man of Evil will appear . But the Lord Jesus will kill him with the breath that comes from his mouth . The Lord will come in a way that everyone will see , and that will be the end of the Man of Evil .
ERV	2%20Thessalonians	2	9	When that Man of Evil comes , it will be the work of Satan . He will come with great power , and he will do all kinds of false miracles , signs , and wonders .
ERV	2%20Thessalonians	2	10	The Man of Evil will use every kind of evil to fool those who are lost . They are lost because they refused to love the truth and be saved .
ERV	2%20Thessalonians	2	11	So God will send them something powerful that leads them away from the truth and causes them to believe a lie .

God loved us and gave us through his grace a wonderful hope and comfort that has no end . Footnotes -

ERV	2%20Thessalonians	3	6	Brothers and sisters , by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ we tell you to stay away from any believer who refuses to work . People who refuse to work are not following the teaching that we gave them .
ERV	2%20Thessalonians	3	7	You yourselves know that you should live like we do . We were not lazy when we were with you .
ERV	2%20Thessalonians	3	8	We never accepted food from anyone without paying for it . We worked and worked so that we would not be a burden to any of you . We worked night and day .
ERV	2%20Thessalonians	3	9	We had the right to ask you to help us . But we worked to take care of ourselves so that we would be an example for you to follow .
ERV	2%20Thessalonians	3	10	When we were with you , we gave you this rule : “ Whoever will not work should not be allowed to eat. ”
ERV	2%20Thessalonians	3	11	We hear that some people in your group refuse to work . They are doing nothing except being busy in the lives of others .
ERV	2%20Thessalonians	3	12	Our instruction to them is to stop bothering others , to start working and earn their own food . It is by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ that we are urging them to do this .
ERV	2%20Thessalonians	3	13	Brothers and sisters , never get tired of doing good .
ERV	2%20Thessalonians	3	14	If there are some there who refuse to do what we tell you in this letter , remember who they are . Don ’ t associate with them . Then maybe they will feel ashamed .

ERV	1%20Timothy	1	2	To Timothy , a true son to me in the faith we share . Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord . Warnings Against False Teachings
ERV	1%20Timothy	1	3	When I went to Macedonia , I asked you to stay in Ephesus . Some people there are teaching things that are not true , and I want you to tell them to stop .
ERV	1%20Timothy	1	4	Tell them not to give their time to meaningless stories and to long lists of names to prove their family histories . Such things only cause arguments . They don ’ t help God ’ s work , which is done only by faith .
ERV	1%20Timothy	1	5	My purpose in telling you to do this is to promote love—the kind of love shown by those whose thoughts are pure , who do what they know is right , and whose faith in God is real .
ERV	1%20Timothy	1	6	But some have missed this key point in their teaching and have gone off in another direction . Now they talk about things that help no one .
ERV	1%20Timothy	1	7	They want to be teachers of the law , [ a ] but they don ’ t know what they are talking about . They don ’ t even understand the things they say they are sure of .
ERV	1%20Timothy	1	8	. -
ERV	1%20Timothy	1	9	We also know that the law is not made for those who do what is right . It is made for those who are against the law and refuse to follow it . The law is for sinners who are against God and all that is pleasing to him . It is for those who have no interest in spiritual things and for those who kill their fathers or mothers or anyone else .
ERV	1%20Timothy	1	10	It is for those who commit sexual sins , homosexuals , those who sell slaves , those who tell lies , those who don ’ t tell the truth under oath , and those who are against the true teaching of God .
ERV	1%20Timothy	1	11	That teaching is part of the Good News that our blessed God gave me to tell . In it we see his glory . Thanks for God ’ s Mercy
ERV	1%20Timothy	1	12	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord because he trusted me and gave me this work of serving him . He gives me strength .
ERV	1%20Timothy	1	13	In the past I insulted Christ . As a proud and violent man , I persecuted his people . But God gave me mercy because I did not know what I was doing . I did that before I became a believer .
ERV	1%20Timothy	1	14	But our Lord gave me a full measure of his grace . And with that grace came the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus .
ERV	1%20Timothy	1	15	Here is a true statement that should be accepted without question : Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners , and I am the worst of them .
ERV	1%20Timothy	1	16	But I was given mercy so that in me Christ Jesus could show that he has patience without limit . Christ showed his patience with me , the worst of all sinners . He wanted me to be an example for those who would believe in him and have eternal life .
ERV	1%20Timothy	1	17	Honor and glory to the King who rules forever . He can not be destroyed and can not be seen . Honor and glory forever and ever to the only God . Amen .
ERV	1%20Timothy	1	18	Timothy , you are like a son to me . What I am telling you to do agrees with the prophecies [ b ] that were told about you in the past . I want you to remember those prophecies and fight the good fight of faith .

ERV	1%20Timothy	1	20	. Also in verse
ERV	1%20Timothy	2	1	Timothy 2:14 Adam was not … tricked The devil tricked Eve , and Eve caused Adam to sin . See Gen. 3:1-13 .
ERV	1%20Timothy	2	2	You should pray for rulers and for all who have authority . Pray for these leaders so that we can live quiet and peaceful lives—lives full of devotion to God and respect for him .
ERV	1%20Timothy	2	3	This is good and pleases God our Savior .
ERV	1%20Timothy	2	4	God wants everyone to be saved and to fully understand the truth .
ERV	1%20Timothy	2	5	There is only one God , and there is only one way that people can reach God . That way is through Christ Jesus , who as a man
ERV	1%20Timothy	2	6	gave himself to pay for everyone to be free . This is the message that was given to us at just the right time .
ERV	1%20Timothy	2	7	And I was chosen as an apostle to tell people that message . ( I am telling the truth . I am not lying . ) I was chosen to teach those who are not Jews to believe and understand the truth . Special Instructions for Men and Women
ERV	1%20Timothy	2	8	I want the men everywhere to pray . Men who lift their hands in prayer must be devoted to God and pleasing to him . They must be men who keep themselves from getting angry and having arguments .
ERV	1%20Timothy	2	9	And I want the women to make themselves attractive in the right way . Their clothes should be sensible and appropriate . They should not draw attention to themselves with fancy hairstyles or gold jewelry or pearls or expensive clothes .
ERV	1%20Timothy	2	10	But they should make themselves attractive by the good things they do . That is more appropriate for women who say they are devoted to God .
ERV	1%20Timothy	2	11	A woman should learn while listening quietly and being completely willing to obey .
ERV	1%20Timothy	2	12	I don ’ t allow a woman to teach a man or tell him what to do . She must listen quietly ,
ERV	1%20Timothy	2	13	because Adam was made first . Eve was made later .
ERV	1%20Timothy	2	14	Also , Adam was not the one who was tricked . [ a ] It was the woman who was tricked and became a sinner .
ERV	1%20Timothy	2	15	But women will be saved in their work of having children . They will be saved if they continue to live in faith , love , and holiness with sensible behavior . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Timothy	3	1	Timothy 3:16 Christ Literally , “ who. ” Some Greek copies have “ God . ”
ERV	1%20Timothy	3	3	He must not drink too much , and he must not be someone who likes to fight . He must be gentle and peaceful . He must not be someone who loves money .
ERV	1%20Timothy	3	2	An elder [ b ] must be such a good man that no one can rightly criticize him . He must be faithful to his wife . [ c ] He must have self-control and be wise . He must be respected by others . He must be ready to help people by welcoming them into his home . He must be a good teacher .
ERV	1%20Timothy	3	4	He must be a good leader of his own family . This means that his children obey him with full respect .
ERV	1%20Timothy	3	5	If a man does not know how to lead his own family , he will not be able to take care of God ’ s church .
ERV	1%20Timothy	3	6	An elder must not be a new believer . It might make him too proud of himself . Then he would be condemned for his pride the same as the devil was .
ERV	1%20Timothy	3	7	An elder must also have the respect of people who are not part of the church . Then he will not be criticized by others and be caught in the devil ’ s trap . Special Servants
ERV	1%20Timothy	3	8	In the same way , the men who are chosen to be special servants must have the respect of others . They must not be men who say things they don ’ t mean or who spend their time drinking too much . They must not be men who will do almost anything for money .
ERV	1%20Timothy	3	9	They must follow the true faith that God has now made known to us and always do what they know is right .
ERV	1%20Timothy	3	10	You should test them first . Then , if you find that they have done nothing wrong , they can be special servants .
ERV	1%20Timothy	3	11	In the same way , the women [ d ] must have the respect of others . They must not be women who speak evil about other people . They must have self-control and be women who can be trusted in everything .
ERV	1%20Timothy	3	12	The men who are special servants must be faithful in marriage . [ e ] They must be good leaders of children and their own families .
ERV	1%20Timothy	3	13	Those who do well as special servants are making an honorable place for themselves . And they will feel very sure of their faith in Christ Jesus . The Secret of Our Life
ERV	1%20Timothy	3	14	I hope I can come to you soon . But I am writing this to you now ,
ERV	1%20Timothy	3	15	so that , even if I can not come soon , you will know how people should live in the family [ f ] of God . That family is the church of the living God . And God ’ s church is the support and foundation of the truth .
ERV	1%20Timothy	3	16	Without a doubt , the secret of our life of worship is great : Christ [ g ] was shown to us in human form ; the Spirit proved that he was right ; he was seen by angels . The message about him was told to the nations ; people in the world believed in him ; he was taken up to heaven in glory . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Timothy	4	1	Timothy 4:14 prophecy Something said about Timothy ’ s life before that thing happened .
ERV	1%20Timothy	4	4	Everything that God made is good . Nothing he made should be refused if it is accepted with thanks to him .
ERV	1%20Timothy	4	2	Those teachings come through people who tell lies and trick others . These evil people can not see what is right and what is wrong . It is like their conscience has been destroyed with a hot iron .
ERV	1%20Timothy	4	3	They say that it is wrong to marry . And they say that there are some foods that people must not eat . But God made these foods , and those who believe and who understand the truth can eat them with thanks .
ERV	1%20Timothy	4	5	Everything he created is made holy by what he has said and by prayer . Be a Good Servant of Christ Jesus
ERV	1%20Timothy	4	6	Tell this to the brothers and sisters there . This will show that you are a good servant of Christ Jesus . You will show that you are made strong by the words of faith and good teaching you have followed .
ERV	1%20Timothy	4	7	People tell silly stories that don ’ t agree with God ’ s truth . Don ’ t follow what these stories teach . But teach yourself to be devoted to God .
ERV	1%20Timothy	4	8	Training your body helps you in some ways . But devotion to God helps you in every way . It brings you blessings in this life and in the future life too .
ERV	1%20Timothy	4	9	Here is a true statement that should be accepted without question :
ERV	1%20Timothy	4	10	We hope in the living God , the Savior of all people . In particular , he is the Savior of all those who believe in him . This is why we work and struggle .
ERV	1%20Timothy	4	11	Command and teach these things .
ERV	1%20Timothy	4	12	You are young , but don ’ t let anyone treat you as if you are not important . Be an example to show the believers how they should live . Show them by what you say , by the way you live , by your love , by your faith , and by your pure life .
ERV	1%20Timothy	4	13	Continue to read the Scriptures to the people , encourage them , and teach them . Do this until I come .
ERV	1%20Timothy	4	14	Remember to use the gift you have , which was given to you through a prophecy [ a ] when the group of elders laid their hands on you .
ERV	1%20Timothy	4	15	Continue to do these things . Give your life to doing them . Then everyone can see that your work is progressing .
ERV	1%20Timothy	4	16	Be careful in your life and in your teaching . Continue to live and teach rightly . Then you will save yourself and those who listen to your teaching . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	1	Timothy 5:18 Quote from Lk . 10:7 .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	5	A widow who really needs help is one who has been left all alone . She trusts God to take care of her . She prays all the time , night and day , and asks God for help .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	2	Treat the older women like mothers . And treat the younger women with respect like sisters . Taking Care of Widows
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	3	Take care of widows who really need help .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	4	But if a widow has children or grandchildren , the first thing they need to learn is this : to show their devotion to God by taking care of their own family . They will be repaying their parents , and this pleases God .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	6	But the widow who uses her life to please herself is really dead while she is still living .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	7	Tell the believers there to take care of their family so that no one can say they are doing wrong .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	8	Everyone should take care of all their own people . Most important , they should take care of their own family . If they do not do that , then they do not accept what we believe . They are worse than someone who does not even believe in God .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	9	To be added to your list of widows , a woman must be
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	60	years old or older . She must have been faithful to her husband . [ a ]
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	10	She must be known for the good she has done : raising children , welcoming travelers into her home , serving the needs [ b ] of God ’ s people , helping those in trouble , and using her life to do all kinds of good .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	11	But don ’ t put younger widows on that list . When their strong physical needs pull them away from their commitment to Christ , they will want to marry again .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	12	Then they will be guilty of not doing what they first promised to do .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	13	Also , these younger widows begin to waste their time going from house to house . They also begin to gossip and try to run other people ’ s lives . They say things they should not say .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	14	So I want the younger widows to marry , have children , and take care of their homes . If they do this , our enemy will not have any reason to criticize them .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	15	But some of the younger widows have already turned away to follow Satan .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	16	If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family , she [ c ] should take care of them herself . Then the church will not have that burden and will be able to care for the widows who have no one else to help them . More About Elders and Other Matters
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	17	The elders who lead the church in a good way should receive double honor [ d ] —in particular , those who do the work of counseling and teaching .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	18	As the Scriptures say , “ When a work animal is being used to separate grain , don ’ t keep it from eating the grain. ” [ e ] And the Scriptures also say , “ A worker should be given his pay. ” [ f ]
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	19	Don ’ t listen to someone who accuses an elder . You should listen to them only if there are two or three others who can say what the elder did wrong .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	20	Tell those who sin that they are wrong . Do this in front of the whole church so that the others will have a warning .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	21	Before God and Jesus Christ and the chosen angels , I tell you to make these judgments without any prejudice . Treat every person the same .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	22	Think carefully before you lay your hands on anyone to make him an elder . Don ’ t share in the sins of others . Keep yourself pure .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	23	Timothy , stop drinking only water , and drink a little wine . This will help your stomach , and you will not be sick so often .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	24	The sins of some people are easy to see . Their sins show that they will be judged . But the sins of some others are seen only later .
ERV	1%20Timothy	5	25	It is the same with the good things people do . Some are easy to see . But even if they are not obvious now , none of them will stay hidden forever . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	1	Timothy
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	6	Devotion to God is , in fact , a way for people to be very rich , but only if it makes them satisfied with what they have .
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	2	Some slaves have masters who are believers , so they are brothers . Does this mean they should show their masters any less respect ? No , they should serve them even better , because they are helping believers , people they should love . This is what you must teach and tell everyone to do . False Teaching and True Riches
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	3	Some people will teach what is false and will not agree with the true teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ . They will not accept the teaching that produces a life of devotion to God .
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	4	They are proud of what they know , but they understand nothing . They are sick with a love for arguing and fighting about words . And that brings jealousy , quarrels , insults , and evil mistrust .
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	5	They are always making trouble , because they are people whose thinking has been confused . They have lost their understanding of the truth . They think that devotion to God is a way to get rich .
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	7	When we came into the world , we brought nothing . And when we die , we can take nothing out .
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	8	So , if we have food and clothes , we will be satisfied with that .
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	9	People who want to be rich bring temptations to themselves . They are caught in a trap . They begin to want many foolish things that will hurt them . These things ruin and destroy people .
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	10	The love of money causes all kinds of evil . Some people have turned away from what we believe because they want to get more and more money . But they have caused themselves a lot of pain and sorrow . Some Things to Remember
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	11	But you belong to God . So you should stay away from all those things . Always try to do what is right , to be devoted to God , and to have faith , love , patience , and gentleness .
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	12	We have to fight to keep our faith . Try as hard as you can to win that fight . Take hold of eternal life . It is the life you were chosen to have when you confessed your faith in Jesus—that wonderful truth that you spoke so openly and that so many people heard .
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	13	Before God and Christ Jesus I give you a command . Jesus is the one who confessed that same wonderful truth when he stood before Pontius Pilate . And God is the one who gives life to everything . Now I tell you this :
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	14	Do what you were commanded to do without fault or blame until the time when our Lord Jesus Christ comes again .
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	15	God will make that happen at the right time . God is the blessed and only Ruler . He is the King of all kings and the Lord of all lords .
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	16	God is the only one who never dies . He lives in light so bright that people can not go near it . No one has ever seen him ; no one is able to see him . All honor and power belong to him forever . Amen .
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	17	Give this command to those who are rich with the things of this world . Tell them not to be proud . Tell them to hope in God , not their money . Money can not be trusted , but God takes care of us richly . He gives us everything to enjoy .
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	18	Tell those who are rich to do good—to be rich in good works . And tell them they should be happy to give and ready to share .
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	19	By doing this , they will be saving up a treasure for themselves . And that treasure will be a strong foundation on which their future life will be built . They will be able to have the life that is true life .
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	20	Timothy , God has trusted you with many things . Keep these things safe . Stay away from people who talk about useless things that are not from God and who argue against you with a “ knowledge ” that is not knowledge at all .
ERV	1%20Timothy	6	21	Some people who claim to have that “ knowledge ” have gone completely away from what we believe . God ’ s grace be with you all .
ERV	2%20Timothy	1	2	Timothy 1:12 what … care Or “ what he has trusted me with . ”
ERV	2%20Timothy	1	1	Greetings from Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus . I am an apostle because God wanted me to be . God sent me to tell people about the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus .
ERV	2%20Timothy	1	3	I always remember you in my prayers day and night . And in these prayers I thank God for you . He is the God my ancestors served , and I have always served him with a clear conscience .
ERV	2%20Timothy	1	4	I remember that you cried for me . I want very much to see you so that I can be filled with joy .
ERV	2%20Timothy	1	5	I remember your true faith . That kind of faith first belonged to your grandmother Lois and to your mother Eunice . I know you now have that same faith .
ERV	2%20Timothy	1	6	That is why I want you to remember the gift God gave you . God gave you that gift when I laid my hands on you . Now I want you to use that gift and let it grow more and more , like a small flame grows into a fire .
ERV	2%20Timothy	1	7	The Spirit God gave us does not make us afraid . His Spirit is a source of power and love and self-control .
ERV	2%20Timothy	1	8	So don ’ t be ashamed to tell people about our Lord Jesus . And don ’ t be ashamed of me—I am in prison for the Lord . But suffer with me for the Good News . God gives us the strength to do that .
ERV	2%20Timothy	1	9	God saved us and chose us to be his holy people , but not because of anything we ourselves did . God saved us and made us his people because that was what he wanted and because of his grace . That grace was given to us through Christ Jesus before time began .
ERV	2%20Timothy	1	10	And now it has been shown to us in the coming of our Savior Christ Jesus . He destroyed death and showed us the way to have life . Yes , through the Good News Jesus showed us the way to have life that can not be destroyed .
ERV	2%20Timothy	1	11	I was chosen to tell people that message as an apostle and teacher .
ERV	2%20Timothy	1	12	And I suffer now because of that work . But I am not ashamed , because I know the one I have put my trust in . And I am sure that he is able to protect what I have put into his care [ a ] until that Day .
ERV	2%20Timothy	1	13	What you heard me teach is an example of what you should teach . Follow that model of right teaching with the faith and love we have in Christ Jesus .
ERV	2%20Timothy	1	14	This teaching is a treasure that you have been trusted with . Protect it with the help of the Holy Spirit , who lives inside us .
ERV	2%20Timothy	1	15	You know that everyone in Asia has left me . Even Phygelus and Hermogenes have left me .
ERV	2%20Timothy	1	16	I pray that the Lord will show mercy to the family of Onesiphorus . Many times Onesiphorus encouraged me . He was not ashamed that I was in prison .
ERV	2%20Timothy	1	17	No , he was not ashamed . When he came to Rome , he looked and looked for me until he found me .
ERV	2%20Timothy	1	18	I pray that the Lord Jesus will make sure Onesiphorus receives mercy from the Lord God on that Day . You know how many ways this brother helped me in Ephesus . Footnotes -

ERV	2%20Timothy	2	9	And because I tell that message , I am suffering . I am even bound with chains like someone who has really done wrong . But God ’ s message is not bound .
ERV	2%20Timothy	2	10	So I patiently accept all these troubles . I do this to help the people God has chosen so that they can have the salvation that is in Christ Jesus . With this salvation comes glory that never ends .
ERV	2%20Timothy	2	11	Here is a true statement : If we died with him , we will also live with him .
ERV	2%20Timothy	2	12	If we remain faithful even in suffering , we will also rule with him . If we refuse to say we know him , he will refuse to say he knows us .
ERV	2%20Timothy	2	13	If we are not faithful , he will still be faithful , because he can not be false to himself . A Worker Who Pleases God
ERV	2%20Timothy	2	14	Keep on telling everyone these truths . And warn them before God not to argue about words . Such arguments don ’ t help anyone , and they ruin those who listen to them .
ERV	2%20Timothy	2	15	Do your best to be the kind of person God will accept , and give yourself to him . Be a worker who has no reason to be ashamed of his work , one who applies the true teaching in the right way .
ERV	2%20Timothy	2	16	Stay away from people who talk about useless things that are not from God . That kind of talk will lead a person more and more against God .
ERV	2%20Timothy	2	17	Their evil teaching will spread like a sickness inside the body . Hymenaeus and Philetus are men like that .
ERV	2%20Timothy	2	18	They have left the true teaching . They say that the day when people will be raised from death has already come and gone . And they are destroying the faith of some people .
ERV	2%20Timothy	2	19	But God ’ s strong foundation never moves , and these words are written on it : “ The Lord knows those who belong to him. ” [ a ] Also , these words are written there : “ Everyone who says they believe in the Lord must stop doing wrong. ”
ERV	2%20Timothy	2	20	In a large house there are things made of gold and silver . But there are also things made of wood and clay . Some of these are used for special purposes , others for ordinary jobs .
ERV	2%20Timothy	2	21	The Lord wants to use you for special purposes , so make yourself clean from all evil . Then you will be holy , and the Master can use you . You will be ready for any good work .
ERV	2%20Timothy	2	22	Stay away from the evil things a young person like you typically wants to do . Do your best to live right and to have faith , love , and peace , together with others who trust in the Lord with pure hearts .
ERV	2%20Timothy	2	23	Stay away from foolish and stupid arguments . You know that these arguments grow into bigger arguments .
ERV	2%20Timothy	2	24	As a servant of the Lord , you must not argue . You must be kind to everyone . You must be a good teacher , and you must be patient .
ERV	2%20Timothy	2	25	You must gently teach those who don ’ t agree with you . Maybe God will let them change their hearts so that they can accept the truth .
ERV	2%20Timothy	2	26	The devil has trapped them and now makes them do what he wants . But maybe they can wake up to see what is happening and free themselves from the devil ’ s trap . Footnotes -

ERV	Titus	1	1	Tim . 3:4 . - Titus 1:7 elder Here , literally , “ overseer. ” See “ elders ( New Testament ) ” in the Word List .
ERV	Titus	1	2	This faith and knowledge make us sure that we have eternal life . God promised that life to us before time began—and God does not lie .
ERV	Titus	1	3	At the right time , God let the world know about that life . He did this through the telling of the Good News message , and he trusted me with that work . I told people that message because God our Savior commanded me to .
ERV	Titus	1	4	To Titus , a true son to me in the faith we share together . Grace and peace to you from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior . Titus ’ Work in Crete
ERV	Titus	1	5	I left you in Crete so that you could finish doing what still needed to be done . And I also left you there so that you could choose men to be elders in every town .
ERV	Titus	1	6	To be an elder , a man must not be guilty of living in a wrong way . He must be faithful to his wife , [ a ] and his children must be faithful to God . [ b ] They must not be known as children who are wild or don ’ t obey .
ERV	Titus	1	7	An elder [ c ] has the job of taking care of God ’ s work . So people should not be able to say that he lives in a wrong way . He must not be someone who is proud and selfish or who gets angry quickly . He must not drink too much , and he must not be someone who likes to fight . He must not be a man who will do almost anything for money .
ERV	Titus	1	8	An elder must be ready to help people by welcoming them into his home . He must love what is good . He must be wise . He must live right . He must be devoted to God and pleasing to him . And he must be able to control himself .
ERV	Titus	1	9	An elder must be faithful to the same true message we teach . Then he will be able to encourage others with teaching that is true and right . And he will be able to show those who are against this teaching that they are wrong .
ERV	Titus	1	10	This is important , because there are many people who refuse to obey—people who talk about worthless things and mislead others . I am talking especially about those who say that men who are not Jews must be circumcised to please God .
ERV	Titus	1	11	These people must be stopped , because they are destroying whole families by teaching what they should not teach . They teach only to cheat people and make money .
ERV	Titus	1	12	Even one of their own prophets said , “ Cretans are always liars . They are evil animals and lazy people who do nothing but eat. ”
ERV	Titus	1	13	The words that prophet said are true . So tell those people that they are wrong . You must be strict with them . Then they will become strong in the faith ,
ERV	Titus	1	14	and they will stop paying attention to the stories told by those Jews . They will stop following the commands of those who have turned away from the truth .
ERV	Titus	1	15	To people who are pure , everything is pure . But to those who are full of sin and don ’ t believe , nothing is pure . Really , their thinking has become evil and their consciences have been ruined .
ERV	Titus	1	16	They say they know God , but the evil things they do show that they don ’ t accept him . They are disgusting . They refuse to obey God and are not capable of doing anything good .

Compare this verse with
ERV	Titus	2	2	Teach the older men to have self-control , to be serious , and to be wise . They must be strong in faith , in love , and in patience .
ERV	Titus	2	3	Also , teach the older women to live the way those who serve the Lord should live . They should not go around saying bad things about others or be in the habit of drinking too much . They should teach what is good .
ERV	Titus	2	4	By doing this they will teach the younger women to love their husbands and children .
ERV	Titus	2	5	They will teach them to be wise and pure , to take care of their homes , to be kind , and to be willing to serve their husbands . Then no one will be able to criticize the teaching God gave us .
ERV	Titus	2	6	In the same way , tell the young men to be wise .
ERV	Titus	2	7	You should be an example for them in every way by the good things you do . When you teach , be honest and serious .
ERV	Titus	2	8	And your teaching should be clearly right so that you can not be criticized . Then anyone who is against you will be ashamed . There will not be anything bad they can say about us .
ERV	Titus	2	9	And tell this to those who are slaves : They should be willing to serve their masters at all times ; they should try to please them , not argue with them ;
ERV	Titus	2	10	they should not steal from them ; and they should show their masters that they can be trusted . Then , in everything they do , they will show that the teaching of God our Savior is good .
ERV	Titus	2	11	That is the way we should live , because God ’ s grace has come . That grace can save everyone .
ERV	Titus	2	12	It teaches us not to live against God and not to do the bad things the world wants to do . It teaches us to live on earth now in a wise and right way—a way that shows true devotion to God .
ERV	Titus	2	13	We should live like that while we are waiting for the coming of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ . He is our great hope , and he will come with glory .
ERV	Titus	2	14	He gave himself for us . He died to free us from all evil . He died to make us pure—people who belong only to him and who always want to do good .
ERV	Titus	2	15	These are the things you should tell people . Encourage them , and when they are wrong , correct them . You have full authority to do this , so don ’ t let anyone think they can ignore you .
ERV	Titus	3	3	In the past we were foolish too . We did not obey , we were wrong , and we were slaves to the many things our bodies wanted and enjoyed . We lived doing evil and being jealous . People hated us and we hated each other .
ERV	Titus	3	2	Tell them not to speak evil of anyone but to live in peace with others . They should be gentle and polite to everyone .
ERV	Titus	3	4	But then the kindness and love of God our Savior was made known .
ERV	Titus	3	5	He saved us because of his mercy , not because of any good things we did . He saved us through the washing that made us new people . He saved us by making us new through the Holy Spirit .
ERV	Titus	3	6	God poured out to us that Holy Spirit fully through Jesus Christ our Savior .
ERV	Titus	3	7	We were made right with God by his grace . God saved us so that we could be his children and look forward to receiving life that never ends .
ERV	Titus	3	8	This is a true statement . And I want you to be sure that the people understand these things . Then those who believe in God will be careful to use their lives for doing good . These things are good and will help everyone .
ERV	Titus	3	9	Stay away from those who have foolish arguments , who talk about useless family histories , or who make trouble and fight about what the Law of Moses teaches . These things are useless and will not help anyone .
ERV	Titus	3	10	Give a warning to all those who cause arguments . If they continue to cause trouble after a second warning , then don ’ t associate with them .
ERV	Titus	3	11	You know that people like that are evil and sinful . Their sins prove they are wrong . Final Instructions and Greetings
ERV	Titus	3	12	I will send Artemas and Tychicus to you . When I send them , try hard to come to me at Nicopolis . I have decided to stay there this winter .
ERV	Titus	3	13	Zenas the lawyer and Apollos will be traveling from there . Do all that you can to help them prepare for their trip . Be sure that they have everything they need .
ERV	Titus	3	14	Our people must learn to use their lives for doing good and helping anyone who has a need . Then they will not have empty lives .
ERV	Titus	3	15	All the people with me here send you their greetings . Give my greetings to those who love us in the faith . Grace be with you all .
ERV	Philemon	1	1	Greetings from Paul , a prisoner for Jesus Christ , and from Timothy , our brother . To Philemon , our dear friend and worker with us .
ERV	Philemon	1	2	Also to our sister Apphia , to Archippus , who serves with us in the Lord ’ s army , and to the church that meets in your home .
ERV	Philemon	1	3	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Philemon ’ s Love and Faith
ERV	Philemon	1	4	I remember you in my prayers . And I always thank my God for you .
ERV	Philemon	1	5	I thank God because I hear about the love you have for all of God ’ s holy people and the faith you have in the Lord Jesus .
ERV	Philemon	1	6	I pray that the faith you share will make you understand every blessing we have in Christ .
ERV	Philemon	1	7	My brother , you have shown love to God ’ s people , and your help has greatly encouraged them . What a great joy and encouragement that has been to me . Accept Onesimus as a Brother
ERV	Philemon	1	8	There is something that you should do . And because of the authority I have in Christ , I feel free to command you to do it .
ERV	Philemon	1	9	But I am not commanding you ; I am asking you to do it out of love . I , Paul , am an old man now , and I am a prisoner for Christ Jesus .
ERV	Philemon	1	10	I am asking you for my son Onesimus . He became my son while I was in prison .
ERV	Philemon	1	11	In the past he was useless to you . But now he has become useful [ a ] for both you and me .
ERV	Philemon	1	12	I am sending him back to you , but it ’ s as hard as losing part of myself .
ERV	Philemon	1	13	I would like to keep him here to help me while I am still in prison for telling the Good News . By helping me here , he would be representing you .
ERV	Philemon	1	14	But I did not want to do anything without asking you first . Then whatever you do for me will be what you want to do , not what I forced you to do .
ERV	Philemon	1	15	Onesimus was separated from you for a short time . Maybe that happened so that you could have him back forever ,
ERV	Philemon	1	16	not to be just a slave , but better than a slave , to be a dear brother . That ’ s what he is to me . And I know he will mean even more to you , both as your slave and as one who shares your faith in the Lord .
ERV	Philemon	1	17	If you accept me as your friend , then accept Onesimus back . Welcome him like you would welcome me .
ERV	Philemon	1	18	If he has done any wrong to you or owes you anything , charge that to me .
ERV	Philemon	1	19	I , Paul , am writing this in my own handwriting : I will pay back anything Onesimus owes . And I will say nothing about what you owe me for your own life .
ERV	Philemon	1	20	So , my brother , as a follower of the Lord please do this favor [ b ] for me . It would be such a great encouragement to me as your brother in Christ .
ERV	Philemon	1	21	I write this letter knowing that you will do what I ask , and even more than I ask .
ERV	Philemon	1	22	Also , please prepare a room for me . I hope that God will answer your prayers and that I will be able to come and see you . Final Greetings
ERV	Philemon	1	23	Epaphras is a prisoner with me for Christ Jesus . He sends you his greetings .
ERV	Philemon	1	24	Also Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke send their greetings . They are workers together with me .
ERV	Philemon	1	25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Footnotes - Philemon 1:11 useless … useful Paul here makes a play on words with the name Onesimus , which means “ useful. ” - Philemon 1:20 please do this favor Paul here makes another wordplay on the name Onesimus , using a verb related to it .
ERV	Hebrews	1	1	In the past God spoke to our people through the prophets . He spoke to them many times and in many different ways .
ERV	Hebrews	1	2	And now in these last days , God has spoken to us again through his Son . He made the whole world through his Son . And he has chosen his Son to have all things .
ERV	Hebrews	1	3	The Son shows the glory of God . He is a perfect copy of God ’ s nature , and he holds everything together by his powerful command . The Son made people clean from their sins . Then he sat down at the right side [ a ] of God , the Great One in heaven .
ERV	Hebrews	1	4	The Son became much greater than the angels , and God gave him a name that is much greater than any of their names .
ERV	Hebrews	1	5	God never said this to any of the angels : “ You are my Son . Today I have become your Father. ” ( A ) God also never said about an angel , “ I will be his Father , and he will be my son. ” ( B )
ERV	Hebrews	1	6	And then , when God presents his firstborn Son to the world , [ b ] he says , “ Let all God ’ s angels worship him. ” [ c ]
ERV	Hebrews	1	7	This is what God said about the angels :
ERV	Hebrews	1	8	But this is what he said about his Son : “ God , your kingdom will last forever and ever . You use your authority for justice .
ERV	Hebrews	1	9	You love what is right and hate what is wrong . So God , your God , has chosen you , giving you more honor and joy than anyone like you. ” ( D )
ERV	Hebrews	1	10	God also said , “ O Lord , in the beginning you made the earth , and your hands made the sky .
ERV	Hebrews	1	11	These things will disappear , but you will stay . They will all wear out like old clothes .
ERV	Hebrews	1	12	You will fold them up like a coat , and they will be changed like clothes . But you never change , and your life will never end. ” ( E )
ERV	Hebrews	1	13	And God never said this to an angel :
ERV	Hebrews	1	14	All the angels are spirits who serve God and are sent to help those who will receive salvation . Footnotes - Hebrews 1:3 right side The place of honor and authority ( power ) . - Hebrews 1:6 world This may mean the world into which Jesus was born ( see Lk . 2:1-14 ) , or it may have the same meaning as in Heb . 2:5—the world to come , to which the risen Christ is presented as king ( see Php . 2:9-11 ) . - Hebrews 1:6 “ Let … him ” These words are found in Deut . 32:43 in the ancient Greek version and in a Hebrew scroll from Qumran . - Hebrews 1:7 winds This can also mean “ spirits. ” - Hebrews 1:13 until I put … power Literally , “ until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet . ”
ERV	Hebrews	2	2	The teaching that God spoke through angels was shown to be true . And every time his people did something against that teaching , they were punished for what they did . They were punished when they did not obey that teaching .
ERV	Hebrews	2	3	So surely we also will be punished if we don ’ t pay attention to the salvation we have that is so great . It was the Lord Jesus who first told people about it . And those who heard him proved to us that it is true .
ERV	Hebrews	2	4	God also proved it by using miraculous signs , wonders , and all kinds of miracles . And he proved it by giving people various gifts through the Holy Spirit in just the way he wanted . Christ Became Like People to Save Them
ERV	Hebrews	2	5	God did not choose angels to be the rulers over the new world that was coming . That future world is the world we have been talking about .
ERV	Hebrews	2	6	It is written some place in the Scriptures , “ Why are people so important to you ? Why do you even think about them ? Why do you care about the son of man [ a ] ? Is he so important ?
ERV	Hebrews	2	7	For a short time you made him lower than the angels . You crowned him with glory and honor .
ERV	Hebrews	2	8	You put everything under his control . [ b ] ” ( A ) If God put everything under his control , then there was nothing left that he did not rule . But we don ’ t yet see him ruling over everything .
ERV	Hebrews	2	9	For a short time Jesus was made lower than the angels , but now we see him wearing a crown of glory and honor because he suffered and died . Because of God ’ s grace , Jesus died for everyone .
ERV	Hebrews	2	10	God—the one who made all things and for whose glory all things exist—wanted many people to be his children and share his glory . So he did what he needed to do . He made perfect the one who leads those people to salvation . He made Jesus a perfect Savior through his suffering .
ERV	Hebrews	2	11	Jesus , the one who makes people holy , and those who are made holy are from the same family . So he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters .
ERV	Hebrews	2	12	He says , “ God , I will tell my brothers and sisters about you . Before all your people I will sing your praises. ” ( B )
ERV	Hebrews	2	13	He also says , “ I will trust in God. ” ( C ) And he says , “ I am here , and with me are the children God has given me. ” ( D )
ERV	Hebrews	2	14	These children are people with physical bodies . So Jesus himself became like them and had the same experiences they have . Jesus did this so that , by dying , he could destroy the one who has the power of death—the devil .
ERV	Hebrews	2	15	Jesus became like these people and died so that he could free them . They were like slaves all their lives because of their fear of death .
ERV	Hebrews	2	16	Clearly , it is not angels that Jesus helps . He helps the people who are from Abraham .
ERV	Hebrews	2	17	For this reason , Jesus had to be made like us , his brothers and sisters , in every way . He became like people so that he could be their merciful and faithful high priest in service to God . Then he could bring forgiveness for the people ’ s sins .
ERV	Hebrews	2	18	And now he can help those who are tempted . He is able to help because he himself suffered and was tempted . Footnotes - Hebrews 2:6 son of man This can mean any human , but the name “ Son of Man ” ( see “ Son of Man ” in the Word List ) is often used to mean Jesus , who showed what God planned for all people to be . - Hebrews 2:8 control Literally , “ feet . ”
ERV	Hebrews	3	3	When someone builds a house , people will honor the builder more than the house . It is the same with Jesus . He should have more honor than Moses .
ERV	Hebrews	3	2	God made him our high priest , and he was faithful to God just as Moses was . He did everything God wanted him to do in God ’ s house .
ERV	Hebrews	3	4	Every house is built by someone , but God built everything .
ERV	Hebrews	3	5	Moses was faithful as a servant in God ’ s whole house . He told people what God would say in the future .
ERV	Hebrews	3	6	But Christ is faithful in ruling God ’ s house as the Son . And we are God ’ s house , if we remain confident of the great hope we are glad to say we have . We Must Continue to Follow God
ERV	Hebrews	3	7	. It means it is important to do this now , while there is still opportunity .
ERV	Hebrews	3	8	don ’ t be stubborn as you were in the past , when you turned against God . That was the day you tested God in the desert .
ERV	Hebrews	3	9	For
ERV	Hebrews	3	40	years ? He was angry with those who sinned . And their dead bodies were left in the desert .
ERV	Hebrews	3	10	So I was angry with them . I said , ‘ Their thoughts are always wrong . They have never understood my ways. ’
ERV	Hebrews	3	11	So I was angry and made a promise : ‘ They will never enter my place of rest. ’ ” ( A )
ERV	Hebrews	3	12	So , brothers and sisters , be careful that none of you has the evil thoughts that cause so much doubt that you stop following the living God .
ERV	Hebrews	3	13	But encourage each other every day , while you still have something called “ today . [ a ] ” Help each other so that none of you will be fooled by sin and become too hard to change .
ERV	Hebrews	3	14	We have the honor of sharing in all that Christ has if we continue until the end to have the sure faith we had in the beginning .
ERV	Hebrews	3	15	That ’ s why the Spirit said , “ If you hear God ’ s voice today , don ’ t be stubborn as in the past when you turned against God. ” ( B )
ERV	Hebrews	3	16	Who were those who heard God ’ s voice and turned against him ? It was all the people Moses led out of Egypt .
ERV	Hebrews	3	17	And who was God angry with for
ERV	Hebrews	3	18	And which people was God talking to when he promised that they would never enter his place of rest ? He was talking to those who did not obey him .
ERV	Hebrews	3	19	So we see that they were not allowed to enter and have God ’ s rest , because they did not believe . Footnotes - Hebrews 3:13 today This word is taken from verse
ERV	Hebrews	4	4	Yes , somewhere in the Scriptures he talked about the seventh day of the week . He said , “ So on the seventh day God rested from all his work. ” [ a ]
ERV	Hebrews	4	2	Yes , the good news about it was told to us just as it was to them . But the message they heard did not help them . They heard it but did not accept it with faith .
ERV	Hebrews	4	3	Only we who believe it are able to enter God ’ s place of rest . As God said , “ I was angry and made a promise : ‘ They will never enter my place of rest. ’ ” ( A ) But God ’ s work was finished from the time he made the world .
ERV	Hebrews	4	5	But in the Scripture above God said , “ They will never enter my place of rest. ”
ERV	Hebrews	4	6	So the opportunity is still there for some to enter and enjoy God ’ s rest . But those who first heard the good news about it did not enter , because they did not obey .
ERV	Hebrews	4	7	So God planned another special day . It is called “ today. ” He spoke about that day through David a long time later using the words we quoted before : “ If you hear God ’ s voice today , don ’ t be stubborn. ” ( B )
ERV	Hebrews	4	8	We know that Joshua did not lead the people into the place of rest that God promised . We know this because God spoke later about another day for rest .
ERV	Hebrews	4	9	This shows that the seventh-day rest [ b ] for God ’ s people is still to come .
ERV	Hebrews	4	10	God rested after he finished his work . So everyone who enters God ’ s place of rest will also have rest from their own work just as God did .
ERV	Hebrews	4	11	So let us try as hard as we can to enter God ’ s place of rest . We must try hard so that none of us will be lost by following the example of those who refused to obey God .
ERV	Hebrews	4	12	God ’ s word [ c ] is alive and working . It is sharper than the sharpest sword and cuts all the way into us . It cuts deep to the place where the soul and the spirit are joined . God ’ s word cuts to the center of our joints and our bones . It judges the thoughts and feelings in our hearts .
ERV	Hebrews	4	13	Nothing in all the world can be hidden from God . He can clearly see all things . Everything is open before him . And to him we must explain the way we have lived . Jesus Christ Is Our High Priest
ERV	Hebrews	4	14	We have a great high priest who has gone to live with God in heaven . He is Jesus the Son of God . So let us continue to express our faith in him .
ERV	Hebrews	4	15	Jesus , our high priest , is able to understand our weaknesses . When Jesus lived on earth , he was tempted in every way . He was tempted in the same ways we are tempted , but he never sinned .
ERV	Hebrews	4	16	With Jesus as our high priest , we can feel free to come before God ’ s throne where there is grace . There we receive mercy and kindness to help us when we need it . Footnotes - Hebrews 4:4 Quote from Gen. 2:2 . - Hebrews 4:9 seventh-day rest Literally , “ Sabbath rest , ” meaning a sharing in the rest God began after he created the world . - Hebrews 4:12 God ’ s word God ’ s teachings and commands .
ERV	Hebrews	5	5	It is the same with Christ . He did not choose himself to have the honor of becoming a high priest . But God chose him . God said to him , “ You are my Son . Today I have become your Father. ” ( A )
ERV	Hebrews	5	2	The high priest has his own weaknesses . So he is able to be gentle with those who do wrong out of ignorance .
ERV	Hebrews	5	3	He offers sacrifices for their sins , but he must also offer sacrifices for his own sins .
ERV	Hebrews	5	4	To be a high priest is an honor . But no one chooses himself for this work . That person must be chosen by God just as Aaron was .
ERV	Hebrews	5	6	And in another part of the Scriptures God says , “ You are a priest forever— the kind of priest Melchizedek was. ” ( B )
ERV	Hebrews	5	7	While Jesus lived on earth he prayed to God , asking for help from the one who could save him from death . He prayed to God with loud cries and tears . And his prayers were answered because of his great respect for God .
ERV	Hebrews	5	8	Jesus was the Son of God , but he still suffered , and through his sufferings he learned to obey whatever God says .
ERV	Hebrews	5	9	This made him the perfect high priest , who provides the way for everyone who obeys him to be saved forever .
ERV	Hebrews	5	10	God made him high priest , just like Melchizedek . Warning Against Falling Away
ERV	Hebrews	5	11	We have many things to tell you about this . But it is hard to explain because you have stopped trying to understand .
ERV	Hebrews	5	12	You have had enough time that by now you should be teachers . But you need someone to teach you again the first lessons of God ’ s teaching . You still need the teaching that is like milk . You are not ready for solid food .
ERV	Hebrews	5	13	Anyone who lives on milk is still a baby and is not able to understand much about living right .
ERV	Hebrews	5	14	But solid food is for people who have grown up . From their experience they have learned to see the difference between good and evil .
ERV	Hebrews	6	6	So we should be finished with the beginning lessons about Christ . We should not have to keep going back to where we started . We began our new life by turning away from the evil we did in the past and by believing in God . That ’ s when we were taught about baptisms , [ a ] laying hands on people , [ b ] the resurrection of those who have died , and the final judgment . Now we need to go forward to more mature teaching .
ERV	Hebrews	6	3	And that ’ s what we will do if God allows . 4-6 After people have left the way of Christ , can you make them change their lives again ? I am talking about people who once learned the truth , received God ’ s gift , and shared in the Holy Spirit . They were blessed to hear God ’ s good message and see the great power of his new world . But then they left it all behind , and it is not possible to make them change again . That ’ s because those who leave Christ are nailing him to the cross again , shaming him before everyone .
ERV	Hebrews	6	7	Some people are like land that gets plenty of rain and produces a good crop for those who farm it . That kind of land has God ’ s blessing .
ERV	Hebrews	6	8	But other people are like land that grows only thorns and weeds . It is worthless and in danger of being cursed by God . It will be destroyed by fire .
ERV	Hebrews	6	9	Dear friends , I am not saying this because I think it is happening to you . We really expect that you will do better—that you will do the good things that will result in your salvation .
ERV	Hebrews	6	10	God is fair , and he will remember all the work you have done . He will remember that you showed your love to him by helping his people and that you continue to help them .
ERV	Hebrews	6	11	We want each of you to be willing and eager to show your love like that the rest of your life . Then you will be sure to get what you hope for .
ERV	Hebrews	6	12	We don ’ t want you to be lazy . We want you to be like those who , because of their faith and patience , will get what God has promised .
ERV	Hebrews	6	13	God made a promise to Abraham . And there is no one greater than God , so he made the promise with an oath in his own name—an oath that he would do what he promised .
ERV	Hebrews	6	14	He said , “ I will surely bless you . I will give you many descendants. ” [ c ]
ERV	Hebrews	6	15	Abraham waited patiently for this to happen , and later he received what God promised .
ERV	Hebrews	6	16	People always use the name of someone greater than themselves to make a promise with an oath . The oath proves that what they say is true , and there is no more arguing about it .
ERV	Hebrews	6	17	God wanted to prove that his promise was true . He wanted to prove this to those who would get what he promised . He wanted them to understand clearly that his purposes never change . So God said something would happen , and he proved what he said by adding an oath .
ERV	Hebrews	6	18	These two things can not change : God can not lie when he says something , and he can not lie when he makes an oath . So these two things are a great help to us who have come to God for safety . They encourage us to hold on to the hope that is ours .
ERV	Hebrews	6	19	This hope is like an anchor for us . It is strong and sure and keeps us safe . It goes behind the curtain . [ d ]
ERV	Hebrews	6	20	Jesus has already entered there and opened the way for us . He has become the high priest forever , just like Melchizedek . Footnotes - Hebrews 6:1 baptisms The word here may mean the baptism ( brief ‘ burial ’ in water ) of believers in Christ , or it may mean Jewish ceremonial washings . - Hebrews 6:1 laying hands on people This act was a way of asking God to bless people in a special way—to heal them , to cause the Holy Spirit to come into them , or to give them power for a special work . - Hebrews 6:14 Quote from Gen. 22:17 . - Hebrews 6:19 curtain The spiritual curtain in the heavenly temple , which was symbolized by the physical one that separated the inner sanctuary ( and God ’ s presence ) from the other room in the Holy Tent and in the Jerusalem Temple . See “ curtain ” in the Word List . Also in 10:20 .
ERV	Hebrews	7	7	And everyone knows that the more important person always blesses the less important person .
ERV	Hebrews	7	2	Then Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he had . The name Melchizedek , king of Salem , has two meanings . First , Melchizedek means “ king of justice. ” And “ king of Salem ” means “ king of peace. ”
ERV	Hebrews	7	3	No one knows who his father or mother was or where he came from . [ a ] And no one knows when he was born or when he died . Melchizedek is like the Son of God in that he will always be a priest .
ERV	Hebrews	7	4	You can see that Melchizedek was very great . Abraham , our great ancestor , gave him a tenth of everything he won in battle .
ERV	Hebrews	7	5	Now the law says that those from the tribe of Levi who become priests must get a tenth from their own people , even though they and their people are both from the family of Abraham .
ERV	Hebrews	7	6	Melchizedek was not even from the tribe of Levi , but Abraham gave him a tenth of what he had . And Melchizedek blessed Abraham—the one who had God ’ s promises .
ERV	Hebrews	7	8	Those priests get a tenth , but they are only men who live and then die . But Melchizedek , who got a tenth from Abraham , continues to live , as the Scriptures say .
ERV	Hebrews	7	9	Now those from the family of Levi are the ones who get a tenth from the people . But we can say that when Abraham paid Melchizedek a tenth , then Levi also paid it .
ERV	Hebrews	7	10	Levi was not yet born , but he already existed in his ancestor Abraham when Melchizedek met him .
ERV	Hebrews	7	11	The people were given the law under the system of priests from the tribe of Levi . But no one could be made spiritually perfect through that system of priests . So there was a need for another priest to come . I mean a priest like Melchizedek , not Aaron .
ERV	Hebrews	7	12	And when a different kind of priest comes , then the law must be changed too . 13-14 We are talking about our Lord Christ , who belonged to a different tribe . No one from that tribe ever served as a priest at the altar . It is clear that Christ came from the tribe of Judah . And Moses said nothing about priests belonging to that tribe . Jesus Is a Priest Like Melchizedek
ERV	Hebrews	7	15	And these things become even clearer when we see that another priest has come who is like Melchizedek .
ERV	Hebrews	7	16	He was made a priest , but not because he met the requirement of being born into the right family . He became a priest by the power of a life that will never end .
ERV	Hebrews	7	17	This is what the Scriptures say about him : “ You are a priest forever—the kind of priest Melchizedek was. ” [ b ]
ERV	Hebrews	7	18	The old rule is now ended because it was weak and worthless .
ERV	Hebrews	7	19	The Law of Moses could not make anything perfect . But now a better hope has been given to us . And with that hope we can come near to God .
ERV	Hebrews	7	20	Also , it is important that God made a promise with an oath when he made Jesus high priest . When those other men became priests , there was no oath .
ERV	Hebrews	7	21	But Christ became a priest with God ’ s oath . God said to him , “ The Lord has made a promise with an oath and will not change his mind : ‘ You are a priest forever. ’ ” ( A )
ERV	Hebrews	7	22	So this means that Jesus is the guarantee of a better agreement from God to his people .
ERV	Hebrews	7	23	Also , when one of those other priests died , he could not continue being a priest . So there were many of those priests .
ERV	Hebrews	7	24	But Jesus lives forever . He will never stop serving as a priest .
ERV	Hebrews	7	25	So Christ can save those who come to God through him . Christ can do this forever , because he always lives and is ready to help people when they come before God .
ERV	Hebrews	7	26	So Jesus is the kind of high priest we need . He is holy . He has no sin in him . He is pure and not influenced by sinners . And he is raised above the heavens .
ERV	Hebrews	7	27	He is not like those other priests . They had to offer sacrifices every day , first for their own sins , and then for the sins of the people . But Jesus doesn ’ t need to do that . He offered only one sacrifice for all time . He offered himself .
ERV	Hebrews	7	28	The law chooses high priests who are men and have the same weaknesses that all people have . But after the law , God spoke the oath that made his Son high priest . And that Son , made perfect through suffering , will serve forever . Footnotes - Hebrews 7:3 No one … came from Literally , “ Melchizedek was without father , without mother , without genealogy. ” - Hebrews 7:17 Quote from Ps . 110:4 .
ERV	Hebrews	8	8	But God found something wrong with the people . He said , “ The time is coming , says the Lord , when I will give a new agreement to the people of Israel and to the people of Judah .
ERV	Hebrews	8	2	Our high priest serves in the Most Holy Place . [ b ] He serves in the true place of worship [ c ] that was made by God , not by anyone here on earth .
ERV	Hebrews	8	3	Every high priest has the work of offering gifts and sacrifices to God . So our high priest must also offer something to God .
ERV	Hebrews	8	4	If our high priest were now living on earth , he would not be a priest . I say this because there are already priests here who follow the law by offering gifts to God .
ERV	Hebrews	8	5	The work that these priests do is really only a copy and a shadow of what is in heaven . That is why God warned Moses when he was ready to build the Holy Tent : “ Be sure to make everything exactly like the pattern I showed you on the mountain. ” [ d ]
ERV	Hebrews	8	6	But the work that has been given to Jesus is much greater than the work that was given to those priests . In the same way , the new agreement that Jesus brought from God to his people is much greater than the old one . And the new agreement is based on better promises .
ERV	Hebrews	8	7	If there was nothing wrong with the first agreement , then there would be no need for a second agreement .
ERV	Hebrews	8	9	It will not be like the agreement that I gave to their fathers . That is the agreement I gave when I took them by the hand and led them out of Egypt . They did not continue following the agreement I gave them , and I turned away from them , says the Lord .
ERV	Hebrews	8	10	This is the new agreement I will give the people of Israel . I will give this agreement in the future , says the Lord : I will put my laws in their minds , and I will write my laws on their hearts . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
ERV	Hebrews	8	11	Never again will anyone have to teach their neighbors or their family to know the Lord . All people—the greatest and the least important—will know me .
ERV	Hebrews	8	12	And I will forgive the wrongs they have done , and I will not remember their sins. ” ( A )
ERV	Hebrews	8	13	God called this a new agreement , so he has made the first agreement old . And anything that is old and useless is ready to disappear .

ERV	Hebrews	9	9	This is an example for us today . It shows that the gifts and sacrifices the priests offer to God are not able to make the consciences of the worshipers completely clear .
ERV	Hebrews	9	2	This place was inside a tent . The first area in the tent was called the Holy Place . In the Holy Place were the lamp and the table with the special bread offered to God .
ERV	Hebrews	9	3	Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place .
ERV	Hebrews	9	4	In the Most Holy Place was a golden altar for burning incense . And also there was the Box of the Agreement . The Box was covered with gold . Inside this Box was a golden jar of manna and Aaron ’ s rod—the rod that once grew leaves . Also in the Box were the flat stones with the Ten Commandments of the old agreement on them .
ERV	Hebrews	9	5	Above the Box were the Cherub angels that showed God ’ s glory . These Cherub angels were over the place of mercy . [ a ] But we can not say everything about this now .
ERV	Hebrews	9	6	Everything in the tent was made ready in the way I have explained . Then the priests went into the first room every day to do their worship duties .
ERV	Hebrews	9	7	But only the high priest could go into the second room , and he went in only once a year . Also , he could never enter that room without taking blood with him . He offered that blood to God for himself and for the sins the people committed without knowing they were sinning .
ERV	Hebrews	9	8	The Holy Spirit uses those two separate rooms to teach us that the way into the Most Holy Place [ b ] was not open while the first room was still there .
ERV	Hebrews	9	10	These gifts and sacrifices are only about food and drink and special washings . They are only rules about the body . God gave them for his people to follow until the time of his new way . Worship Under the New Agreement
ERV	Hebrews	9	11	But Christ has already come to be the high priest . He is the high priest of the good things we now have . But Christ does not serve in a place like the tent that those other priests served in . He serves in a better place . Unlike that tent , this one is perfect . It was not made by anyone here on earth . It does not belong to this world .
ERV	Hebrews	9	12	,
ERV	Hebrews	9	13	The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a cow were sprinkled on those who were no longer pure enough to enter the place of worship . The blood and ashes made them pure again—but only their bodies .
ERV	Hebrews	9	14	So surely the blood sacrifice of Christ can do much more . Christ offered himself through the eternal Spirit [ c ] as a perfect sacrifice to God . His blood will make us completely clean from the evil we have done . It will give us clear consciences so that we can worship the living God .
ERV	Hebrews	9	15	So Christ brings a new agreement from God to his people . He brings this agreement so that those who are chosen by God can have the blessings God promised , blessings that last forever . This can happen only because Christ died to free people from sins committed against the commands of the first agreement .
ERV	Hebrews	9	16	When someone dies and leaves a will , there must be proof that the one who wrote the will is dead .
ERV	Hebrews	9	17	A will means nothing while the one who wrote it is still living . It can be used only after that person ’ s death .
ERV	Hebrews	9	18	That is why blood was needed to begin the first agreement between God and his people .
ERV	Hebrews	9	19	First , Moses told the people every command in the law . Then he took the blood of young bulls and mixed it with water . He used red wool and a branch of hyssop to sprinkle the blood and water on the book of the law and on all the people .
ERV	Hebrews	9	20	Then he said , “ This is the blood that makes the agreement good—the agreement that God commanded you to follow. ” [ d ]
ERV	Hebrews	9	21	In the same way , Moses sprinkled the blood on the Holy Tent . He sprinkled the blood over everything used in worship .
ERV	Hebrews	9	22	The law says that almost everything must be made clean by blood . Sins can not be forgiven without a blood sacrifice . Jesus Christ Is Our Sacrifice for Sin
ERV	Hebrews	9	23	These things are copies of the real things that are in heaven . These copies had to be made clean by animal sacrifices . But the real things in heaven must have much better sacrifices .
ERV	Hebrews	9	24	. - Hebrews 9:14 Spirit Probably the Holy Spirit . See “ Holy Spirit ” in the Word List . - Hebrews 9:20 Quote from Ex . 24:8 .
ERV	Hebrews	9	25	The high priest enters the Most Holy Place once every year . He takes with him blood to offer . But he does not offer his own blood like Christ did . Christ went into heaven , but not to offer himself many times like the high priest offers blood again and again .
ERV	Hebrews	9	26	If Christ had offered himself many times , he would have needed to suffer many times since the time the world was made . But he came to offer himself only once . And that once is enough for all time . He came at a time when the world is nearing an end . He came to take away all sin by offering himself as a sacrifice .
ERV	Hebrews	9	27	Everyone must die once . Then they are judged .
ERV	Hebrews	9	28	So Christ was offered as a sacrifice one time to take away the sins of many people . And he will come a second time , but not to offer himself for sin . He will come the second time to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him . Footnotes - Hebrews 9:5 place of mercy Or “ mercy seat , ” a place on top of the “ Box of the Agreement , ” where the high priest put the blood of an animal once a year to pay for the sins of the people . - Hebrews 9:8 Most Holy Place Literally , “ holies ” for “ holy of holies , ” the spiritual place where God lives and is worshiped . Also in verses
ERV	Hebrews	10	10	Jesus Christ did the things God wanted him to do . And because of that , we are made holy through the sacrifice of Christ ’ s body . Christ made that sacrifice one time—enough for all time .
ERV	Hebrews	10	2	If the law could make people perfect , those sacrifices would have already stopped . They would already be clean from their sins , and they would not still feel guilty .
ERV	Hebrews	10	3	But that ’ s not what happens . Their sacrifices make them remember their sins every year ,
ERV	Hebrews	10	4	because it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
ERV	Hebrews	10	5	So when Christ came into the world he said , “ You don ’ t want sacrifices and offerings , but you have prepared a body for me .
ERV	Hebrews	10	6	You are not pleased with the sacrifices of animals killed and burned or with offerings to take away sins .
ERV	Hebrews	10	7	Then I said , ‘ Here I am , God . It is written about me in the book of the law . I have come to do what you want. ’ ” ( A )
ERV	Hebrews	10	8	Christ first said , “ You don ’ t want sacrifices and offerings . You are not pleased with animals killed and burned or with sacrifices to take away sin. ” ( These are all sacrifices that the law commands . )
ERV	Hebrews	10	9	Then he said , “ Here I am , God . I have come to do what you want. ” So God ends that first system of sacrifices and starts his new way .
ERV	Hebrews	10	11	Every day the priests stand and do their religious service . Again and again they offer the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins .
ERV	Hebrews	10	12	But Christ offered only one sacrifice for sins , and that sacrifice is good for all time . Then he sat down at the right side of God .
ERV	Hebrews	10	13	And now Christ waits there for his enemies to be put under his power . [ a ]
ERV	Hebrews	10	14	With one sacrifice Christ made his people perfect forever . They are the ones who are being made holy .
ERV	Hebrews	10	15	The Holy Spirit also tells us about this . First he says ,
ERV	Hebrews	10	16	“ This is the agreement [ b ] I will make with my people in the future , says the Lord . I will put my laws in their hearts . I will write my laws in their minds. ” ( B )
ERV	Hebrews	10	17	Then he says , “ I will forget their sins and never again remember the evil they have done. ” ( C )
ERV	Hebrews	10	18	And after everything is forgiven , there is no more need for a sacrifice to pay for sins . Come Near to God
ERV	Hebrews	10	19	And so , brothers and sisters , we are completely free to enter the Most Holy Place . [ c ] We can do this without fear because of the blood sacrifice of Jesus .
ERV	Hebrews	10	20	We enter through a new way that Jesus opened for us . It is a living way that leads through the curtain—Christ ’ s body .
ERV	Hebrews	10	21	And we have a great priest who rules the house of God .
ERV	Hebrews	10	22	Sprinkled with the blood of Christ , our hearts have been made free from a guilty conscience , and our bodies have been washed with pure water . So come near to God with a sincere heart , full of confidence because of our faith in Christ .
ERV	Hebrews	10	23	We must hold on to the hope we have , never hesitating to tell people about it . We can trust God to do what he promised . Help Each Other Be Strong
ERV	Hebrews	10	24	We should think about each other to see how we can encourage each other to show love and do good works .
ERV	Hebrews	10	25	We must not quit meeting together , as some are doing . No , we need to keep on encouraging each other . This becomes more and more important as you see the Day getting closer . Don ’ t Turn Away From God ’ s Son
ERV	Hebrews	10	26	If we decide to continue sinning after we have learned the truth , then there is no other sacrifice that will take away sins .
ERV	Hebrews	10	27	If we continue sinning , all that is left for us is a fearful time of waiting for the judgment and the angry fire that will destroy those who live against God .
ERV	Hebrews	10	28	Whoever refused to obey the Law of Moses was found guilty from the testimony given by two or three witnesses . Such people were not forgiven . They were killed .
ERV	Hebrews	10	29	So think how much more punishment people deserve who show their hate for the Son of God—people who show they have no respect for the blood sacrifice that began the new agreement and once made them holy or who insult the Spirit of God ’ s grace .
ERV	Hebrews	10	30	We know that God said , “ I will punish people for the wrongs they do ; I will repay them. ” [ d ] And he also said , “ The Lord will judge his people. ” [ e ]
ERV	Hebrews	10	31	It is a terrible thing to face punishment from the living God . Keep the Courage and Patience You Had
ERV	Hebrews	10	32	Remember the days when you first learned the truth . You had a hard struggle with much suffering , but you continued strong .
ERV	Hebrews	10	33	Sometimes people said hateful things to you and mistreated you in public . And sometimes you helped others who were being treated that same way .
ERV	Hebrews	10	34	Yes , you helped them in prison and shared in their suffering . And you were still happy when everything you owned was taken away from you . You continued to be happy , because you knew that you had something much better—something that would continue forever .
ERV	Hebrews	10	35	So don ’ t lose the courage that you had in the past . Your courage will be rewarded richly .
ERV	Hebrews	10	36	You must be patient . After you have done what God wants , you will get what he promised you .
ERV	Hebrews	10	37	He says , “ Very soon now , the one who is coming will come and will not be late .
ERV	Hebrews	10	38	The person who is right with me will live by trusting in me . But I will not be pleased with the one who turns back in fear. ” ( D )
ERV	Hebrews	10	39	But we are not those who turn back and are lost . No , we are the people who have faith and are saved .

ERV	Hebrews	11	11	Sarah was not able to have children , and Abraham was too old . But he had faith in God , trusting him to do what he promised . And so God made them able to have children .
ERV	Hebrews	11	2	God was pleased with the people who lived a long time ago because they had faith like this .
ERV	Hebrews	11	3	Faith helps us understand that God created the whole world by his command . This means that the things we see were made by something that can not be seen .
ERV	Hebrews	11	4	Cain and Abel both offered sacrifices to God . But Abel offered a better sacrifice to God because he had faith . God said he was pleased with what Abel offered . And so God called him a good man because he had faith . Abel died , but through his faith he is still speaking .
ERV	Hebrews	11	5	Enoch was carried away from this earth , so he never died . The Scriptures tell us that before he was carried off , he was a man who pleased God . Later , no one knew where he was , because God had taken Enoch to be with him . This all happened because he had faith .
ERV	Hebrews	11	6	Without faith no one can please God . Whoever comes to God must believe that he is real and that he rewards those who sincerely try to find him .
ERV	Hebrews	11	7	Noah was warned by God about things that he could not yet see . But he had faith and respect for God , so he built a large boat to save his family . With his faith , Noah showed that the world was wrong . And he became one of those who are made right with God through faith .
ERV	Hebrews	11	8	God called Abraham to travel to another place that he promised to give him . Abraham did not know where that other place was . But he obeyed God and started traveling because he had faith .
ERV	Hebrews	11	9	Abraham lived in the country that God promised to give him . He lived there like a visitor who did not belong . He did this because he had faith . He lived in tents with Isaac and Jacob , who also received the same promise from God .
ERV	Hebrews	11	10	Abraham was waiting for the city [ a ] that has real foundations . He was waiting for the city that is planned and built by God .
ERV	Hebrews	11	12	Abraham was so old he was almost dead . But from that one man came as many descendants as there are stars in the sky . So many people came from him that they are like grains of sand on the seashore .
ERV	Hebrews	11	13	All these great people continued living with faith until they died . They did not get the things God promised his people . But they were happy just to see those promises coming far in the future . They accepted the fact that they were like visitors and strangers here on earth .
ERV	Hebrews	11	14	When people accept something like that , they show they are waiting for a country that will be their own .
ERV	Hebrews	11	15	If they were thinking about the country they had left , they could have gone back .
ERV	Hebrews	11	16	But they were waiting for a better country—a heavenly country . So God is not ashamed to be called their God . And he has prepared a city for them . 17-18 God tested Abraham ’ s faith . God told him to offer Isaac as a sacrifice . Abraham obeyed because he had faith . He already had the promises from God . And God had already said to him , “ It is through Isaac that your descendants will come. ” [ b ] But Abraham was ready to offer his only son . He did this because he had faith .
ERV	Hebrews	11	19	He believed that God could raise people from death . And really , when God stopped Abraham from killing Isaac , it was as if he got him back from death .
ERV	Hebrews	11	20	Isaac blessed the future of Jacob and Esau . He did that because he had faith .
ERV	Hebrews	11	21	And Jacob , also because he had faith , blessed each one of Joseph ’ s sons . He did this while he was dying , leaning on his rod and worshiping God .
ERV	Hebrews	11	22	And when Joseph was almost dead , he spoke about the people of Israel leaving Egypt . And he told them what they should do with his body . He did this because he had faith .
ERV	Hebrews	11	23	And the mother and father of Moses hid him for three months after he was born . They did this because they had faith . They saw that Moses was a beautiful baby . And they were not afraid to disobey the king ’ s order . 24-25 Moses grew up and became a man . He refused to be called the son of Pharaoh ’ s daughter . He chose not to enjoy the pleasures of sin that last such a short time . Instead , he chose to suffer with God ’ s people . He did this because he had faith .
ERV	Hebrews	11	26	He thought it was better to suffer for the Messiah than to have all the treasures of Egypt . He was waiting for the reward that God would give him .
ERV	Hebrews	11	27	Moses left Egypt because he had faith . He was not afraid of the king ’ s anger . He continued strong as if he could see the God no one can see .
ERV	Hebrews	11	28	Moses prepared the Passover and spread the blood on the doorways of the people of Israel , so that the angel of death [ c ] would not kill their firstborn sons . Moses did this because he had faith .
ERV	Hebrews	11	29	And God ’ s people all walked through the Red Sea as if it were dry land . They were able to do this because they had faith . But when the Egyptians tried to follow them , they were drowned .
ERV	Hebrews	11	30	And the walls of Jericho fell because of the faith of God ’ s people . They marched around the walls for seven days , and then the walls fell .
ERV	Hebrews	11	31	And Rahab , the prostitute , welcomed the Israelite spies like friends . And because of her faith , she was not killed with the ones who refused to obey .
ERV	Hebrews	11	32	Do I need to give you more examples ? I don ’ t have enough time to tell you about Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , David , Samuel , and the prophets .
ERV	Hebrews	11	33	All of them had great faith . And with that faith they defeated kingdoms . They did what was right , and God helped them in the ways he promised . With their faith some people closed the mouths of lions .
ERV	Hebrews	11	34	And some were able to stop blazing fires . Others escaped from being killed with swords . Some who were weak were made strong . They became powerful in battle and defeated other armies .
ERV	Hebrews	11	35	There were women who lost loved ones but got them back when they were raised from death . Others were tortured but refused to accept their freedom . They did this so that they could be raised from death to a better life .
ERV	Hebrews	11	36	Some were laughed at and beaten . Others were tied up and put in prison .
ERV	Hebrews	11	37	They were killed with stones . They were cut in half . They were killed with swords . The only clothes some of them had were sheepskins or goatskins . They were poor , persecuted , and treated badly by others .
ERV	Hebrews	11	38	The world was not good enough for these great people . They had to wander in deserts and mountains , living in caves and holes in the ground .
ERV	Hebrews	11	39	God was pleased with all of them because of their faith . But not one of them received God ’ s great promise .
ERV	Hebrews	11	40	God planned something better for us . He wanted to make us perfect . Of course , he wanted those great people to be made perfect too , but not before we could all enjoy that blessing together .

ERV	Hebrews	12	12	You have become weak , so make yourselves strong again .
ERV	Hebrews	12	2	We must never stop looking to Jesus . He is the leader of our faith , and he is the one who makes our faith complete . He suffered death on a cross . But he accepted the shame of the cross as if it were nothing because of the joy he could see waiting for him . And now he is sitting at the right side of God ’ s throne .
ERV	Hebrews	12	3	Think about Jesus . He patiently endured the angry insults that sinful people were shouting at him . Think about him so that you won ’ t get discouraged and stop trying . God Is Like a Father
ERV	Hebrews	12	4	You are struggling against sin , but you have not had to give up your life for the cause .
ERV	Hebrews	12	5	You are children of God , and he speaks words of comfort to you . You have forgotten these words : “ My child , don ’ t think the Lord ’ s discipline is worth nothing , and don ’ t stop trying when he corrects you .
ERV	Hebrews	12	6	The Lord disciplines everyone he loves ; he punishes everyone he accepts as a child. ” ( A )
ERV	Hebrews	12	7	So accept sufferings like a father ’ s discipline . God does these things to you like a father correcting his children . You know that all children are disciplined by their fathers .
ERV	Hebrews	12	8	So , if you never receive the discipline that every child must have , you are not true children and don ’ t really belong to God .
ERV	Hebrews	12	9	We have all had fathers here on earth who corrected us with discipline . And we respected them . So it is even more important that we accept discipline from the Father of our spirits . If we do this , we will have life .
ERV	Hebrews	12	10	Our fathers on earth disciplined us for a short time in the way they thought was best . But God disciplines us to help us so that we can be holy like him .
ERV	Hebrews	12	11	We don ’ t enjoy discipline when we get it . It is painful . But later , after we have learned our lesson from it , we will enjoy the peace that comes from doing what is right . Be Careful How You Live
ERV	Hebrews	12	13	Live in the right way so that you will be saved and your weakness will not cause you to be lost .
ERV	Hebrews	12	14	Try to live in peace with everyone . And try to keep your lives free from sin . Anyone whose life is not holy will never see the Lord .
ERV	Hebrews	12	15	Be careful that no one fails to get God ’ s grace . Be careful that no one loses their faith and becomes like a bitter weed growing among you . Someone like that can ruin your whole group .
ERV	Hebrews	12	16	Be careful that no one commits sexual sin . And be careful that no one is like Esau and never thinks about God . As the oldest son , Esau would have inherited everything from his father . But he sold all that for a single meal .
ERV	Hebrews	12	17	You remember that after Esau did this , he wanted to get his father ’ s blessing . He wanted that blessing so much that he cried . But his father refused to give him the blessing , because Esau could find no way to change what he had done .
ERV	Hebrews	12	18	You have not come to a place that can be seen and touched , like the mountain the people of Israel saw , which was burning with fire and covered with darkness , gloom , and storms .

All of God ’ s children are like that . - Hebrews 12:24 sprinkled blood The blood ( death ) of Jesus . - Hebrews 12:26 Quote from Hag . 2:6 .
ERV	Hebrews	12	20	They did not want to hear the command : “ If anything , even an animal , touches the mountain , it must be killed with stones. ” [ a ]
ERV	Hebrews	12	21	What they saw was so terrible that Moses said , “ I am shaking with fear. ” [ b ] [ c ]
ERV	Hebrews	12	22	But you have come to Mount Zion , to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem . [ d ] You have come to a place where thousands of angels have gathered to celebrate .
ERV	Hebrews	12	23	You have come to the meeting of God ’ s firstborn [ e ] children . Their names are written in heaven . You have come to God , the judge of all people . And you have come to the spirits of good people who have been made perfect .
ERV	Hebrews	12	24	You have come to Jesus—the one who brought the new agreement from God to his people . You have come to the sprinkled blood [ f ] that tells us about better things than the blood of Abel .
ERV	Hebrews	12	25	Be careful and don ’ t refuse to listen when God speaks . Those people refused to listen to him when he warned them on earth . And they did not escape . Now God is speaking from heaven . So now it will be worse for those who refuse to listen to him .
ERV	Hebrews	12	26	When he spoke before , his voice shook the earth . But now he has promised , “ Once again I will shake the earth , but I will also shake heaven. ” [ g ]
ERV	Hebrews	12	27	The words “ once again ” clearly show us that everything that was created will be destroyed—that is , the things that can be shaken . And only what can not be shaken will remain .
ERV	Hebrews	12	28	So we should be thankful because we have a kingdom that can not be shaken . And because we are thankful , we should worship God in a way that will please him . We should do this with respect and fear ,
ERV	Hebrews	12	29	because our God is like a fire that can destroy us . Footnotes - Hebrews 12:20 Quote from Ex . 19:12-13 . - Hebrews 12:21 Quote from Deut . 9:19 . - Hebrews 12:21 These verses refer to things that happened to the people of Israel in the time of Moses as described in Ex .
ERV	Hebrews	13	13	So we should go to Jesus outside the camp and accept the same shame that he had .
ERV	Hebrews	13	2	Always remember to help people by welcoming them into your home . Some people have done that and have helped angels without knowing it .
ERV	Hebrews	13	3	Don ’ t forget those who are in prison . Remember them as though you were in prison with them . And don ’ t forget those who are suffering . Remember them as though you were suffering with them .
ERV	Hebrews	13	4	Marriage should be honored by everyone . And every marriage should be kept pure between husband and wife . God will judge guilty those who commit sexual sins and adultery .
ERV	Hebrews	13	5	Keep your lives free from the love of money . And be satisfied with what you have . God has said , “ I will never leave you ; I will never run away from you. ” ( A )
ERV	Hebrews	13	6	So we can feel sure and say , “ The Lord is my helper ; I will not be afraid . People can do nothing to me. ” ( B )
ERV	Hebrews	13	7	Remember your leaders . They taught God ’ s message to you . Remember how they lived and died , and copy their faith .
ERV	Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday , today , and forever .
ERV	Hebrews	13	9	Don ’ t let all kinds of strange teachings lead you into the wrong way . Depend only on God ’ s grace for spiritual strength , not on rules about foods . Obeying those rules doesn ’ t help anyone .
ERV	Hebrews	13	10	We have a sacrifice . [ a ] And those priests who serve in the Holy Tent can not eat from the sacrifice we have .
ERV	Hebrews	13	11	The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place [ b ] and offers that blood for sins . But the bodies of those animals are burned outside the camp .
ERV	Hebrews	13	12	So Jesus also suffered outside the city . He died to make his people holy with his own blood .
ERV	Hebrews	13	14	Here on earth we don ’ t have a city that lasts forever . But we are waiting for the city that we will have in the future .
ERV	Hebrews	13	15	So through Jesus we should never stop offering our sacrifice to God . That sacrifice is our praise , coming from lips that speak his name .
ERV	Hebrews	13	16	And don ’ t forget to do good and to share what you have with others , because sacrifices like these are very pleasing to God .
ERV	Hebrews	13	17	Obey your leaders . Be willing to do what they say . They are responsible for your spiritual welfare , so they are always watching to protect you . Obey them so that their work will give them joy , not grief . It won ’ t help you to make it hard for them .
ERV	Hebrews	13	18	Continue praying for us . We feel right about what we do , because we always try to do what is best .
ERV	Hebrews	13	19	And I beg you to pray that God will send me back to you soon . I want this more than anything else . 20-21 I pray that the God of peace will give you every good thing you need so that you can do what he wants . God is the one who raised from death our Lord Jesus , the Great Shepherd of his sheep . He raised him because Jesus sacrificed his blood to begin the new agreement that never ends . I pray that God will work through Jesus Christ to do the things in us that please him . To him be glory forever . Amen .
ERV	Hebrews	13	22	My brothers and sisters , I beg you to listen patiently to what I have said . I wrote this letter to strengthen you . And it is not very long .
ERV	Hebrews	13	23	I want you to know that our brother Timothy is out of prison . If he comes to me soon , we will both come to see you .
ERV	Hebrews	13	24	Give my greetings to all your leaders and to all God ’ s people . All those from Italy send you their greetings .
ERV	Hebrews	13	25	God ’ s grace be with you all . Footnotes - Hebrews 13:10 sacrifice Literally , “ altar. ” Here , it means the sacrifice ( offering ) of Jesus . He gave his life to pay for people ’ s sins . - Hebrews 13:11 Most Holy Place Literally , “ the holies , ” the place in the Jewish Tabernacle or Temple where God met the high priest .
ERV	James	1	1	Greetings from James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ . To God ’ s people [ a ] who are scattered all over the world . Faith and Wisdom
ERV	James	1	2	My brothers and sisters , you will have many kinds of trouble . But this gives you a reason to be very happy .
ERV	James	1	3	You know that when your faith is tested , you learn to be patient in suffering .
ERV	James	1	4	If you let that patience work in you , the end result will be good . You will be mature and complete . You will be all that God wants you to be .
ERV	James	1	5	Do any of you need wisdom ? Ask God for it . He is generous and enjoys giving to everyone . So he will give you wisdom .
ERV	James	1	6	But when you ask God , you must believe . Don ’ t doubt him . Whoever doubts is like a wave in the sea that is blown up and down by the wind . 7-8 People like that are thinking two different things at the same time . They can never decide what to do . So they should not think they will receive anything from the Lord . True Riches
ERV	James	1	9	Believers who are poor should be glad that God considers them so important .
ERV	James	1	10	Believers who are rich should be glad when bad things happen that humble them . Their riches won ’ t keep them from disappearing as quickly as wildflowers .
ERV	James	1	11	As the sun rises and gets hotter , its heat dries up the plants , and the flowers fall off . The flowers that were so beautiful are now dead . That ’ s how it is with the rich . While they are still making plans for their business , they will die . Temptation Does Not Come From God
ERV	James	1	12	Great blessings belong to those who are tempted and remain faithful ! After they have proved their faith , God will give them the reward [ b ] of eternal life . God promised this to all people who love him .
ERV	James	1	13	Whenever you feel tempted to do something bad , you should not say , “ God is tempting me. ” Evil can not tempt God , and God himself does not tempt anyone .
ERV	James	1	14	You are tempted by the evil things you want . Your own desire leads you away and traps you .
ERV	James	1	15	Your desire grows inside you until it results in sin . Then the sin grows bigger and bigger and finally ends in death .
ERV	James	1	16	My dear brothers and sisters , don ’ t be fooled about this .
ERV	James	1	17	Everything good comes from God . Every perfect gift is from him . These good gifts come down from the Father who made all the lights in the sky . But God never changes like the shadows from those lights . He is always the same .
ERV	James	1	18	God decided to give us life through the true message he sent to us . He wanted us to be the most important of all that he created . Listening and Obeying
ERV	James	1	19	My dear brothers and sisters , always be more willing to listen than to speak . Keep control of your anger .
ERV	James	1	20	Anger does not help you live the way God wants .
ERV	James	1	21	So get rid of everything evil in your lives—every kind of wrong you do . Be humble and accept God ’ s teaching that is planted in your hearts . This teaching can save you .
ERV	James	1	22	Do what God ’ s teaching says ; don ’ t just listen and do nothing . When you only sit and listen , you are fooling yourselves .
ERV	James	1	23	Hearing God ’ s teaching and doing nothing is like looking at your face in the mirror
ERV	James	1	24	and doing nothing about what you saw . You go away and immediately forget how bad you looked .
ERV	James	1	25	But when you look into God ’ s perfect law that sets people free , pay attention to it . If you do what it says , you will have God ’ s blessing . Never just listen to his teaching and forget what you heard . The True Way to Worship God
ERV	James	1	26	You might think you are a very religious person . But if your tongue is out of control , you are fooling yourself . Your careless talk makes your offerings to God worthless .
ERV	James	1	27	The worship that God wants is this : caring for orphans or widows who need help and keeping yourself free from the world ’ s evil influence . This is the kind of worship that God accepts as pure and good . Footnotes - James 1:1 God ’ s people Literally , “ the twelve tribes. ” Believers in Christ are like the tribes of Israel , God ’ s chosen people in the Old Testament . - James 1:12 reward Literally , “ wreath , ” a ring of leaves or branches that was placed on the head of the winners of athletic contests to honor them . It was a symbol of victory and reward .
ERV	James	2	2	Chron . 20:7 ; Isa . 41:8 . - James 2:25 She helped … road The story about Rahab is found in Josh . 2:1-21 .
ERV	James	2	3	You show special attention to the person wearing nice clothes . You say , “ Sit here in this good seat. ” But you say to the poor person , “ Stand there ! ” or “ Sit on the floor by our feet ! ”
ERV	James	2	4	Doesn ’ t this show that you think some people are more important than others ? You set yourselves up as judges—judges who make bad decisions .
ERV	James	2	5	Listen , my dear brothers and sisters . God chose the poor people in the world to be rich in faith . He chose them to receive the kingdom God promised to those who love him .
ERV	James	2	6	But you show no respect to those who are poor . And you know that the rich are the ones who always try to control your lives . And they are the ones who take you to court .
ERV	James	2	7	And the rich are the ones who insult the wonderful name of Christ , the name by which you are known .
ERV	James	2	8	One law rules over all other laws . This royal law is found in the Scriptures : “ Love your neighbor [ a ] the same as you love yourself. ” [ b ] If you obey this law , you are doing right .
ERV	James	2	9	But if you are treating one person as more important than another , you are sinning . You are guilty of breaking God ’ s law .
ERV	James	2	10	You might follow all of God ’ s law . But if you fail to obey only one command , you are guilty of breaking all the commands in that law .
ERV	James	2	11	God said , “ Don ’ t commit adultery. ” [ c ] The same God also said , “ Don ’ t kill. ” [ d ] So if you don ’ t commit adultery , but you kill someone , you are guilty of breaking all of God ’ s law .
ERV	James	2	12	You will be judged by the law that makes people free . You should remember this in everything you say and do .
ERV	James	2	13	Yes , you must show mercy to others . If you do not show mercy , then God will not show mercy to you when he judges you . But the one who shows mercy can stand without fear before the Judge . Faith and Good Works
ERV	James	2	14	My brothers and sisters , if a person claims to have faith but does nothing , that faith is worth nothing . Faith like that can not save anyone .
ERV	James	2	15	Suppose a brother or sister in Christ comes to you in need of clothes or something to eat .
ERV	James	2	16	And you say to them , “ God be with you ! I hope you stay warm and get plenty to eat , ” but you don ’ t give them the things they need . If you don ’ t help them , your words are worthless .
ERV	James	2	17	It is the same with faith . If it is just faith and nothing more—if it doesn ’ t do anything—it is dead .
ERV	James	2	18	But someone might argue , “ Some people have faith , and others have good works. ” My answer would be that you can ’ t show me your faith if you don ’ t do anything . But I will show you my faith by the good I do .
ERV	James	2	19	You believe there is one God . That ’ s good , but even the demons believe that ! And they shake with fear .
ERV	James	2	20	You fool ! Faith that does nothing is worth nothing . Do you want me to prove this to you ?
ERV	James	2	21	Our father Abraham was made right with God by what he did . He offered his son Isaac to God on the altar .
ERV	James	2	22	So you see that Abraham ’ s faith and what he did worked together . His faith was made perfect by what he did .
ERV	James	2	23	This shows the full meaning of the Scriptures that say , “ Abraham believed God , and because of this faith he was accepted as one who is right with God. ” [ e ] Abraham was called “ God ’ s friend. ” [ f ]
ERV	James	2	24	So you see that people are made right with God by what they do . They can not be made right by faith alone .
ERV	James	2	25	Another example is Rahab . She was a prostitute , but she was made right with God by something she did . She helped those who were spying for God ’ s people . She welcomed them into her home and helped them escape by a different road . [ g ]
ERV	James	2	26	A person ’ s body that does not have a spirit is dead . It is the same with faith—faith that does nothing is dead ! Footnotes - James 2:8 your neighbor Or “ others. ” Jesus ’ teaching in Lk . 10:25-37 makes clear that this includes anyone in need . - James 2:8 Quote from Lev . 19:18 . - James 2:11 Quote from Ex . 20:14 ; Deut . 5:18 . - James 2:11 Quote from Ex . 20:13 ; Deut . 5:17 . - James 2:23 Quote from Gen. 15:6 . - James 2:23 Quote from
ERV	James	3	3	We put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us . With these bits we can control their whole body .
ERV	James	3	2	We all make many mistakes . A person who never said anything wrong would be perfect . Someone like that would be able to control their whole body too .
ERV	James	3	4	It is the same with ships . A ship is very big , and it is pushed by strong winds . But a very small rudder controls that big ship . And the one who controls the rudder decides where the ship will go . It goes where he wants it to go .
ERV	James	3	5	It is the same with our tongue . It is a small part of the body , but it can boast about doing great things . A big forest fire can be started with only a little flame .
ERV	James	3	6	The tongue is like a fire . It is a world of evil among the parts of our body . It spreads its evil through our whole body and starts a fire that influences all of life . It gets this fire from hell .
ERV	James	3	7	Humans have control over every kind of wild animal , bird , reptile , and fish , and they have controlled all these things .
ERV	James	3	8	But no one can control the tongue . It is wild and evil , full of deadly poison .
ERV	James	3	9	We use our tongues to praise our Lord and Father , but then we curse people who were created in God ’ s likeness .
ERV	James	3	10	These praises and curses come from the same mouth . My brothers and sisters , this should not happen .
ERV	James	3	11	Do good water and bad water flow from the same spring ? Of course not .
ERV	James	3	12	My brothers and sisters , can a fig tree make olives ? Or can a grapevine make figs ? No , and a well full of salty water can not give good water . True Wisdom
ERV	James	3	13	Are there any among you who are really wise and understanding ? Then you should show your wisdom by living right . You should do what is good with humility . A wise person does not boast .
ERV	James	3	14	If you are selfish and have bitter jealousy in your hearts , you have no reason to boast . Your boasting is a lie that hides the truth .
ERV	James	3	15	That kind of “ wisdom ” does not come from God . That “ wisdom ” comes from the world . It is not spiritual . It is from the devil .
ERV	James	3	16	Where there is jealousy and selfishness , there will be confusion and every kind of evil .
ERV	James	3	17	But the wisdom that comes from God is like this : First , it is pure . It is also peaceful , gentle , and easy to please . This wisdom is always ready to help people who have trouble and to do good for others . This wisdom is always fair and honest .
ERV	James	3	18	People who work for peace in a peaceful way get the blessings that come from right living .
ERV	James	4	4	You people are not faithful to God ! You should know that loving what the world has is the same as hating God . So anyone who wants to be friends with this evil world becomes God ’ s enemy .
ERV	James	4	2	You want things , but you don ’ t get them . So you kill and are jealous of others . But you still can not get what you want . So you argue and fight . You don ’ t get what you want because you don ’ t ask God .
ERV	James	4	3	Or when you ask , you don ’ t receive anything , because the reason you ask is wrong . You only want to use it for your own pleasure .
ERV	James	4	5	Do you think the Scriptures mean nothing ? The Scriptures say , “ The Spirit God made to live in us wants us only for himself. ” [ a ]
ERV	James	4	6	But the kindness God shows is greater . As the Scripture says , “ God is against the proud , but he is kind to the humble. ” [ b ]
ERV	James	4	7	So give yourselves to God . Stand against the devil , and he will run away from you .
ERV	James	4	8	Come near to God and he will come near to you . You are sinners , so clean sin out of your lives . [ c ] You are trying to follow God and the world at the same time . Make your thinking pure .
ERV	James	4	9	Be sad , be sorry , and cry ! Change your laughter into crying . Change your joy into sadness .
ERV	James	4	10	Be humble before the Lord , and he will make you great . You Are Not the Judge
ERV	James	4	11	Brothers and sisters , don ’ t say anything against each other . If you criticize your brother or sister in Christ or judge them , you are criticizing and judging the law they follow . And when you are judging the law , you are not a follower of the law . You have become a judge .
ERV	James	4	12	God is the one who gave us the law , and he is the Judge . He is the only one who can save and destroy . So it is not right for you to judge anyone . Let God Plan Your Life
ERV	James	4	13	Some of you say , “ Today or tomorrow we will go to some city . We will stay there a year , do business , and make money. ” Listen , think about this :
ERV	James	4	14	You don ’ t know what will happen tomorrow . Your life is like a fog . You can see it for a short time , but then it goes away .
ERV	James	4	15	So you should say , “ If the Lord wants , we will live and do this or that. ”
ERV	James	4	16	But now you are proud and boast about yourself . All such boasting is wrong .
ERV	James	4	17	If you fail to do what you know is right , you are sinning . Footnotes - James 4:5 “ The Spirit … himself ” Other possible translations : “ God strongly desires the spirit that he made to live in us. ” Or “ The spirit that he made to live in us is full of envious desires. ” See Ex . 20:5 . - James 4:6 Quote from Prov . 3:34 . - James 4:8 so clean sin out of your lives Literally , “ so wash your hands . ”
ERV	James	5	5	Your life on earth was full of rich living . You pleased yourselves with everything you wanted . You made yourselves fat , like an animal ready for the day of slaughter . [ a ]
ERV	James	5	2	Your riches will rot and be worth nothing . Your clothes will be eaten by moths .
ERV	James	5	3	Your gold and silver will rust , and that rust will be a proof that you were wrong . That rust will eat your bodies like fire . You saved your treasure in the last days .
ERV	James	5	4	People worked in your fields , but you did not pay them . They are crying out against you . They harvested your crops . Now the Lord All-Powerful has heard their cries .
ERV	James	5	6	You showed no mercy to good people . They were not against you , but you killed them . Be Patient
ERV	James	5	7	Brothers and sisters , be patient ; the Lord will come . So be patient until that time . Look at the farmers . They have to be patient . They have to wait for their valuable crop to grow and produce a harvest . They wait patiently for the first rain and the last rain . [ b ]
ERV	James	5	8	You must be patient too . Never stop hoping . The Lord is coming soon .
ERV	James	5	9	Brothers and sisters , don ’ t complain against each other . If you don ’ t stop complaining , you will be judged guilty . And the Judge is ready to come !
ERV	James	5	10	Brothers and sisters , follow the example of the prophets who spoke for the Lord . They suffered many bad things , but they were patient .
ERV	James	5	11	And we say that those who accepted their troubles with patience now have God ’ s blessing . You have heard about Job ’ s patience . [ c ] You know that after all his troubles , the Lord helped him . This shows that the Lord is full of mercy and is kind . Be Careful What You Say
ERV	James	5	12	My brothers and sisters , it is very important that you not use an oath when you make a promise . Don ’ t use the name of heaven , earth , or anything else to prove what you say . When you mean yes , say only “ yes. ” When you mean no , say only “ no. ” Do this so that you will not be judged guilty . The Power of Prayer
ERV	James	5	13	Are you having troubles ? You should pray . Are you happy ? You should sing .
ERV	James	5	14	Are you sick ? Ask the elders of the church to come and rub oil on you [ d ] in the name of the Lord and pray for you .
ERV	James	5	15	If such a prayer is offered in faith , it will heal anyone who is sick . The Lord will heal them . And if they have sinned , he will forgive them .
ERV	James	5	16	So always tell each other the wrong things you have done . Then pray for each other . Do this so that God can heal you . Anyone who lives the way God wants can pray , and great things will happen .
ERV	James	5	17	Elijah was a person just like us . He prayed that it would not rain . And it did not rain on the land for three and a half years !
ERV	James	5	18	Then Elijah prayed that it would rain . And the rain came down from the sky , and the land grew crops again . Helping People When They Sin
ERV	James	5	19	My brothers and sisters , if anyone wanders away from the truth and someone helps that person come back ,
ERV	James	5	20	remember this : Anyone who brings a sinner back from the wrong way will save that person from eternal death and cause many sins to be forgiven .

ERV	1%20Peter	1	1	Peter 1:16 Quote from Lev . 11:44 ,
ERV	1%20Peter	1	2	God planned long ago to choose you and to make you his holy people , which is the Spirit ’ s work . God wanted you to obey him and to be made clean by the blood sacrifice [ a ] of Jesus Christ . I pray that you will enjoy more and more of God ’ s grace and peace . A Living Hope
ERV	1%20Peter	1	3	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . God has great mercy , and because of his mercy he gave us a new life . This new life brings us a living hope through Jesus Christ ’ s resurrection from death .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	4	Now we wait to receive the blessings God has for his children . These blessings are kept for you in heaven . They can not be ruined or be destroyed or lose their beauty .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	5	God ’ s power protects you through your faith , and it keeps you safe until your salvation comes . That salvation is ready to be given to you at the end of time .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	6	I know the thought of that is exciting , even if you must suffer through different kinds of troubles for a short time now .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	7	These troubles test your faith and prove that it is pure . And such faith is worth more than gold . Gold can be proved to be pure by fire , but gold will ruin . When your faith is proven to be pure , the result will be praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ comes .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	8	You have not seen Christ , but still you love him . You can ’ t see him now , but you believe in him . You are filled with a wonderful and heavenly joy that can not be explained .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	9	Your faith has a goal , and you are reaching that goal—your salvation .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	10	The prophets studied carefully and tried to learn about this salvation . They spoke about the grace that was coming to you .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	11	The Spirit of Christ was in those prophets . And the Spirit was telling about the sufferings that would happen to Christ and about the glory that would come after those sufferings . The prophets tried to learn about what the Spirit was showing them—when it would happen and what the world would be like at that time .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	12	It was made clear to them that their service was not for themselves . They were serving you when they told about the things you have now heard . You heard them from those who told you the Good News with the help of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven . Even the angels would like very much to know more about these things you were told . A Call to Holy Living
ERV	1%20Peter	1	13	So prepare your minds for service . With complete self-control put all your hope in the grace that will be yours when Jesus Christ comes .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	14	In the past you did not have the understanding you have now , so you did the evil things you wanted to do . But now you are children of God , so you should obey him and not live the way you did before .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	15	Be holy in everything you do , just as God is holy . He is the one who chose you .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	16	In the Scriptures God says , “ Be holy , because I am holy. ” [ b ]
ERV	1%20Peter	1	17	You pray to God and call him Father , but he will judge everyone the same way—by what they do . So while you are visiting here on earth , you should live with respect for God .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	18	You know that in the past the way you were living was useless . It was a way of life you learned from those who lived before you . But you were saved from that way of living . You were bought , but not with things that ruin like gold or silver .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	19	You were bought with the precious blood of Christ ’ s death . He was a pure and perfect sacrificial Lamb .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	20	Christ was chosen before the world was made , but he was shown to the world in these last times for you .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	21	You believe in God through Christ . God is the one who raised him from death and gave honor to him . So your faith and your hope are in God .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	22	You have made yourselves pure by obeying the truth . Now you can have true love for your brothers and sisters . So love each other deeply—with all your heart .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	23	You have been born again . This new life did not come from something that dies . It came from something that can not die . You were born again through God ’ s life-giving message that lasts forever .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	24	The Scriptures say , “ Our lives are like the grass of spring , and any glory we enjoy is like the beauty of a wildflower . The grass dries up and dies , and the flower falls to the ground .
ERV	1%20Peter	1	25	But the word of the Lord lasts forever. ” ( A ) And that word is the Good News that was told to you . Footnotes -

ERV	1%20Peter	2	2	Like newborn babies hungry for milk , you should want the pure teaching that feeds your spirit . With it you can grow up and be saved .
ERV	1%20Peter	2	3	You have already tasted the goodness of the Lord .
ERV	1%20Peter	2	4	The Lord Jesus is the living stone . [ a ] The people of the world decided that they did not want this stone . But he is the one God chose as one of great value . So come to him .
ERV	1%20Peter	2	5	You also are like living stones , and God is using you to build a spiritual house . [ b ] You are to serve God in this house as holy priests , offering him spiritual sacrifices that he will accept because of Jesus Christ .
ERV	1%20Peter	2	6	The Scriptures say , “ Look , I have chosen a cornerstone of great value , and I put that stone in Zion . Anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed. ” ( A )
ERV	1%20Peter	2	7	So , that stone brings honor for you who believe . But for those who don ’ t believe he is “ the stone that the builders refused to accept , which became the most important stone. ” ( B )
ERV	1%20Peter	2	8	For them he is also “ a stone that makes people stumble , a rock that makes people fall. ” ( C ) People stumble because they don ’ t obey what God says . This is what God planned to happen to those people .
ERV	1%20Peter	2	9	But you are his chosen people , the King ’ s priests . You are a holy nation , people who belong to God . He chose you to tell about the wonderful things he has done . He brought you out of the darkness of sin into his wonderful light .
ERV	1%20Peter	2	10	In the past you were not a special people , but now you are God ’ s people . Once you had not received mercy , but now God has given you his mercy . [ c ] Live for God
ERV	1%20Peter	2	11	Dear friends , you are like visitors and strangers in this world . So I beg you to keep your lives free from the evil things you want to do , those desires that fight against your true selves .
ERV	1%20Peter	2	12	People who don ’ t believe are living all around you . They may say that you are doing wrong . So live such good lives that they will see the good you do , and they will give glory to God on the day he comes . Obey Every Human Authority
ERV	1%20Peter	2	13	Be willing to serve the people who have authority [ d ] in this world . Do this for the Lord . Obey the king , the highest authority .
ERV	1%20Peter	2	14	And obey the leaders who are sent by the king . They are sent to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do good .
ERV	1%20Peter	2	15	When you do good , you stop ignorant people from saying foolish things about you . This is what God wants .
ERV	1%20Peter	2	16	Live like free people , but don ’ t use your freedom as an excuse to do evil . Live as those who are serving God .
ERV	1%20Peter	2	17	Show respect for all people . Love your brothers and sisters in God ’ s family . Respect God , and honor the king . The Example of Christ ’ s Suffering
ERV	1%20Peter	2	18	Slaves , be willing to serve your masters . Do this with all respect . You should obey the masters who are good and kind , and you should obey the masters who are bad .
ERV	1%20Peter	2	19	One of you might have to suffer even when you have done nothing wrong . If you think of God and bear the pain , this pleases God .
ERV	1%20Peter	2	20	But if you are punished for doing wrong , there is no reason to praise you for bearing that punishment . But if you suffer for doing good and you are patient , this pleases God .
ERV	1%20Peter	2	21	This is what you were chosen to do . Christ gave you an example to follow . He suffered for you . So you should do the same as he did :
ERV	1%20Peter	2	22	“ He never sinned , and he never told a lie. ” ( D )
ERV	1%20Peter	2	23	People insulted him , but he did not insult them back . He suffered , but he did not threaten anyone . No , he let God take care of him . God is the one who judges rightly .
ERV	1%20Peter	2	24	Christ carried our sins in his body on the cross . He did this so that we would stop living for sin and live for what is right . By his wounds you were healed .
ERV	1%20Peter	2	25	You were like sheep that went the wrong way . But now you have come back to the Shepherd and Protector of your lives . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Peter	3	1	Peter 3:18 by the Spirit Or “ in the spirit. ” Also in verse
ERV	1%20Peter	3	3	It is not fancy hair , gold jewelry , or fine clothes that should make you beautiful .
ERV	1%20Peter	3	2	Your husbands will see the pure lives that you live with respect for God .
ERV	1%20Peter	3	4	No , your beauty should come from inside you—the beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit . That beauty will never disappear . It is worth very much to God .
ERV	1%20Peter	3	5	It was the same with the holy women who lived long ago and followed God . They made themselves beautiful in that same way . They were willing to serve their husbands .
ERV	1%20Peter	3	6	I am talking about women like Sarah . She obeyed Abraham , her husband , and called him her master . And you women are true children of Sarah if you always do what is right and are not afraid .
ERV	1%20Peter	3	7	In the same way , you husbands should live with your wives in an understanding way , since they are weaker than you . You should show them respect , because God gives them the same blessing he gives you—the grace of true life . Do this so that nothing will stop your prayers from being heard . Suffering for Doing Right
ERV	1%20Peter	3	8	So all of you should live together in peace . Try to understand each other . Love each other like brothers and sisters . Be kind and humble .
ERV	1%20Peter	3	9	Don ’ t do wrong to anyone to pay them back for doing wrong to you . Or don ’ t insult anyone to pay them back for insulting you . But ask God to bless them . Do this because you yourselves were chosen to receive a blessing .
ERV	1%20Peter	3	10	The Scriptures say , “ If you want to enjoy true life and have only good days , then avoid saying anything hurtful , and never let a lie come out of your mouth .
ERV	1%20Peter	3	11	Stop doing what is wrong , and do good . Look for peace , and do all you can to help people live peacefully .
ERV	1%20Peter	3	12	The Lord watches over those who do what is right , and he listens to their prayers . But he is against those who do evil. ” ( A )
ERV	1%20Peter	3	13	If you are always trying to do good , no one can really harm you .
ERV	1%20Peter	3	14	But you may suffer for doing right . If that happens , you have God ’ s blessing . “ Don ’ t be afraid of the people who make you suffer ; don ’ t be worried. ” [ a ]
ERV	1%20Peter	3	15	But keep the Lord Christ holy in your hearts . Always be ready to answer everyone who asks you to explain about the hope you have .
ERV	1%20Peter	3	16	But answer them in a gentle way with respect . Keep your conscience clear . Then people will see the good way you live as followers of Christ , and those who say bad things about you will be ashamed of what they said .
ERV	1%20Peter	3	17	It is better to suffer for doing good than for doing wrong . Yes , it is better if that is what God wants .
ERV	1%20Peter	3	18	Christ himself suffered when he died for you , and with that one death he paid for your sins . He was not guilty , but he died for people who are guilty . He did this to bring all of you to God . In his physical form he was killed , but he was made alive by the Spirit . [ b ]
ERV	1%20Peter	3	19	.
ERV	1%20Peter	3	20	Those were the spirits who refused to obey God long ago in the time of Noah . God was waiting patiently for people while Noah was building the big boat . And only a few—eight in all—were saved in the boat through the floodwater .
ERV	1%20Peter	3	21	And that water is like baptism , which now saves you . Baptism is not the washing of dirt from the body . It is asking God for a clean conscience . It saves you because Jesus Christ was raised from death .
ERV	1%20Peter	3	22	Now he has gone into heaven . He is at God ’ s right side and rules over angels , authorities , and powers . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Peter	4	1	Peter 4:6 through the Spirit Or “ in the spirit , ” meaning in the spiritual or heavenly realm .
ERV	1%20Peter	4	4	Now those “ friends ” think it is strange that you no longer join them in all the wild and wasteful things they do . And so they say bad things about you .
ERV	1%20Peter	4	2	Strengthen yourselves so that you will live your lives here on earth doing what God wants , not the evil things that people want to do .
ERV	1%20Peter	4	3	In the past you wasted too much time doing what those who don ’ t know God like to do . You were living immoral lives , doing the evil things you wanted to do . You were always getting drunk , having wild drinking parties , and doing shameful things in your worship of idols .
ERV	1%20Peter	4	5	But they will have to face God to explain what they have done . He is the one who will soon judge everyone—those who are still living and those who have died .
ERV	1%20Peter	4	6	Some were told the Good News before they died . They were criticized by others in their life here on earth . But it was God ’ s plan that they hear the Good News so that they could have a new life through the Spirit . [ a ] Be Good Managers of God ’ s Gifts
ERV	1%20Peter	4	7	The time is near when all things will end . So keep your minds clear , and control yourselves . This will help you in your prayers .
ERV	1%20Peter	4	8	Most important of all , love each other deeply , because love makes you willing to forgive many sins .
ERV	1%20Peter	4	9	Open your homes to each other and share your food without complaining .
ERV	1%20Peter	4	10	God has shown you his grace in many different ways . So be good servants and use whatever gift he has given you in a way that will best serve each other .
ERV	1%20Peter	4	11	If your gift is speaking , your words should be like words from God . If your gift is serving , you should serve with the strength that God gives . Then it is God who will be praised in everything through Jesus Christ . Power and glory belong to him forever and ever . Amen . Suffering as a Follower of Christ
ERV	1%20Peter	4	12	My friends , don ’ t be surprised at the painful things that you are now suffering , which are testing your faith . Don ’ t think that something strange is happening to you .
ERV	1%20Peter	4	13	But you should be happy that you are sharing in Christ ’ s sufferings . You will be happy and full of joy when Christ shows his glory .
ERV	1%20Peter	4	14	When people say bad things to you because you follow Christ , consider it a blessing . When that happens , it shows that God ’ s Spirit , the Spirit of glory , is with you .
ERV	1%20Peter	4	15	You may suffer , but don ’ t let it be because you murder , steal , make trouble , or try to control other people ’ s lives .
ERV	1%20Peter	4	16	But if you suffer because you are a “ Christ-follower , ” don ’ t be ashamed . You should praise God for that name .
ERV	1%20Peter	4	17	It is time for judging to begin . That judging will begin with God ’ s family . If it begins with us , then what will happen to those who don ’ t accept the Good News of God ?
ERV	1%20Peter	4	18	“ If it is hard for even a good person to be saved , what will happen to the one who is against God and full of sin ? ” ( A )
ERV	1%20Peter	4	19	So if God wants you to suffer , you should trust your lives to him . He is the one who made you , and you can trust him . So continue to do good . Footnotes -

ERV	1%20Peter	5	5	Young people , I have something to say to you too . You should accept the authority of the elders . You should all have a humble attitude in dealing with each other . “ God is against the proud , but he is kind to the humble. ” ( A )
ERV	1%20Peter	5	2	take care of the group of people you are responsible for . They are God ’ s flock . [ a ] Watch over that flock because you want to , not because you are forced to do it . That is how God wants it . Do it because you are happy to serve , not because you want money .
ERV	1%20Peter	5	3	Don ’ t be like a ruler over those you are responsible for . But be good examples to them .
ERV	1%20Peter	5	4	Then when Christ the Ruling Shepherd comes , you will get a crown—one that will be glorious and never lose its beauty .
ERV	1%20Peter	5	6	So be humble under God ’ s powerful hand . Then he will lift you up when the right time comes .
ERV	1%20Peter	5	7	Give all your worries to him , because he cares for you .
ERV	1%20Peter	5	8	Control yourselves and be careful ! The devil is your enemy , and he goes around like a roaring lion looking for someone to attack and eat .
ERV	1%20Peter	5	9	Refuse to follow the devil . Stand strong in your faith . You know that your brothers and sisters all over the world are having the same sufferings that you have .
ERV	1%20Peter	5	10	Yes , you will suffer for a short time . But after that , God will make everything right . He will make you strong . He will support you and keep you from falling . He is the God who gives all grace . He chose you to share in his glory in Christ . That glory will continue forever .
ERV	1%20Peter	5	11	All power is his forever . Amen . Final Greetings
ERV	1%20Peter	5	12	Silas will bring this letter to you . I know that he is a faithful brother in Christ . I wrote this short letter to encourage you . I wanted to tell you that this is the true grace of God . Stand strong in that grace .
ERV	1%20Peter	5	13	The church in Babylon [ b ] sends you greetings . They were chosen just as you were . Mark , my son in Christ , also sends his greetings .

ERV	2%20Peter	1	2	Peter 1:18 This event is described in the Gospels . See Mt . 17:1-8 ; Mk . 9:2-8 ; Lk . 9:28-36 .
ERV	2%20Peter	1	1	Greetings from Simon Peter , a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ . To all of you who share in the same valuable faith that we have . This faith was given to us because our God and Savior Jesus Christ always does what is good and right .
ERV	2%20Peter	1	3	Jesus has the power of God . And his power has given us everything we need to live a life devoted to God . We have these things because we know him . Jesus chose us by his glory and goodness ,
ERV	2%20Peter	1	4	through which he also gave us the very great and rich gifts that he promised us . With these gifts you can share in being like God . And so you will escape the ruin that comes to people in the world because of the evil things they want .
ERV	2%20Peter	1	5	Because you have these blessings , do all you can to add to your life these things : to your faith add goodness ; to your goodness add knowledge ;
ERV	2%20Peter	1	6	to your knowledge add self-control ; to your self-control add patience ; to your patience add devotion to God ;
ERV	2%20Peter	1	7	to your devotion add kindness toward your brothers and sisters in Christ , and to this kindness add love .
ERV	2%20Peter	1	8	If all these things are in you and growing , you will never fail to be useful to God . You will produce the kind of fruit that should come from your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
ERV	2%20Peter	1	9	But those who don ’ t grow in these blessings are blind . They can not see clearly what they have . They have forgotten that they were cleansed from their past sins .
ERV	2%20Peter	1	10	My brothers and sisters , God called you and chose you to be his . Do your best to live in a way that shows you really are God ’ s called and chosen people . If you do all this , you will never fall .
ERV	2%20Peter	1	11	And you will be given a very great welcome into the kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , a kingdom that never ends .
ERV	2%20Peter	1	12	You already know these things . You are very strong in the truth you have . But I am always going to help you remember them .
ERV	2%20Peter	1	13	While I am still living here on earth , I think it is right for me to remind you of them .
ERV	2%20Peter	1	14	I know that I must soon leave this body . Our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me that .
ERV	2%20Peter	1	15	I will try my best to make sure you remember these things even after I am gone . We Saw Christ ’ s Glory
ERV	2%20Peter	1	16	We told you about the power of our Lord Jesus Christ . We told you about his coming . The things we told you were not just clever stories that people invented . No , we saw the greatness of Jesus with our own eyes .
ERV	2%20Peter	1	17	Jesus heard the voice of the great and glorious God . That was when he received honor and glory from God the Father . The voice said , “ This is my Son , the one I love . I am very pleased with him. ”
ERV	2%20Peter	1	18	And we heard that voice . It came from heaven while we were with Jesus on the holy mountain . [ a ]
ERV	2%20Peter	1	19	This makes us more sure about what the prophets said . And it is good for you to follow closely what they said , which is like a light shining in a dark place . You have that light until the day begins and the morning star brings new light to your minds .
ERV	2%20Peter	1	20	Most important of all , you must understand this : No prophecy in the Scriptures comes from the prophet ’ s own understanding .
ERV	2%20Peter	1	21	No prophecy ever came from what some person wanted to say . But people were led by the Holy Spirit and spoke words from God . Footnotes -
ERV	2%20Peter	2	2	Peter 2:22 Quote from Prov . 26:11 .
ERV	2%20Peter	2	3	These false teachers only want your money . So they will use you by telling you things that are not true . But the judgment against these false teachers has been ready for a long time . And they will not escape God who will destroy them .
ERV	2%20Peter	2	4	When angels sinned , God did not let them go free without punishment . He sent them to hell . He put those angels in caves of darkness , where they are being held until the time when God will judge them .
ERV	2%20Peter	2	5	And God punished the evil people who lived long ago . He brought a flood to the world that was full of people who were against God . But he saved Noah and seven other people with him . Noah was a man who told people about living right .
ERV	2%20Peter	2	6	God also punished the evil cities of Sodom and Gomorrah . He burned them until there was nothing left but ashes . He used those cities as an example of what will happen to people who are against God .
ERV	2%20Peter	2	7	But he saved Lot , a good man who lived there . Lot was greatly troubled by the morally bad lives of those evil people .
ERV	2%20Peter	2	8	This good man lived with those evil people every day , and his good heart was hurt by the evil things he saw and heard .
ERV	2%20Peter	2	9	So you see that the Lord God knows how to save those who are devoted to him . He will save them when troubles come . And the Lord will hold evil people to punish them on the day of judgment .
ERV	2%20Peter	2	10	That punishment is for those who are always doing the evil that their sinful selves want to do . It is for those who hate the Lord ’ s authority . These false teachers do whatever they want , and they are so proud of themselves . They are not afraid even to say bad things against the glorious ones . [ a ]
ERV	2%20Peter	2	11	The angels are much stronger and more powerful than these beings . But even the angels don ’ t accuse them and say bad things about them to the Lord .
ERV	2%20Peter	2	12	But these false teachers speak evil against what they don ’ t understand . They are like animals that do things without really thinking—like wild animals that are born to be caught and killed . And , like wild animals , they will be destroyed .
ERV	2%20Peter	2	13	They have made many people suffer . So they themselves will suffer . That is their pay for what they have done . They think it is fun to do evil where everyone can see them . They enjoy the evil things that please them . So they are like dirty spots and stains among you—they bring shame to you in the meals you eat together .
ERV	2%20Peter	2	14	Every time they look at a woman , they want her . They are always sinning this way . And they lead weaker people into the trap of sin . They have taught themselves well to be greedy . They are under a curse . [ b ]
ERV	2%20Peter	2	15	These false teachers left the right way and went the wrong way . They followed the same way that the prophet Balaam went . He was the son of Beor , who loved being paid for doing wrong .
ERV	2%20Peter	2	16	But a donkey told him that he was doing wrong . A donkey can not talk , of course , but that donkey spoke with a man ’ s voice and stopped the prophet from acting so crazy .
ERV	2%20Peter	2	17	These false teachers are like springs that have no water . They are like clouds that are blown by a storm . A place in the deepest darkness has been kept for them .
ERV	2%20Peter	2	18	They boast with words that mean nothing . They lead people into the trap of sin . They find people who have just escaped from a wrong way of life and lead them back into sin . They do this by using the evil things people want to do in their human weakness .
ERV	2%20Peter	2	19	These false teachers promise those people freedom , but they themselves are not free . They are slaves to a mind that has been ruined by sin . Yes , people are slaves to anything that controls them .
ERV	2%20Peter	2	20	People can be made free from the evil in the world . They can be made free by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . But if they go back into those evil things and are controlled by them , then it is worse for them than it was before .
ERV	2%20Peter	2	21	Yes , it would be better for them to have never known the right way . That would be better than to know the right way and then to turn away from the holy teaching that was given to them .
ERV	2%20Peter	2	22	What they did is like these true sayings : “ A dog vomits and goes back to what it threw up. ” [ c ] And , “ After a pig is washed , it goes back and rolls in the mud again. ” Footnotes -

ERV	2%20Peter	3	3	It is important for you to understand what will happen in the last days . People will laugh at you . They will live following the evil they want to do .
ERV	2%20Peter	3	4	They will say , “ Jesus promised to come again . Where is he ? Our fathers have died , but the world continues the way it has been since it was made. ”
ERV	2%20Peter	3	5	But these people don ’ t want to remember what happened long ago . The skies were there , and God made the earth from water and with water . All this happened by God ’ s word .
ERV	2%20Peter	3	6	Then the world was flooded and destroyed with water .
ERV	2%20Peter	3	7	And that same word of God is keeping the skies and the earth that we have now . They are being kept to be destroyed by fire . They are kept for the day of judgment and the destruction of all people who are against God .
ERV	2%20Peter	3	8	But don ’ t forget this one thing , dear friends : To the Lord a day is like a thousand years , and a thousand years is like a day .
ERV	2%20Peter	3	9	The Lord is not being slow in doing what he promised—the way some people understand slowness . But God is being patient with you . He doesn ’ t want anyone to be lost . He wants everyone to change their ways and stop sinning .
ERV	2%20Peter	3	10	But the day when the Lord comes again will surprise everyone like the coming of a thief . The sky will disappear with a loud noise . Everything in the sky will be destroyed with fire . And the earth and everything in it will be burned up . [ a ]
ERV	2%20Peter	3	11	Everything will be destroyed in this way . So what kind of people should you be ? Your lives should be holy and devoted to God .
ERV	2%20Peter	3	12	You should be looking forward to the day of God , wanting more than anything else for it to come soon . When it comes , the sky will be destroyed with fire , and everything in the sky will melt with heat .
ERV	2%20Peter	3	13	But God made a promise to us . And we are waiting for what he promised—a new sky and a new earth . That will be the place where goodness lives .
ERV	2%20Peter	3	14	Dear friends , we are waiting for this to happen . So try as hard as you can to be without sin and without fault . Try to be at peace with God .
ERV	2%20Peter	3	15	Remember that we are saved because our Lord is patient . Our dear brother Paul told you that same thing when he wrote to you with the wisdom that God gave him .
ERV	2%20Peter	3	16	That ’ s what he says in all his letters when he writes about these things . There are parts of his letters that are hard to understand , and some people give a wrong meaning to them . These people are ignorant and weak in faith . They also give wrong meanings to the other Scriptures . But they are destroying themselves by doing that .
ERV	2%20Peter	3	17	Dear friends , you already know about this . So be careful . Don ’ t let these evil people lead you away by the wrong they do . Be careful that you do not fall from your strong faith .

ERV	1%20John	2	8	But what I write is also a new command . It is a true one ; you can see its truth in Jesus and in yourselves . The darkness is passing away , and the true light is already shining .
ERV	1%20John	2	9	Someone might say , “ I am in the light , ” but if they hate any of their brothers or sisters in God ’ s family , they are still in the darkness .

ERV	1%20John	2	19	These enemies were in our group , but they left us . They did not really belong with us . If they were really part of our group , they would have stayed with us . But they left . This shows that none of them really belonged with us .

ERV	1%20John	3	7	Dear children , don ’ t let anyone lead you into the wrong way . Christ always did what was right . So to be good like Christ , you must do what is right .
ERV	1%20John	3	8	The devil has been sinning since the beginning . Anyone who continues to sin belongs to the devil . The Son of God came for this : to destroy the devil ’ s work .
ERV	1%20John	3	9	Those who are God ’ s children do not continue to sin , because the new life God gave them [ a ] stays in them . They can not keep sinning , because they have become children of God .
ERV	1%20John	3	10	So we can see who God ’ s children are and who the devil ’ s children are . These are the ones who are not God ’ s children : those who don ’ t do what is right and those who do not love their brothers and sisters in God ’ s family . We Must Love One Another
ERV	1%20John	3	11	This is the teaching you have heard from the beginning : We must love each other .

ERV	1%20John	3	15	Anyone who hates a fellow believer is a murderer . [ b ] And you know that no murderer has eternal life .
ERV	1%20John	3	16	This is how we know what real love is : Jesus gave his life for us . So we should give our lives for each other as brothers and sisters .
ERV	1%20John	3	17	Suppose a believer who is rich enough to have all the necessities of life sees a fellow believer who is poor and does not have even basic needs . What if the rich believer does not help the poor one ? Then it is clear that God ’ s love is not in that person ’ s heart .
ERV	1%20John	3	18	My children , our love should not be only words and talk . No , our love must be real . We must show our love by the things we do . 19-20 That ’ s how we know we belong to the way of truth . And when our hearts make us feel guilty , we can still have peace before God , because God is greater than our hearts . He knows everything .
ERV	1%20John	3	21	My dear friends , if we don ’ t feel that we are doing wrong , we can be without fear when we come to God .
ERV	1%20John	3	22	And God gives us what we ask for . We receive it because we obey God ’ s commands and do what pleases him .
ERV	1%20John	3	23	This is what God commands : that we believe in his Son Jesus Christ , and that we love each other as he commanded .
ERV	1%20John	3	24	All who obey God ’ s commands live in God . And God lives in them . How do we know that God lives in us ? We know because of the Spirit he gave us . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20John	4	1	John 4:17 Jesus Literally , “ that one . ”
ERV	1%20John	4	4	My dear children , you belong to God , so you have already defeated these false prophets . That ’ s because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world .
ERV	1%20John	4	2	This is how you can recognize God ’ s Spirit . One spirit says , “ I believe that Jesus is the Messiah who came to earth and became a man. ” That Spirit is from God .
ERV	1%20John	4	3	Another spirit refuses to say this about Jesus . That spirit is not from God . This is the spirit of the enemy of Christ . You have heard that the enemy of Christ is coming , and now he is already in the world .
ERV	1%20John	4	5	And they belong to the world , so what they say is from the world too . And the world listens to what they say .
ERV	1%20John	4	6	But we are from God . So the people who know God listen to us . But the people who are not from God don ’ t listen to us . This is how we know the Spirit that is true and the spirit that is false . Love Comes From God
ERV	1%20John	4	7	Dear friends , we should love each other , because love comes from God . Everyone who loves has become God ’ s child . And so everyone who loves knows God .
ERV	1%20John	4	8	Anyone who does not love does not know God , because God is love .
ERV	1%20John	4	9	This is how God showed his love to us : He sent his only Son into the world to give us life through him .
ERV	1%20John	4	10	True love is God ’ s love for us , not our love for God . He sent his Son as the way to take away our sins .
ERV	1%20John	4	11	That is how much God loved us , dear friends ! So we also must love each other .
ERV	1%20John	4	12	No one has ever seen God . But if we love each other , God lives in us . If we love each other , God ’ s love has reached its goal—it is made perfect in us .
ERV	1%20John	4	13	We know that we live in God and God lives in us . We know this because he gave us his Spirit .
ERV	1%20John	4	14	We have seen that the Father sent his Son to be the Savior of the world , and this is what we tell people now .
ERV	1%20John	4	15	Anyone who says , “ I believe that Jesus is the Son of God , ” is a person who lives in God , and God lives in that person .
ERV	1%20John	4	16	So we know the love that God has for us , and we trust that love . God is love . Everyone who lives in love lives in God , and God lives in them .
ERV	1%20John	4	17	If God ’ s love is made perfect in us , we can be without fear on the day when God judges the world . We will be without fear , because in this world we are like Jesus . [ a ]
ERV	1%20John	4	18	Where God ’ s love is , there is no fear , because God ’ s perfect love takes away fear . It is his punishment that makes a person fear . So his love is not made perfect in the one who has fear .
ERV	1%20John	4	19	We love because God first loved us .
ERV	1%20John	4	20	If we say we love God but hate any of our brothers or sisters in his family , we are liars . If we don ’ t love someone we have seen , how can we love God ? We have never even seen him .
ERV	1%20John	4	21	God gave us this command : If we love God , we must also love each other as brothers and sisters . Footnotes -

ERV	1%20John	5	5	It is our faith that has won the victory against the world . So who wins against the world ? Only those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God . God Told Us About His Son
ERV	1%20John	5	2	How do we know that we love God ’ s children ? We know because we love God and we obey his commands .
ERV	1%20John	5	3	Loving God means obeying his commands . And God ’ s commands are not too hard for us ,
ERV	1%20John	5	4	because everyone who is a child of God has the power to win against the world .
ERV	1%20John	5	6	Jesus Christ is the one who came . He came with water and with blood . [ a ] He did not come by water only . No , Jesus came by both water and blood . And the Spirit tells us that this is true . The Spirit is the truth .
ERV	1%20John	5	7	So there are three witnesses that tell us about Jesus :
ERV	1%20John	5	8	the Spirit , the water , and the blood . These three witnesses agree .
ERV	1%20John	5	9	We believe people when they say something is true . But what God says is more important . And this is what God told us : He told us the truth about his own Son .
ERV	1%20John	5	10	Whoever believes in the Son of God has the truth that God told us . But people who do not believe God make God a liar , because they do not believe what God told us about his Son .
ERV	1%20John	5	11	This is what God told us : God has given us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
ERV	1%20John	5	12	Whoever has the Son has life , but whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life . We Have Eternal Life Now
ERV	1%20John	5	13	I write this letter to you who believe in the Son of God . I write so that you will know that you have eternal life now .
ERV	1%20John	5	14	We can come to God with no doubts . This means that when we ask God for things ( and those things agree with what God wants for us ) , God cares about what we say .
ERV	1%20John	5	15	He listens to us every time we ask him . So we know that he gives us whatever we ask from him .
ERV	1%20John	5	16	Suppose you see your fellow believer sinning ( sin that does not lead to eternal death ) . You should pray for them . Then God will give them life . I am talking about people whose sin does not lead to eternal death . There is sin that leads to death . I don ’ t mean that you should pray about that kind of sin .
ERV	1%20John	5	17	Doing wrong is always sin . But there is sin that does not lead to eternal death .
ERV	1%20John	5	18	We know that those who have been made God ’ s children do not continue to sin . The Son of God keeps them safe . [ b ] The Evil One can not hurt them .
ERV	1%20John	5	19	We know that we belong to God , but the Evil One controls the whole world .
ERV	1%20John	5	20	And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding . So now we can know the one who is true , and we live in that true God . We are in his Son , Jesus Christ . He is the true God , and he is eternal life .
ERV	1%20John	5	21	So , dear children , keep yourselves away from false gods . Footnotes -

ERV	Jude	1	1	Greetings from Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James . To those who have been chosen and are loved by God the Father and have been kept safe in Jesus Christ .
ERV	Jude	1	2	Mercy , peace , and love be yours more and more . God Will Punish Those Who Do Wrong
ERV	Jude	1	3	Dear friends , I wanted very much to write to you about the salvation we all share together . But I felt the need to write to you about something else : I want to encourage you to fight hard for the faith that God gave his holy people . God gave this faith once , and it is good for all time .
ERV	Jude	1	4	Some people have secretly entered your group . These people have already been judged guilty for what they are doing . Long ago the prophets wrote about them . They are against God . They have used the grace of our God in the wrong way—to do sinful things . They refuse to follow Jesus Christ , our only Master and Lord .
ERV	Jude	1	5	I want to help you remember some things you already know : Remember that the Lord [ a ] saved his people by bringing them out of the land of Egypt . But later he destroyed all those who did not believe .
ERV	Jude	1	6	as well . - Jude 1:8 the glorious ones Literally , “ the glories. ” These seem to be some kind of angelic beings . - Jude 1:11 Korah He turned against Moses . See Num . 16:1-40 . - Jude 1:23 that … on you Literally , “ hating even their undershirt that is defiled from the flesh . ”
ERV	Jude	1	7	Also , remember the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and the other towns around them . Like those angels they were full of sexual sin and involved themselves in sexual relations that are wrong . And they suffer the punishment of eternal fire , an example for us to see .
ERV	Jude	1	8	It is the same way with these people who have entered your group . They are guided by dreams . They make themselves dirty with sin . They reject God ’ s authority and say bad things against the glorious ones . [ b ]
ERV	Jude	1	9	Not even the archangel Michael did this . Michael argued with the devil about who would have the body of Moses . But Michael did not dare to condemn even the devil for his false accusations . Instead , Michael said , “ The Lord punish you ! ”
ERV	Jude	1	10	But these people criticize things they don ’ t understand . They do understand some things . But they understand these things not by thinking , but by feeling , the way dumb animals understand things . And these are the things that destroy them .
ERV	Jude	1	11	It will be bad for them . They have followed the way that Cain went . To make money , they have given themselves to following the wrong way that Balaam went . They have fought against God like Korah [ c ] did . And like Korah , they will be destroyed .
ERV	Jude	1	12	These people are like dirty spots among you—they bring shame to you in the special meals you share together . They eat with you and have no fear . They take care of only themselves . They are like clouds without rain . The wind blows them around . They are like trees that have no fruit at harvest time and are pulled out of the ground . So they are twice dead .
ERV	Jude	1	13	Like the dirty foam on the wild waves in the sea , everyone can see the shameful things they do . They are like stars that wander in the sky . A place in the blackest darkness has been kept for them forever .
ERV	Jude	1	14	Enoch , the seventh descendant from Adam , said this about these people : “ Look , the Lord is coming with thousands and thousands of his holy angels
ERV	Jude	1	15	to judge everyone . He will punish all those who are against him for all the evil they have done in their lack of respect for him . Yes , the Lord will punish all these sinners who don ’ t honor him . He will punish them for all the evil things they have said against him. ”
ERV	Jude	1	16	These people always complain and find wrong in others . They always do the evil things they want to do . They boast about themselves . The only reason they say good things about others is to get what they want . A Warning and Things to Do
ERV	Jude	1	17	Dear friends , remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ said would happen .
ERV	Jude	1	18	They told you , “ In the last times there will be people who laugh at God and do only what they want to do—things that are against God. ”
ERV	Jude	1	19	These are the people who divide you . They are not spiritual , because they don ’ t have the Spirit .
ERV	Jude	1	20	But you , dear friends , use your most holy faith to build yourselves up even stronger . Pray with the help of the Holy Spirit .
ERV	Jude	1	21	Keep yourselves safe in God ’ s love , as you wait for the Lord Jesus Christ in his mercy to give you eternal life .
ERV	Jude	1	22	Help those who have doubts .
ERV	Jude	1	23	Rescue those who are living in danger of hell ’ s fire . There are others you should treat with mercy , but be very careful that their filthy lives don ’ t rub off on you . [ d ] Praise God
ERV	Jude	1	24	God is strong and can keep you from falling . He can bring you before his glory without any wrong in you and give you great joy .
ERV	Jude	1	25	He is the only God , the one who saves us . To him be glory , greatness , power , and authority through Jesus Christ our Lord for all time past , now , and forever . Amen .

ERV	Revelation	1	16	He held seven stars in his right hand . A sharp two-edged sword came out of his mouth . He looked like the sun shining at its brightest time .

ERV	Revelation	4	4	In a circle around the throne were
ERV	Revelation	4	2	Immediately the Spirit took control of me , and there in heaven was a throne with someone sitting on it .
ERV	Revelation	4	3	The one sitting there was as beautiful as precious stones , like jasper and carnelian . All around the throne was a rainbow with clear colors like an emerald .
ERV	Revelation	4	24	elders bowed down before the one who sits on the throne . They worshiped him who lives forever and ever . They put their crowns down before the throne and said ,
ERV	Revelation	4	5	Lightning flashes and noises of thunder came from the throne . Before the throne there were seven lamps burning , which are the seven Spirits of God .
ERV	Revelation	4	6	Also before the throne there was something that looked like a sea of glass , as clear as crystal . In front of the throne and on each side of it there were four living beings . They had eyes all over them , in front and in back .
ERV	Revelation	4	7	The first living being was like a lion . The second was like a bull . The third had a face like a man . The fourth was like a flying eagle .
ERV	Revelation	4	8	Each of these four living beings had six wings . They were covered all over with eyes , inside and out . Day and night they never stopped saying , “ Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God All-Powerful . He always was , he is , and he is coming. ”
ERV	Revelation	4	9	These living beings were giving glory and honor and thanks to the one who sits on the throne , the one who lives forever and ever . And every time they did this ,
ERV	Revelation	4	10	the
ERV	Revelation	4	11	“ Our Lord and God ! You are worthy to receive glory and honor and power . You made all things . Everything existed and was made because you wanted it . ”
ERV	Revelation	5	5	But one of the elders said to me , “ Don ’ t cry ! The Lion [ a ] from the tribe of Judah has won the victory . He is David ’ s descendant . He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals. ”
ERV	Revelation	5	2	And I saw a powerful angel , who called in a loud voice , “ Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll ? ”
ERV	Revelation	5	3	But there was no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth who could open the scroll or look inside it .
ERV	Revelation	5	4	I cried and cried because there was no one who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside .
ERV	Revelation	5	6	Then I saw a Lamb standing in the center near the throne with the four living beings around it . The elders were also around the Lamb . The Lamb looked as if it had been killed . It had seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of God that were sent into all the world .
ERV	Revelation	5	7	The Lamb came and took the scroll from the right hand of the one sitting on the throne .
ERV	Revelation	5	8	After the Lamb took the scroll , the four living beings and the
ERV	Revelation	5	24	elders bowed down before the Lamb . Each one of them had a harp . Also , they were holding golden bowls full of incense , which are the prayers of God ’ s holy people .
ERV	Revelation	5	9	And they all sang a new song to the Lamb : “ You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals , because you were killed , and with your blood sacrifice you bought people for God from every tribe , language , race of people , and nation .
ERV	Revelation	5	10	You made them to be a kingdom and to be priests for our God . And they will rule on the earth. ”
ERV	Revelation	5	11	Then I looked , and I heard the voices of many angels . The angels were around the throne , the four living beings , and the elders . There were thousands and thousands of angels—10,000 times 10,000 .
ERV	Revelation	5	12	The angels said in a loud voice , “ All power , wealth , wisdom , and strength belong to the Lamb who was killed . He is worthy to receive honor , glory , and praise ! ”
ERV	Revelation	5	13	Then I heard every created being that is in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea , everything in all these places , saying , “ All praise and honor and glory and power forever and ever to the one who sits on the throne and to the Lamb ! ”
ERV	Revelation	5	14	The four living beings said , “ Amen ! ” And the elders bowed down and worshiped . Footnotes - Revelation 5:5 Lion Used here to refer to Jesus .
ERV	Revelation	6	6	Then I heard something that sounded like a voice . The voice came from where the four living beings were . It said , “ A quart [ a ] of wheat or three quarts of barley will cost a full day ’ s pay . But don ’ t harm the supply of olive oil and wine ! ”
ERV	Revelation	6	2	I looked , and there before me was a white horse . The rider on the horse held a bow and was given a crown . He rode out to defeat the enemy and win the victory .
ERV	Revelation	6	3	The Lamb opened the second seal . Then I heard the second living being say , “ Come ! ”
ERV	Revelation	6	4	Then another horse came out , a red one . The rider on the horse was given power to take away peace from the earth so that people would kill each other . He was given a big sword .
ERV	Revelation	6	5	The Lamb opened the third seal . Then I heard the third living being say , “ Come ! ” I looked , and there before me was a black horse . The rider on the horse held a pair of scales in his hand .
ERV	Revelation	6	7	The Lamb opened the fourth seal . Then I heard the voice of the fourth living being say , “ Come ! ”
ERV	Revelation	6	8	I looked , and there before me was a pale-colored horse . The rider on the horse was death , and Hades was following close behind him . They were given power over a fourth of the earth—power to kill people with the sword , by starving , by disease , and with the wild animals of the earth .
ERV	Revelation	6	9	The Lamb opened the fifth seal . Then I saw some souls under the altar . They were the souls of those who had been killed because they were faithful to God ’ s message and to the truth they had received .
ERV	Revelation	6	10	These souls shouted in a loud voice , “ Holy and true Lord , how long until you judge the people of the earth and punish them for killing us ? ”
ERV	Revelation	6	11	Then each one of them was given a white robe . They were told to wait a short time longer . There were still some of their brothers and sisters in the service of Christ who must be killed as they were . These souls were told to wait until all the killing was finished .
ERV	Revelation	6	12	Then I watched while the Lamb opened the sixth seal . There was a great earthquake , and the sun became as black as sackcloth . [ b ] The full moon became red like blood .
ERV	Revelation	6	13	The stars in the sky fell to the earth like a fig tree dropping its figs when the wind blows .
ERV	Revelation	6	14	The sky was split in the middle and both sides rolled up like a scroll . And every mountain and island was moved from its place .
ERV	Revelation	6	15	Then all the people—the kings of the world , the rulers , the army commanders , the rich people , the powerful people , every slave , and every free person—hid themselves in caves and behind the rocks on the mountains .
ERV	Revelation	6	16	They said to the mountains and the rocks , “ Fall on us . Hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne . Hide us from the anger of the Lamb !
ERV	Revelation	6	17	The great day for their anger has come . No one can stand against it. ” Footnotes - Revelation 6:6 quart Literally , “ choinix , ” the amount of the daily ration of grain for a soldier . Equals about

ERV	Revelation	7	7	from the tribe of Simeon 12,000 from the tribe of Levi 12,000 from the tribe of Issachar 12,000
ERV	Revelation	7	2	Then I saw another angel coming from the east . This angel had the seal of the living God . The angel called out in a loud voice to the four angels . These were the four angels that God had given the power to hurt the earth and the sea . The angel said to them ,
ERV	Revelation	7	3	“ Don ’ t harm the land or the sea or the trees before we mark the foreheads of those who serve our God. ”
ERV	Revelation	7	4	Then I heard how many people had God ’ s mark on their foreheads . There were 144,000 . They were from every tribe of the people of Israel :
ERV	Revelation	7	5	from the tribe of Judah 12,000 from the tribe of Reuben 12,000 from the tribe of Gad 12,000
ERV	Revelation	7	6	from the tribe of Asher 12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali 12,000 from the tribe of Manasseh 12,000
ERV	Revelation	7	8	from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000 from the tribe of Joseph 12,000 from the tribe of Benjamin 12,000 The Great Crowd
ERV	Revelation	7	9	Then I looked , and there was a large crowd of people . There were so many people that no one could count them all . They were from every nation , tribe , race of people , and language of the earth . They were standing before the throne and before the Lamb . They all wore white robes and had palm branches in their hands .
ERV	Revelation	7	10	They shouted loudly , “ Victory belongs to our God , who sits on the throne , and to the Lamb. ”
ERV	Revelation	7	11	The elders and the four living beings were there . All the angels were standing around them and the throne . The angels bowed down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God .
ERV	Revelation	7	12	They said , “ Amen ! Praise , glory , wisdom , thanks , honor , power , and strength belong to our God forever and ever . Amen ! ”
ERV	Revelation	7	13	Then one of the elders asked me , “ Who are these people in white robes ? Where did they come from ? ”
ERV	Revelation	7	14	I answered , “ You know who they are , sir. ” And the elder said , “ These are the ones who have come out of the great suffering . They have washed their robes [ a ] with the blood of the Lamb , and they are clean and white .
ERV	Revelation	7	15	So now these people are before the throne of God . They worship God day and night in his temple . And the one who sits on the throne will protect them .
ERV	Revelation	7	16	They will never be hungry again . They will never be thirsty again . The sun will not hurt them . No heat will burn them .
ERV	Revelation	7	17	The Lamb in front of the throne will be their shepherd . He will lead them to springs of water that give life . And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. ” Footnotes - Revelation 7:14 washed their robes Meaning that they had believed in Jesus and had been made clean from sin by his blood sacrifice . See Rev . 5:9 ; Heb . 9:14 ; 10:14-22 ; Acts 22:16 ;
ERV	Revelation	7	1	Jn . 1:7 .
ERV	Revelation	8	8	The second angel blew his trumpet . Then something that looked like a big mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea . And a third of the sea became blood .
ERV	Revelation	8	2	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God . They were given seven trumpets .
ERV	Revelation	8	3	Another angel came and stood at the altar . This angel had a golden holder for incense . The angel was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all God ’ s holy people . The angel put this offering on the golden altar before the throne .
ERV	Revelation	8	4	The smoke from the incense went up from the angel ’ s hand to God . The smoke went up with the prayers of God ’ s people .
ERV	Revelation	8	5	Then the angel filled the incense holder with fire from the altar and threw it down on the earth . Then there were flashes of lightning , thunder and other noises , and an earthquake . The First of Seven Trumpet Blasts
ERV	Revelation	8	6	Then the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to blow their trumpets .
ERV	Revelation	8	7	The first angel blew his trumpet . Then hail and fire mixed with blood was poured down on the earth . And a third of the earth and all the green grass and a third of the trees were burned up .
ERV	Revelation	8	9	And a third of the created beings in the sea died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
ERV	Revelation	8	10	The third angel blew his trumpet . Then a large star , burning like a torch , fell from the sky . It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water .
ERV	Revelation	8	11	The name of the star was Bitterness . [ a ] And a third of all the water became bitter . Many people died from drinking this bitter water .
ERV	Revelation	8	12	The fourth angel blew his trumpet . Then a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were struck . So a third of them became dark . A third of the day and night was without light .
ERV	Revelation	8	13	While I watched , I heard an eagle that was flying high in the air . The eagle said in a loud voice , “ Terrible ! Terrible ! How terrible for those who live on the earth ! The terrible trouble will begin after the sounds of the trumpets that the other three angels will blow. ” Footnotes - Revelation 8:11 Bitterness Literally , “ Wormwood , ” a very bitter plant ; here , it is a symbol of bitter sorrow .
ERV	Revelation	9	9	Their chests looked like iron breastplates . The sound their wings made was like the noise of many horses and chariots hurrying into battle .
ERV	Revelation	9	2	Then the star opened the hole leading to the pit . Smoke came up from the hole like smoke from a big furnace . The sun and sky became dark because of the smoke from the hole .
ERV	Revelation	9	3	Then locusts came out of the smoke and went down to the earth . They were given the power to sting like scorpions .
ERV	Revelation	9	4	They were told not to damage the fields of grass or any plant or tree . They were to hurt only those who did not have God ’ s mark on their foreheads .
ERV	Revelation	9	5	They were not given the power to kill them but only to cause them pain for five months—pain like a person feels when stung by a scorpion .
ERV	Revelation	9	6	During those days people will look for a way to die , but they will not find it . They will want to die , but death will hide from them .
ERV	Revelation	9	7	The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle . On their heads they wore something that looked like a gold crown . Their faces looked like human faces .
ERV	Revelation	9	8	Their hair was like women ’ s hair . Their teeth were like lions ’ teeth .
ERV	Revelation	9	10	The locusts had tails with stingers like scorpions . The power they had to give people pain for five months was in their tails .
ERV	Revelation	9	11	They had a ruler , who was the angel of the bottomless pit . His name in Hebrew is Abaddon . [ a ] In Greek it is Apollyon . [ b ]
ERV	Revelation	9	12	The first terror is now past . There are still two other terrors to come . The Sixth Trumpet Blast
ERV	Revelation	9	13	The sixth angel blew his trumpet . Then I heard a voice coming from the horns on the four corners of the golden altar that is before God .
ERV	Revelation	9	14	It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , “ Free the four angels who are tied at the great river Euphrates. ”
ERV	Revelation	9	15	These four angels had been kept ready for this hour and day and month and year . The angels were set free to kill a third of all the people on the earth .
ERV	Revelation	9	16	I heard how many troops on horses were in their army . There were 200,000,000 .
ERV	Revelation	9	17	In my vision , I saw the horses and the riders on the horses . They looked like this : They had breastplates that were fiery red , dark blue , and yellow like sulfur . The heads of the horses looked like heads of lions . The horses had fire , smoke , and sulfur coming out of their mouths .
ERV	Revelation	9	18	A third of all the people on earth were killed by these three plagues coming out of the horses ’ mouths : the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur .
ERV	Revelation	9	19	The horses ’ power was in their mouths and also in their tails . Their tails were like snakes that have heads to bite and hurt people .
ERV	Revelation	9	20	The other people on earth were not killed by these plagues . But these people still did not change their hearts and turn away from worshiping the things they had made with their own hands . They did not stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood—things that can not see or hear or walk .
ERV	Revelation	9	21	They did not change their hearts and turn away from killing other people or from their evil magic , their sexual sins , and their stealing . Footnotes - Revelation 9:11 Abaddon A Hebrew name meaning “ death ” or “ destruction. ” See Job 26:6 and Ps . 88:11 . - Revelation 9:11 Apollyon A name that means “ destroyer . ”
ERV	Revelation	10	10	So I took the little scroll from the angel ’ s hand and ate it . In my mouth it tasted sweet like honey , but after I ate it , it was sour in my stomach .
ERV	Revelation	10	2	The angel was holding a small scroll . The scroll was open in his hand . He put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land .
ERV	Revelation	10	3	He shouted loudly like the roaring of a lion . After he shouted , the voices of seven thunders spoke .
ERV	Revelation	10	4	The seven thunders spoke , and I started to write . But then I heard a voice from heaven that said , “ Don ’ t write what the seven thunders said . Keep those things secret. ”
ERV	Revelation	10	5	Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven .
ERV	Revelation	10	6	The angel made a promise by the power of the one who lives forever and ever . He is the one who made the skies and all that is in them . He made the earth and all that is in it , and he made the sea and all that is in it . The angel said , “ There will be no more waiting !
ERV	Revelation	10	7	In the days when the seventh angel is ready to blow his trumpet , God ’ s secret plan will be completed—the Good News that God told to his servants , the prophets. ”
ERV	Revelation	10	8	Then I heard the same voice from heaven again . It said to me , “ Go and take the open scroll that is in the angel ’ s hand . This is the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land. ”
ERV	Revelation	10	9	So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll . He said to me , “ Take the scroll and eat it . It will be sour in your stomach , but in your mouth it will be sweet like honey. ”
ERV	Revelation	10	11	Then I was told , “ You must prophesy again about many races of people , many nations , languages , and rulers . ”
ERV	Revelation	11	11	But after three and a half days , God let life enter the two witnesses again . They stood on their feet . All those who saw them were filled with fear .
ERV	Revelation	11	2	But don ’ t measure the yard outside the temple . Leave it alone . It has been given to those who are not God ’ s people . They will show their power over the holy city for
ERV	Revelation	11	42	months .
ERV	Revelation	11	3	And I will give power to my two witnesses . And they will prophesy for
ERV	Revelation	11	1260	days . They will be dressed in sackcloth. ”
ERV	Revelation	11	4	These two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth .
ERV	Revelation	11	5	If anyone tries to hurt the witnesses , fire comes from the mouths of the witnesses and kills their enemies . Anyone who tries to hurt them will die like this .
ERV	Revelation	11	6	These witnesses have the power to stop the sky from raining during the time they are prophesying . These witnesses have power to make the water become blood . They have power to send every kind of plague to the earth . They can do this as many times as they want .
ERV	Revelation	11	7	When the two witnesses have finished telling their message , the beast will fight against them . This is the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit . It will defeat and kill them .
ERV	Revelation	11	8	The bodies of the two witnesses will lie in the street of the great city . This city is named Sodom and Egypt . These names for the city have a special meaning . This is the city where the Lord was killed .
ERV	Revelation	11	9	People from every race of people , tribe , language , and nation will look at the bodies of the two witnesses for three and a half days . The people will refuse to bury them .
ERV	Revelation	11	10	Everyone on the earth will be happy because these two are dead . They will have parties and send each other gifts . They will do this because these two prophets brought much suffering to the people living on earth .
ERV	Revelation	11	12	Then the two witnesses heard a loud voice from heaven say , “ Come up here ! ” And both of them went up into heaven in a cloud . Their enemies watched them go .
ERV	Revelation	11	13	At that same time there was a great earthquake . A tenth of the city was destroyed . And
ERV	Revelation	11	7000	people were killed in the earthquake . Those who did not die were very afraid . They gave glory to the God of heaven .
ERV	Revelation	11	14	The second terror is now past . The third terror is coming soon . The Seventh Trumpet Blast
ERV	Revelation	11	15	The seventh angel blew his trumpet . Then there were loud voices in heaven . The voices said , “ The kingdom of the world has now become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah . And he will rule forever and ever. ”
ERV	Revelation	11	16	Then the
ERV	Revelation	11	24	elders bowed down on their faces and worshiped God . These are the elders who sit on their thrones before God .
ERV	Revelation	11	17	The elders said , “ We give thanks to you , Lord God All-Powerful . You are the one who is and who always was . We thank you because you have used your great power and have begun to rule .
ERV	Revelation	11	18	The people of the world were angry , but now is the time for your anger . Now is the time for the dead to be judged . It is time to reward your servants , the prophets , and to reward your holy people , the people , great and small , who respect you . It is time to destroy those people who destroy the earth ! ”
ERV	Revelation	11	19	. - Revelation 11:19 Box of the Agreement This is like the special box kept in the Most Holy Place of the Israelite Holy Tent and , later , the Jerusalem Temple , which contained “ proof ” of the agreement between God and his people . See “ Box of the Agreement ” in the Word List .
ERV	Revelation	12	12	So rejoice , you heavens and all who live there ! But it will be terrible for the earth and sea , because the devil has gone down to you . He is filled with anger . He knows he doesn ’ t have much time. ”
ERV	Revelation	12	2	She was pregnant and cried out with pain because she was about to give birth .
ERV	Revelation	12	3	Then another wonder appeared in heaven : There was a giant red dragon there . The dragon had seven heads with a crown on each head . It also had ten horns .
ERV	Revelation	12	4	Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and threw them down to the earth . It stood in front of the woman who was ready to give birth to the baby . It wanted to eat the woman ’ s baby as soon as it was born .
ERV	Revelation	12	5	The woman gave birth to a son , who would rule all the nations with an iron rod . And her child was taken up to God and to his throne .
ERV	Revelation	12	6	The woman ran away into the desert to a place that God had prepared for her . There she would be taken care of for
ERV	Revelation	12	1260	days .
ERV	Revelation	12	7	Then there was a war in heaven . Michael [ a ] and his angels fought against the dragon . The dragon and its angels fought back ,
ERV	Revelation	12	8	but they were not strong enough . The dragon and its angels lost their place in heaven .
ERV	Revelation	12	9	above .
ERV	Revelation	12	10	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say , “ The victory and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Messiah have now come . These things have come , because the accuser of our brothers and sisters has been thrown out . He is the one who accused them day and night before our God .
ERV	Revelation	12	11	They defeated him by the blood sacrifice of the Lamb and by the message of God that they told people . They did not love their lives too much . They were not afraid of death .
ERV	Revelation	12	13	The dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth . So he chased the woman who had given birth to the child .
ERV	Revelation	12	14	But the woman was given the two wings of a great eagle . Then she could fly to the place that was prepared for her in the desert . There she would be taken care of for three and a half years . There she would be away from the dragon . [ b ]
ERV	Revelation	12	15	literally , “ snake. ” See verse
ERV	Revelation	12	16	But the earth helped the woman . The earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that came from the mouth of the dragon .
ERV	Revelation	12	17	Then the dragon was very angry with the woman . It went away to make war against all her other children . Her children are those who obey God ’ s commands and have the truth that Jesus taught .
ERV	Revelation	12	18	The dragon stood on the seashore . Footnotes - Revelation 12:7 Michael The archangel—leader of God ’ s angels . See Jude
ERV	Revelation	13	13	The second beast did great miracles . [ a ] He even made fire come down from heaven to earth while people were watching .
ERV	Revelation	13	2	This beast looked like a leopard , with feet like a bear ’ s feet . It had a mouth like a lion ’ s mouth . The dragon gave the beast all of its power and its throne and great authority .
ERV	Revelation	13	3	One of the heads of the beast looked as if it had been wounded and killed , but the death wound was healed . All the people in the world were amazed , and they all followed the beast .
ERV	Revelation	13	4	People worshiped the dragon because it had given its power to the beast , and they also worshiped the beast . They asked , “ Who is as powerful as the beast ? Who can make war against it ? ”
ERV	Revelation	13	5	The beast was allowed to boast and speak insults against God . It was allowed to use its power for
ERV	Revelation	13	42	months .
ERV	Revelation	13	6	The beast opened its mouth to insult God—to insult his name , the place where he lives , and all those who live in heaven .
ERV	Revelation	13	7	It was given power to make war against God ’ s holy people and to defeat them . It was given power over every tribe , race of people , language , and nation .
ERV	Revelation	13	8	Everyone living on earth would worship the beast . These are all the people since the beginning of the world whose names are not written in the Lamb ’ s book of life . The Lamb is the one who was killed .
ERV	Revelation	13	9	Anyone who hears these things should listen to this :
ERV	Revelation	13	10	Whoever is to be a prisoner , will be a prisoner . Whoever is to be killed with a sword , will be killed with a sword . This means that God ’ s holy people must have patience and faith . The Beast From the Earth
ERV	Revelation	13	11	Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth . He had two horns like a lamb , but he talked like a dragon .
ERV	Revelation	13	12	This beast stood before the first beast and used the same power the first beast had . He used this power to make everyone living on the earth worship the first beast . The first beast was the one that had the death wound that was healed .
ERV	Revelation	13	14	This second beast fooled the people living on earth by using the miracles that he had been given the power to do for the first beast . He ordered people to make an idol to honor the first beast , the one that was wounded by the sword but did not die .
ERV	Revelation	13	15	The second beast was given power to give life to the idol of the first beast . Then the idol could speak and order all those who did not worship it to be killed .
ERV	Revelation	13	16	The second beast also forced all people , small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to have a mark put on their right hand or on their forehead .
ERV	Revelation	13	17	No one could buy or sell without this mark . ( This mark is the name of the beast or the number of its name . )
ERV	Revelation	13	18	Anyone who has understanding can find the meaning of the beast ’ s number . This requires wisdom . This number is the number of a man . It is
ERV	Revelation	13	666	. Footnotes - Revelation 13:13 miracles False miracles—amazing acts done by the power of the devil .
ERV	Revelation	14	14	I looked and there before me , sitting on a white cloud , was one who looked like the Son of Man . He had a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand .
ERV	Revelation	14	2	And I heard a sound from heaven as loud as the crashing of floodwaters or claps of thunder . But it sounded like harpists playing their harps .
ERV	Revelation	14	3	The people sang a new song before the throne and before the four living beings and the elders . The only ones who could learn the new song were the 144,000 who had been bought from the earth . No one else could learn it .
ERV	Revelation	14	4	These are the ones who did not do sinful things with women . They kept themselves pure . Now they follow the Lamb wherever he goes . They were bought from among the people of the earth as the first to be offered to God and the Lamb .
ERV	Revelation	14	5	They are not guilty of telling lies ; they are without fault . The Three Angels
ERV	Revelation	14	6	Then I saw another angel flying high in the air . The angel had the eternal Good News to announce to the people living on earth—to every nation , tribe , language , and race of people .
ERV	Revelation	14	7	The angel said in a loud voice , “ Fear God and give him praise . The time has come for God to judge all people . Worship God . He made the heavens , the earth , the sea , and the springs of water. ”
ERV	Revelation	14	8	Then the second angel followed the first angel and said , “ She is destroyed ! The great city of Babylon is destroyed ! She made all the nations drink the wine of her sexual sin and of God ’ s anger. ”
ERV	Revelation	14	9	A third angel followed the first two angels . This third angel said in a loud voice , “ God will punish all those who worship the beast and the beast ’ s idol and agree to have the beast ’ s mark on their forehead or on their hand .
ERV	Revelation	14	10	They will drink the wine of God ’ s anger . This wine is prepared with all its strength in the cup of God ’ s anger . They will be tortured with burning sulfur before the holy angels and the Lamb .
ERV	Revelation	14	11	And the smoke from their burning pain will rise forever and ever . There will be no rest , day or night , for those who worship the beast and its idol or who wear the mark of its name. ”
ERV	Revelation	14	12	This means that God ’ s holy people must be patient . They must obey God ’ s commands and keep their faith in Jesus .
ERV	Revelation	14	13	Then I heard a voice from heaven . It said , “ Write this : From now on there are great blessings for those who belong to the Lord when they die. ” The Spirit says , “ Yes , that is true . They will rest from their hard work . What they have done will stay with them. ” The Earth Is Harvested
ERV	Revelation	14	15	Then another angel came out of the temple . This angel called to the one who was sitting on the cloud , “ Take your sickle and gather from the earth . The time to harvest has come , and the fruit on the earth is ripe. ”
ERV	Revelation	14	16	So the one who was sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth . And the earth was harvested .
ERV	Revelation	14	17	Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven . This angel also had a sharp sickle .
ERV	Revelation	14	18	And then another angel , one with power over the fire , came from the altar . He called to the angel with the sharp sickle and said , “ Take your sharp sickle and gather the bunches of grapes from the earth ’ s vine . The earth ’ s grapes are ripe. ”
ERV	Revelation	14	19	The angel swung his sickle over the earth . He gathered the earth ’ s grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God ’ s anger .
ERV	Revelation	14	20	The grapes were squeezed in the winepress outside the city . Blood flowed out of the winepress . It rose as high as the heads of the horses for a distance of
ERV	Revelation	14	200	miles Literally , “
ERV	Revelation	14	1600	stadia , ” a little less than
ERV	Revelation	14	300	km .
ERV	Revelation	15	15	Then I saw another wonder in heaven . It was great and amazing . There were seven angels bringing seven plagues . These are the last plagues , because after these , God ’ s anger is finished .
ERV	Revelation	15	2	I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire . All those who had won the victory over the beast and his idol and over the number of its name were standing by the sea . These people had harps that God had given them .
ERV	Revelation	15	3	They sang the song of Moses , the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb : “ Great and wonderful are the things you do , Lord God All-Powerful . Right and true are your ways , Ruler of the nations .
ERV	Revelation	15	4	All people will fear you , O Lord . All people will praise your name . Only you are holy . All people will come and worship before you , because it is clear that you do what is right. ”
ERV	Revelation	15	5	After this I saw the temple , the holy place of God ’ s presence , [ a ] in heaven . It was opened ,
ERV	Revelation	15	6	and the seven angels bringing the seven plagues came out . They were dressed in clean , shining linen cloth . They wore golden bands tied around their chests .
ERV	Revelation	15	7	Then one of the four living beings gave seven golden bowls to the seven angels . The bowls were filled with the anger of God , who lives forever and ever .
ERV	Revelation	15	8	The temple was filled with smoke from the glory and the power of God . No one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished . Footnotes - Revelation 15:5 holy place of God ’ s presence Literally , “ tent of the testimony. ” See “ Holy Tent ” in the Word List . Read Ex . 25:8-22 .
ERV	Revelation	16	16	Then the evil spirits gathered the rulers together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon .
ERV	Revelation	16	2	The first angel left . He poured out his bowl on the land . Then all those who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped its idol got sores that were ugly and painful .
ERV	Revelation	16	3	The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea . Then the sea became blood like a dead man ’ s blood . And everything living in the sea died .
ERV	Revelation	16	4	The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and the springs of water . The rivers and the springs of water became blood .
ERV	Revelation	16	5	Then I heard the angel of the waters say to God , “ You are the one who is and who always was . You are the Holy One . You are right in these judgments you have made .
ERV	Revelation	16	6	The people have spilled the blood of your holy people and your prophets . Now you have given those people blood to drink . This is what they deserve. ”
ERV	Revelation	16	7	And I heard the altar say , “ Yes , Lord God All-Powerful , your judgments are true and right. ”
ERV	Revelation	16	8	The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun . The sun was given power to burn the people with fire .
ERV	Revelation	16	9	The people were burned by the great heat . They cursed the name of God , who had control over these plagues . But they refused to change their hearts and lives and give glory to God .
ERV	Revelation	16	10	The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast . And darkness covered the beast ’ s kingdom . People bit their tongues because of the pain .
ERV	Revelation	16	11	They cursed the God of heaven because of their pain and the sores they had . But they refused to change their hearts and turn away from the evil things they did .
ERV	Revelation	16	12	The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates . The water in the river was dried up . This prepared the way for the rulers from the east to come .
ERV	Revelation	16	13	Then I saw three evil spirits that looked like frogs . They came out of the mouth of the dragon , out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet .
ERV	Revelation	16	14	These evil spirits are the spirits of demons . They have power to do miracles . [ a ] They go out to the rulers of the whole world to gather them for battle on the great day of God All-Powerful .
ERV	Revelation	16	15	“ Listen ! I will come at a time you don ’ t expect , like a thief . Great blessings belong to those who stay awake and keep their clothes with them . They will not have to go without clothes and be ashamed for people to see them. ”
ERV	Revelation	16	17	The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air . Then a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne . It said , “ It is finished ! ”
ERV	Revelation	16	18	Then there were flashes of lightning , noises , thunder , and a big earthquake . This was the worst earthquake that has ever happened since people have been on earth .
ERV	Revelation	16	19	The great city split into three parts . The cities of the nations were destroyed . And God did not forget to punish Babylon the Great . He gave that city the cup filled with the wine of his terrible anger .
ERV	Revelation	16	20	Every island disappeared and there were no more mountains .
ERV	Revelation	16	21	Giant hailstones fell on the people from the sky . These hailstones weighed almost
ERV	Revelation	16	100	pounds Literally , “ talanton ” or “ talent. ” A talent was about
ERV	Revelation	16	27	to
ERV	Revelation	16	36	kg (
ERV	Revelation	16	60	to
ERV	Revelation	16	80	pounds ) .
ERV	Revelation	17	17	God put the idea in their minds to do what would complete his purpose . They agreed to give the beast their power to rule until what God has said is completed .
ERV	Revelation	17	2	The rulers of the earth sinned sexually with her . The people of the earth became drunk from the wine of her sexual sin. ”
ERV	Revelation	17	3	Then the angel carried me away by the Spirit to the desert . There I saw a woman sitting on a red beast . The beast was covered with evil names . It had seven heads and ten horns .
ERV	Revelation	17	4	The woman was dressed in purple and red . She was shining with the gold , jewels , and pearls that she was wearing . She had a golden cup in her hand . This cup was filled with terribly evil things and the filth of her sexual sin .
ERV	Revelation	17	5	She had a title written on her forehead . This title has a hidden meaning . This is what was written : the great babylon mother of prostitutes and the evil things of the earth
ERV	Revelation	17	6	I saw that the woman was drunk . She was drunk with the blood of God ’ s holy people . She was drunk with the blood of those who told about their faith in Jesus . When I saw the woman , I was fully amazed .
ERV	Revelation	17	7	Then the angel said to me , “ Why are you amazed ? I will tell you the hidden meaning of this woman and the beast she rides—the beast with seven heads and ten horns .
ERV	Revelation	17	8	The beast you saw was once alive , but now it is not . However , it will come up out of the bottomless pit and go away to be destroyed . The people who live on the earth will be amazed when they see the beast , because it was once alive , is no longer living , but will come again . These are the people whose names have never been written in the book of life since the beginning of the world .
ERV	Revelation	17	9	“ You need wisdom to understand this . The seven heads on the beast are the seven hills where the woman sits . They are also seven rulers .
ERV	Revelation	17	10	Five of the rulers have already died . One of the rulers lives now , and the last ruler is coming . When he comes , he will stay only a short time .
ERV	Revelation	17	11	The beast that was once alive but is no longer living is an eighth ruler . This eighth ruler also belongs to the first seven rulers . And he will go away to be destroyed .
ERV	Revelation	17	12	“ The ten horns you saw are ten rulers . These ten rulers have not yet received their kingdom , but they will receive power to rule with the beast for one hour .
ERV	Revelation	17	13	All ten of these rulers have the same purpose . And they will give their power and authority to the beast .
ERV	Revelation	17	14	They will make war against the Lamb . But the Lamb will defeat them , because he is Lord of lords and King of kings . And with him will be his chosen and faithful followers—the people he has called to be his. ”
ERV	Revelation	17	15	Then the angel said to me , “ You saw the waters where the prostitute sits . These waters are the many peoples , the different races , nations , and languages in the world .
ERV	Revelation	17	16	The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute . They will take everything she has and leave her naked . They will eat her flesh and destroy her with fire .
ERV	Revelation	17	18	The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth . ”
ERV	Revelation	18	18	They saw the smoke from her burning . They cried out , ‘ There was never a city like this great city ! ’
ERV	Revelation	18	2	The angel shouted with a powerful voice , “ She is destroyed ! The great city of Babylon is destroyed ! She has become a home for demons . That city has become a place for every unclean spirit to live . She is a city filled with all kinds of unclean birds . She is a place where every unclean and hated animal lives .
ERV	Revelation	18	3	All the peoples of the earth have drunk the wine of her sexual sin and of God ’ s anger . The rulers of the earth sinned sexually with her , and the merchants of the world grew rich from the great wealth of her luxury. ”
ERV	Revelation	18	4	Then I heard another voice from heaven say , “ Come out of that city , my people , so that you will not share in her sins . Then you will not suffer any of the terrible punishment she will get .
ERV	Revelation	18	5	That city ’ s sins are piled up as high as heaven . God has not forgotten the wrongs she has done .
ERV	Revelation	18	6	Give that city the same as she gave to others . Pay her back twice as much as she did . Prepare wine for her that is twice as strong as the wine she prepared for others .
ERV	Revelation	18	7	She gave herself much glory and rich living . Give her that much suffering and sadness . She says to herself , ‘ I am a queen sitting on my throne . I am not a widow ; I will never be sad. ’
ERV	Revelation	18	8	So in one day she will suffer great hunger , mourning , and death . She will be destroyed by fire , because the Lord God who judges her is powerful .
ERV	Revelation	18	9	“ The rulers of the earth who sinned sexually with her and shared her wealth will see the smoke from her burning . Then they will cry and be sad because of her death .
ERV	Revelation	18	10	The rulers will be afraid of her suffering and stand far away . They will say , ‘ Terrible ! How terrible , O great city , O powerful city of Babylon ! Your punishment came in one hour ! ’
ERV	Revelation	18	11	“ And the merchants of the earth will cry and be sad for her . They will be sad because now there is no one to buy the things they sell—
ERV	Revelation	18	12	gold , silver , jewels , pearls , fine linen cloth , purple cloth , silk , and scarlet cloth , all kinds of citron wood , and all kinds of things made from ivory , expensive wood , bronze , iron , and marble .
ERV	Revelation	18	13	They also sell cinnamon , spice , incense , frankincense , myrrh , wine , olive oil , fine flour , wheat , cattle , sheep , horses , carriages , and slaves—yes , even human lives . The merchants will cry and say ,
ERV	Revelation	18	14	‘ O Babylon , the good things you wanted have left you . All your rich and fancy things have disappeared . You will never have them again. ’
ERV	Revelation	18	15	“ The merchants will be afraid of her suffering and will stand far away from her . They are the ones who became rich from selling those things to her . They will cry and be sad .
ERV	Revelation	18	16	They will say , ‘ Terrible ! How terrible for the great city ! She was dressed in fine linen ; she wore purple and scarlet cloth . She was shining with gold , jewels , and pearls !
ERV	Revelation	18	17	All these riches have been destroyed in one hour ! ’ “ Every sea captain , all those who travel on ships , the sailors , and all those who earn money from the sea stood far away from Babylon .
ERV	Revelation	18	19	They threw dust on their heads and cried loudly to show the deep sorrow they felt . They said , ‘ Terrible ! How terrible for the great city ! All those who had ships on the sea became rich because of her wealth ! But she has been destroyed in one hour !
ERV	Revelation	18	20	Be happy because of this , O heaven ! Be happy , God ’ s holy people and apostles and prophets ! God has punished her because of what she did to you. ’ ”
ERV	Revelation	18	21	Then a powerful angel picked up a large rock . This rock was as big as a large millstone . The angel threw the rock into the sea and said , “ That is how the great city of Babylon will be thrown down . It will never be found again .
ERV	Revelation	18	22	O Babylon , the music of people playing harps and other instruments , flutes and trumpets will never be heard in you again . No worker doing any job will ever be found in you again . The sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again .
ERV	Revelation	18	23	The light of a lamp will never shine in you again . The voices of a bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again . Your merchants were the world ’ s great people . All the nations were tricked by your magic .
ERV	Revelation	18	24	You are guilty of the death of the prophets , of God ’ s holy people , and of all those who have been killed on earth . ”
ERV	Revelation	19	19	Then I saw the beast and the rulers of the earth . Their armies were gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army .
ERV	Revelation	19	2	His judgments are true and right . Our God has punished the prostitute . She is the one who ruined the earth with her sexual sin . God has punished the prostitute to pay her back for the death of his servants. ”
ERV	Revelation	19	3	,
ERV	Revelation	19	4	,
ERV	Revelation	19	24	elders and the four living beings bowed down . They worshiped God , who sits on the throne . They said , “ Amen ! Hallelujah ! ”
ERV	Revelation	19	5	Then a voice came from the throne and said , “ Praise our God , all you who serve him ! Praise our God , all you small and great who honor him ! ”
ERV	Revelation	19	6	. - Revelation 19:20 miracles False miracles—amazing acts done by the power of the devil .
ERV	Revelation	19	7	Let us rejoice and be happy and give God glory ! Give God glory , because the wedding of the Lamb has come . And the Lamb ’ s bride has made herself ready .
ERV	Revelation	19	8	Fine linen was given to the bride for her to wear . The linen was bright and clean. ” ( The fine linen means the good things that God ’ s holy people did . )
ERV	Revelation	19	9	Then the angel said to me , “ Write this : Great blessings belong to those who are invited to the wedding meal of the Lamb ! ” Then the angel said , “ These are the true words of God. ”
ERV	Revelation	19	10	Then I bowed down before the angel ’ s feet to worship him . But the angel said to me , “ Don ’ t worship me ! I am a servant like you and your brothers and sisters who have the truth of Jesus . So worship God ! Because the truth of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. ” The Rider on the White Horse
ERV	Revelation	19	11	Then I saw heaven open . There before me was a white horse . The rider on the horse was called Faithful and True , because he is right in his judging and in making war .
ERV	Revelation	19	12	His eyes were like burning fire . He had many crowns on his head . A name was written on him , but he was the only one who knew its meaning .
ERV	Revelation	19	13	He was dressed in a robe dipped in blood , and he was called the Word of God .
ERV	Revelation	19	14	The armies of heaven were following the rider on the white horse . They were also riding white horses . They were dressed in fine linen , white and clean .
ERV	Revelation	19	15	A sharp sword came out of the rider ’ s mouth , a sword that he would use to defeat the nations . And he will rule the nations with a rod of iron . He will crush the grapes in the winepress of the terrible anger of God All-Powerful .
ERV	Revelation	19	16	On his robe and on his leg was written this name : king of kings and lord of lords
ERV	Revelation	19	17	Then I saw an angel standing in the sun . In a loud voice the angel said to all the birds flying in the sky , “ Come together for the great supper of God .
ERV	Revelation	19	18	Come together so that you can eat the bodies of rulers and army commanders and famous men . Come to eat the bodies of the horses and their riders and the bodies of all people—free , slave , small , and great. ”
ERV	Revelation	19	20	But the beast was captured , and the false prophet was also captured . He was the one who did the miracles [ b ] for the beast . He had used these miracles to trick those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its idol . The false prophet and the beast were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur .
ERV	Revelation	19	21	Their armies were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the rider on the horse . All the birds ate these bodies until they were full . Footnotes - Revelation 19:1 Hallelujah This means “ Praise God ! ” Also in verses
ERV	Revelation	20	20	I saw an angel coming down out of heaven . The angel had the key to the bottomless pit . The angel also held a large chain in his hand .
ERV	Revelation	20	1000	years are ended , Satan will be made free from his prison .
ERV	Revelation	20	2	The angel grabbed the dragon , that old snake , also known as the devil or Satan . The angel tied the dragon with the chain for
ERV	Revelation	20	3	Then the angel threw the dragon into the bottomless pit and closed it . The angel locked it over the dragon . The angel did this so that the dragon could not trick the people of the earth until the
ERV	Revelation	20	4	Then I saw some thrones and people sitting on them . These were the ones who had been given the power to judge . And I saw the souls of those who had been killed because they were faithful to the truth of Jesus and the message from God . They did not worship the beast or its idol . They did not receive the mark of the beast on their foreheads or on their hands . They came back to life and ruled with Christ for

ERV	Revelation	20	9	I saw Satan ’ s army march across the earth and gather around the camp of God ’ s people and the city that God loves . But fire came down from heaven and destroyed Satan ’ s army .
ERV	Revelation	20	10	And he ( the one who tricked these people ) was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur with the beast and the false prophet . There they would be tortured day and night forever and ever . People of the World Are Judged
ERV	Revelation	20	11	Then I saw a large white throne . I saw the one who was sitting on the throne . Earth and sky ran away from him and disappeared .
ERV	Revelation	20	12	And I saw those who had died , great and small , standing before the throne . Some books were opened . And another book was opened—the book of life . The people were judged by what they had done , which is written in the books .
ERV	Revelation	20	13	The sea gave up the dead who were in it . Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them . All these people were judged by what they had done .
ERV	Revelation	20	14	And Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire . This lake of fire is the second death .
ERV	Revelation	20	15	And anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire .
ERV	Revelation	21	21	The twelve gates were twelve pearls . Each gate was made from one pearl . The street of the city was made of pure gold , as clear as glass .
ERV	Revelation	21	2	And I saw the holy city , the new Jerusalem , [ a ] coming down out of heaven from God . It was prepared like a bride dressed for her husband .
ERV	Revelation	21	3	I heard a loud voice from the throne . It said , “ Now God ’ s home is with people . He will live with them . They will be his people . God himself will be with them and will be their God .
ERV	Revelation	21	4	He will wipe away every tear from their eyes . There will be no more death , sadness , crying , or pain . All the old ways are gone. ”
ERV	Revelation	21	5	The one who was sitting on the throne said , “ Look , I am making everything new ! ” Then he said , “ Write this , because these words are true and can be trusted. ”
ERV	Revelation	21	6	The one on the throne said to me , “ It is finished ! I am the Alpha and the Omega , [ b ] the Beginning and the End . I will give free water from the spring of the water of life to anyone who is thirsty .
ERV	Revelation	21	7	All those who win the victory will receive all this . And I will be their God , and they will be my children .

This is the second death. ”
ERV	Revelation	21	9	One of the seven angels came to me . This was one of the angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues . The angel said , “ Come with me . I will show you the bride , the wife of the Lamb. ”
ERV	Revelation	21	10	The angel carried me away by the Spirit to a very large and high mountain . The angel showed me the holy city , Jerusalem . The city was coming down out of heaven from God .
ERV	Revelation	21	11	The city was shining with the glory of God . It was shining bright like a very expensive jewel , like a jasper . It was clear as crystal .
ERV	Revelation	21	12	The city had a large , high wall with twelve gates . There were twelve angels at the gates . On each gate was written the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel .
ERV	Revelation	21	13	There were three gates on the east , three gates on the north , three gates on the south , and three gates on the west .
ERV	Revelation	21	14	The walls of the city were built on twelve foundation stones . On the stones were written the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
ERV	Revelation	21	15	The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod made of gold . The angel had this rod to measure the city , its gates , and its wall .
ERV	Revelation	21	16	The city was built in a square . Its length was equal to its width . The angel measured the city with the rod . The city was 12,000 stadia [ c ] long , 12,000 stadia wide , and 12,000 stadia high .
ERV	Revelation	21	17	The angel also measured the wall . It was

ERV	Revelation	21	22	I did not see a temple in the city . The Lord God All-Powerful and the Lamb were the city ’ s temple .
ERV	Revelation	21	23	The city did not need the sun or the moon to shine on it . The glory of God gave the city light . The Lamb was the city ’ s lamp .
ERV	Revelation	21	24	The peoples of the world will walk by the light given by the Lamb . The rulers of the earth will bring their glory into the city .
ERV	Revelation	21	25	The city ’ s gates will never close on any day , because there is no night there .
ERV	Revelation	21	26	The greatness and the honor of the nations will be brought into the city .
ERV	Revelation	21	27	Nothing unclean will ever enter the city . No one who does shameful things or tells lies will ever enter the city . Only those whose names are written in the Lamb ’ s book of life will enter the city .

ERV	Revelation	22	22	The angel showed me the river of the water of life , clear as crystal . The river flows from the throne of God and the Lamb .
ERV	Revelation	22	2	It flows down the middle of the street of the city . The tree of life is on each side of the river , and it produces fruit every month , twelve times a year . The leaves of the tree are for healing the nations .
