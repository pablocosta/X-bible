NIVUK	Matthew	6	28	‘ And why do you worry about clothes ? See how the flowers of the field grow . They do not labour or spin .
NIVUK	Matthew	6	29	Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendour was dressed like one of these .
NIVUK	Matthew	6	30	If that is how God clothes the grass of the field , which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire , will he not much more clothe you – you of little faith ?
NIVUK	Matthew	6	31	So do not worry , saying , “ What shall we eat ? ” or “ What shall we drink ? ” or “ What shall we wear ? ”
NIVUK	Matthew	6	32	For the pagans run after all these things , and your heavenly Father knows that you need them .
NIVUK	Matthew	6	33	But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness , and all these things will be given to you as well .
NIVUK	Matthew	6	34	Therefore do not worry about tomorrow , for tomorrow will worry about itself . Each day has enough trouble of its own .

NIVUK	Matthew	7	18	A good tree can not bear bad fruit , and a bad tree can not bear good fruit .
NIVUK	Matthew	7	19	Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
NIVUK	Matthew	7	20	Thus , by their fruit you will recognise them . True and false disciples
NIVUK	Matthew	7	21	‘ Not everyone who says to me , “ Lord , Lord , ” will enter the kingdom of heaven , but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven .
NIVUK	Matthew	7	22	Many will say to me on that day , “ Lord , Lord , did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles ? ”
NIVUK	Matthew	7	23	Then I will tell them plainly , “ I never knew you . Away from me , you evildoers ! ” The wise and foolish builders
NIVUK	Matthew	7	24	‘ Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock .
NIVUK	Matthew	7	25	The rain came down , the streams rose , and the winds blew and beat against that house ; yet it did not fall , because it had its foundation on the rock .
NIVUK	Matthew	7	26	But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand .
NIVUK	Matthew	7	27	The rain came down , the streams rose , and the winds blew and beat against that house , and it fell with a great crash. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	7	28	When Jesus had finished saying these things , the crowds were amazed at his teaching ,
NIVUK	Matthew	7	29	because he taught as one who had authority , and not as their teachers of the law . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Matthew	8	2	A man with leprosy [ a ] came and knelt before him and said , ‘ Lord , if you are willing , you can make me clean. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	8	3	Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man . ‘ I am willing , ’ he said . ‘ Be clean ! ’ Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy .

NIVUK	Matthew	8	5	When Jesus had entered Capernaum , a centurion came to him , asking for help .
NIVUK	Matthew	8	6	‘ Lord , ’ he said , ‘ my servant lies at home paralysed , suffering terribly. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	8	7	Jesus said to him , ‘ Shall I come and heal him ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	8	9	For I myself am a man under authority , with soldiers under me . I tell this one , “ Go , ” and he goes ; and that one , “ Come , ” and he comes . I say to my servant , “ Do this , ” and he does it. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	8	10	When Jesus heard this , he was amazed and said to those following him , ‘ Truly I tell you , I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith .
NIVUK	Matthew	8	11	I say to you that many will come from the east and the west , and will take their places at the feast with Abraham , Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven .
NIVUK	Matthew	8	12	But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside , into the darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ’

NIVUK	Matthew	8	16	When evening came , many who were demon-possessed were brought to him , and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all who were ill.
NIVUK	Matthew	8	17	This was to fulfil what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah : ‘ He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases. ’ [ b ] The cost of following Jesus
NIVUK	Matthew	8	18	When Jesus saw the crowd around him , he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake .
NIVUK	Matthew	8	19	Then a teacher of the law came to him and said , ‘ Teacher , I will follow you wherever you go. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	8	20	Jesus replied , ‘ Foxes have dens and birds have nests , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	8	21	Another disciple said to him , ‘ Lord , first let me go and bury my father. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	8	22	But Jesus told him , ‘ Follow me , and let the dead bury their own dead. ’ Jesus calms the storm
NIVUK	Matthew	8	23	Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him .
NIVUK	Matthew	8	24	Suddenly a furious storm came up on the lake , so that the waves swept over the boat . But Jesus was sleeping .
NIVUK	Matthew	8	25	The disciples went and woke him , saying , ‘ Lord , save us ! We ’ re going to drown ! ’
NIVUK	Matthew	8	26	He replied , ‘ You of little faith , why are you so afraid ? ’ Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves , and it was completely calm .
NIVUK	Matthew	8	27	The men were amazed and asked , ‘ What kind of man is this ? Even the winds and the waves obey him ! ’ Jesus restores two demon-possessed men
NIVUK	Matthew	8	28	When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes , [ c ] two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him . They were so violent that no one could pass that way .
NIVUK	Matthew	8	29	‘ What do you want with us , Son of God ? ’ they shouted . ‘ Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	8	30	Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding .
NIVUK	Matthew	8	31	The demons begged Jesus , ‘ If you drive us out , send us into the herd of pigs. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	8	32	He said to them , ‘ Go ! ’ So they came out and went into the pigs , and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water .
NIVUK	Matthew	8	33	Those tending the pigs ran off , went into the town and reported all this , including what had happened to the demon-possessed men .
NIVUK	Matthew	8	34	Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus . And when they saw him , they pleaded with him to leave their region .

NIVUK	Matthew	9	2	Some men brought to him a paralysed man , lying on a mat . When Jesus saw their faith , he said to the man , ‘ Take heart , son ; your sins are forgiven. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	9	3	At this , some of the teachers of the law said to themselves , ‘ This fellow is blaspheming ! ’
NIVUK	Matthew	9	4	Knowing their thoughts , Jesus said , ‘ Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts ?
NIVUK	Matthew	9	5	Which is easier : to say , “ Your sins are forgiven , ” or to say , “ Get up and walk ” ?
NIVUK	Matthew	9	6	But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. ’ So he said to the paralysed man , ‘ Get up , take your mat and go home. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	9	7	Then the man got up and went home .
NIVUK	Matthew	9	8	When the crowd saw this , they were filled with awe ; and they praised God , who had given such authority to man . The calling of Matthew
NIVUK	Matthew	9	10	While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew ’ s house , many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples .
NIVUK	Matthew	9	11	When the Pharisees saw this , they asked his disciples , ‘ Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	9	12	On hearing this , Jesus said , ‘ It is not the healthy who need a doctor , but those who are ill.
NIVUK	Matthew	9	13	But go and learn what this means : “ I desire mercy , not sacrifice. ” [ a ] For I have not come to call the righteous , but sinners. ’ Jesus questioned about fasting
NIVUK	Matthew	9	14	Then John ’ s disciples came and asked him , ‘ How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often , but your disciples do not fast ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	9	15	Jesus answered , ‘ How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them ? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them ; then they will fast .
NIVUK	Matthew	9	16	‘ No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment , for the patch will pull away from the garment , making the tear worse .
NIVUK	Matthew	9	17	Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins . If they do , the skins will burst ; the wine will run out , and the wineskins will be ruined . No , they pour new wine into new wineskins , and both are preserved. ’ Jesus raises a dead girl and heals a sick woman
NIVUK	Matthew	9	18	While he was saying this , a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and said , ‘ My daughter has just died . But come and put your hand on her , and she will live. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	9	19	Jesus got up and went with him , and so did his disciples .
NIVUK	Matthew	9	20	Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak .
NIVUK	Matthew	9	21	She said to herself , ‘ If I only touch his cloak , I will be healed. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	9	22	Jesus turned and saw her . ‘ Take heart , daughter , ’ he said , ‘ your faith has healed you. ’ And the woman was healed at that moment .
NIVUK	Matthew	9	23	When Jesus entered the synagogue leader ’ s house and saw the noisy crowd and the people playing pipes ,
NIVUK	Matthew	9	24	he said , ‘ Go away . The girl is not dead but asleep. ’ But they laughed at him .
NIVUK	Matthew	9	25	After the crowd had been put outside , he went in and took the girl by the hand , and she got up .
NIVUK	Matthew	9	26	News of this spread through all that region . Jesus heals the blind and the mute
NIVUK	Matthew	9	27	As Jesus went on from there , two blind men followed him , calling out , ‘ Have mercy on us , Son of David ! ’
NIVUK	Matthew	9	28	When he had gone indoors , the blind men came to him , and he asked them , ‘ Do you believe that I am able to do this ? ’ ‘ Yes , Lord , ’ they replied .
NIVUK	Matthew	9	29	Then he touched their eyes and said , ‘ According to your faith let it be done to you ’ ;
NIVUK	Matthew	9	30	and their sight was restored . Jesus warned them sternly , ‘ See that no one knows about this. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	9	31	But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region .
NIVUK	Matthew	9	32	While they were going out , a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus .
NIVUK	Matthew	9	33	And when the demon was driven out , the man who had been mute spoke . The crowd was amazed and said , ‘ Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	9	34	But the Pharisees said , ‘ It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons. ’ The workers are few
NIVUK	Matthew	9	35	Jesus went through all the towns and villages , teaching in their synagogues , proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and illness .
NIVUK	Matthew	9	36	When he saw the crowds , he had compassion on them , because they were harassed and helpless , like sheep without a shepherd .
NIVUK	Matthew	9	37	Then he said to his disciples , ‘ The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few .

NIVUK	Matthew	10	13	If the home is deserving , let your peace rest on it ; if it is not , let your peace return to you .

NIVUK	Matthew	10	24	‘ The student is not above the teacher , nor a servant above his master .

NIVUK	Matthew	11	3	to ask him , ‘ Are you the one who is to come , or should we expect someone else ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	11	4	Jesus replied , ‘ Go back and report to John what you hear and see :

NIVUK	Matthew	11	7	As John ’ s disciples were leaving , Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John : ‘ What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed swayed by the wind ?
NIVUK	Matthew	11	8	If not , what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in fine clothes ? No , those who wear fine clothes are in kings ’ palaces .

NIVUK	Matthew	11	18	For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , “ He has a demon. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	11	19	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , “ Here is a glutton and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners. ” But wisdom is proved right by her deeds. ’ Woe on unrepentant towns
NIVUK	Matthew	11	20	Then Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of his miracles had been performed , because they did not repent .
NIVUK	Matthew	11	21	‘ Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .

NIVUK	Matthew	12	2	When the Pharisees saw this , they said to him , ‘ Look ! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	12	3	He answered , ‘ Haven ’ t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry ?
NIVUK	Matthew	12	4	He entered the house of God , and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread – which was not lawful for them to do , but only for the priests .

NIVUK	Matthew	12	8	For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	12	9	Going on from that place , he went into their synagogue ,
NIVUK	Matthew	12	10	and a man with a shrivelled hand was there . Looking for a reason to bring charges against Jesus , they asked him , ‘ Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	12	11	He said to them , ‘ If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath , will you not take hold of it and lift it out ?
NIVUK	Matthew	12	13	Then he said to the man , ‘ Stretch out your hand. ’ So he stretched it out and it was completely restored , just as sound as the other .
NIVUK	Matthew	12	14	But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus . God ’ s chosen servant
NIVUK	Matthew	12	15	Aware of this , Jesus withdrew from that place . A large crowd followed him , and he healed all who were ill.
NIVUK	Matthew	12	16	He warned them not to tell others about him .
NIVUK	Matthew	12	17	This was to fulfil what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah :
NIVUK	Matthew	12	18	‘ Here is my servant whom I have chosen , the one I love , in whom I delight ; I will put my Spirit on him , and he will proclaim justice to the nations .
NIVUK	Matthew	12	19	He will not quarrel or cry out ; no one will hear his voice in the streets .

NIVUK	Matthew	12	21	In his name the nations will put their hope. ’ [ b ] Jesus and Beelzebul
NIVUK	Matthew	12	22	Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute , and Jesus healed him , so that he could both talk and see .
NIVUK	Matthew	12	23	All the people were astonished and said , ‘ Could this be the Son of David ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	12	24	But when the Pharisees heard this , they said , ‘ It is only by Beelzebul , the prince of demons , that this fellow drives out demons. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	12	25	Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them , ‘ Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined , and every city or household divided against itself will not stand .
NIVUK	Matthew	12	26	If Satan drives out Satan , he is divided against himself . How then can his kingdom stand ?
NIVUK	Matthew	12	27	And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul , by whom do your people drive them out ? So then , they will be your judges .
NIVUK	Matthew	12	28	But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons , then the kingdom of God has come upon you .
NIVUK	Matthew	12	29	‘ Or again , how can anyone enter a strong man ’ s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man ? Then he can plunder his house .

NIVUK	Matthew	12	38	Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him , ‘ Teacher , we want to see a sign from you. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	12	39	He answered , ‘ A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign ! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah .
NIVUK	Matthew	12	40	For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish , so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .

NIVUK	Matthew	12	45	Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself , and they go in and live there . And the final condition of that person is worse than the first . That is how it will be with this wicked generation. ’ Jesus ’ mother and brothers
NIVUK	Matthew	12	46	While Jesus was still talking to the crowd , his mother and brothers stood outside , wanting to speak to him .
NIVUK	Matthew	12	47	Someone told him , ‘ Your mother and brothers are standing outside , wanting to speak to you. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	12	48	He replied to him , ‘ Who is my mother , and who are my brothers ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	12	49	Pointing to his disciples , he said , ‘ Here are my mother and my brothers .
NIVUK	Matthew	12	50	For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother. ’ Footnotes - Matthew 12:7 Hosea 6:6 - Matthew 12:21 Isaiah 42:1-4 Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Matthew	13	13	This is why I speak to them in parables : ‘ Though seeing , they do not see ; though hearing , they do not hear or understand .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	2	Such large crowds gathered round him that he got into a boat and sat in it , while all the people stood on the shore .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	3	Then he told them many things in parables , saying : ‘ A farmer went out to sow his seed .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	4	As he was scattering the seed , some fell along the path , and the birds came and ate it up .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	5	Some fell on rocky places , where it did not have much soil . It sprang up quickly , because the soil was shallow .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	6	But when the sun came up , the plants were scorched , and they withered because they had no root .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	7	Other seed fell among thorns , which grew up and choked the plants .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	8	Still other seed fell on good soil , where it produced a crop – a hundred , sixty or thirty times what was sown .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	9	Whoever has ears , let them hear. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	13	10	The disciples came to him and asked , ‘ Why do you speak to the people in parables ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	13	11	He replied , ‘ Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you , but not to them .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	12	Whoever has will be given more , and they will have an abundance . Whoever does not have , even what they have will be taken from them .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	14	In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah : ‘ “ You will be ever hearing but never understanding ; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	15	For this people ’ s heart has become calloused ; they hardly hear with their ears , and they have closed their eyes . Otherwise they might see with their eyes , hear with their ears , understand with their hearts and turn , and I would heal them. ” [ a ]
NIVUK	Matthew	13	16	But blessed are your eyes because they see , and your ears because they hear .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	17	For truly I tell you , many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it , and to hear what you hear but did not hear it .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	18	‘ Listen then to what the parable of the sower means :
NIVUK	Matthew	13	19	when anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it , the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart . This is the seed sown along the path .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	20	The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	21	But since they have no root , they last only a short time . When trouble or persecution comes because of the word , they quickly fall away .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	22	The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word , but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word , making it unfruitful .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	23	But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it . This is the one who produces a crop , yielding a hundred , sixty or thirty times what was sown. ’ The parable of the weeds
NIVUK	Matthew	13	24	Jesus told them another parable : ‘ The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	25	But while everyone was sleeping , his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat , and went away .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	26	When the wheat sprouted and formed ears , then the weeds also appeared .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	27	‘ The owner ’ s servants came to him and said , “ Sir , didn ’ t you sow good seed in your field ? Where then did the weeds come from ? ”
NIVUK	Matthew	13	28	‘ “ An enemy did this , ” he replied . ‘ The servants asked him , “ Do you want us to go and pull them up ? ”
NIVUK	Matthew	13	29	‘ “ No , ” he answered , “ because while you are pulling up the weeds , you may uproot the wheat with them .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	30	Let both grow together until the harvest . At that time I will tell the harvesters : first collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned ; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn. ” ’ The parables of the mustard seed and the yeast
NIVUK	Matthew	13	31	He told them another parable : ‘ The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed , which a man took and planted in his field .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	32	Though it is the smallest of all seeds , yet when it grows , it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree , so that the birds come and perch in its branches. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	13	33	He told them still another parable : ‘ The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about thirty kilograms of flour until it worked all through the dough. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	13	34	Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables ; he did not say anything to them without using a parable .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	35	So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet : ‘ I will open my mouth in parables , I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world. ’ [ b ] The parable of the weeds explained
NIVUK	Matthew	13	36	Then he left the crowd and went into the house . His disciples came to him and said , ‘ Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	13	37	He answered , ‘ The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	38	The field is the world , and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom . The weeds are the people of the evil one ,
NIVUK	Matthew	13	39	and the enemy who sows them is the devil . The harvest is the end of the age , and the harvesters are angels .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	40	‘ As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire , so it will be at the end of the age .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	41	The Son of Man will send out his angels , and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	42	They will throw them into the blazing furnace , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	43	Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father . Whoever has ears , let them hear . The parables of the hidden treasure and the pearl
NIVUK	Matthew	13	44	‘ The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field . When a man found it , he hid it again , and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	45	‘ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	46	When he found one of great value , he went away and sold everything he had and bought it . The parable of the net
NIVUK	Matthew	13	47	‘ Once again , the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	48	When it was full , the fishermen pulled it up on the shore . Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets , but threw the bad away .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	49	This is how it will be at the end of the age . The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous
NIVUK	Matthew	13	50	and throw them into the blazing furnace , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	51	‘ Have you understood all these things ? ’ Jesus asked . ‘ Yes , ’ they replied .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	52	He said to them , ‘ Therefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old. ’ A prophet without honour
NIVUK	Matthew	13	53	When Jesus had finished these parables , he moved on from there .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	54	Coming to his home town , he began teaching the people in their synagogue , and they were amazed . ‘ Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers ? ’ they asked .
NIVUK	Matthew	13	55	‘ Isn ’ t this the carpenter ’ s son ? Isn ’ t his mother ’ s name Mary , and aren ’ t his brothers James , Joseph , Simon and Judas ?
NIVUK	Matthew	13	56	Aren ’ t all his sisters with us ? Where then did this man get all these things ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	13	57	And they took offence at him . But Jesus said to them , ‘ A prophet is not without honour except in his own town and in his own home. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	13	58	And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith . Footnotes - Matthew 13:15 Isaiah 6:9,10 ( see Septuagint ) - Matthew 13:35 Psalm 78:2 Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Matthew	14	14	When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd , he had compassion on them and healed those who were ill.
NIVUK	Matthew	14	2	and he said to his attendants , ‘ This is John the Baptist ; he has risen from the dead ! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	14	3	Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias , his brother Philip ’ s wife ,
NIVUK	Matthew	14	4	for John had been saying to him : ‘ It is not lawful for you to have her. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	14	5	Herod wanted to kill John , but he was afraid of the people , because they considered John a prophet .
NIVUK	Matthew	14	6	On Herod ’ s birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for the guests and pleased Herod so much
NIVUK	Matthew	14	7	that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked .
NIVUK	Matthew	14	8	Prompted by her mother , she said , ‘ Give me here on a dish the head of John the Baptist. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	14	9	The king was distressed , but because of his oaths and his dinner guests , he ordered that her request be granted
NIVUK	Matthew	14	10	and had John beheaded in the prison .
NIVUK	Matthew	14	11	His head was brought in on a dish and given to the girl , who carried it to her mother .
NIVUK	Matthew	14	12	John ’ s disciples came and took his body and buried it . Then they went and told Jesus . Jesus feeds the five thousand
NIVUK	Matthew	14	13	When Jesus heard what had happened , he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place . Hearing of this , the crowds followed him on foot from the towns .
NIVUK	Matthew	14	15	As evening approached , the disciples came to him and said , ‘ This is a remote place , and it ’ s already getting late . Send the crowds away , so that they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	14	16	Jesus replied , ‘ They do not need to go away . You give them something to eat. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	14	17	‘ We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish , ’ they answered .
NIVUK	Matthew	14	18	‘ Bring them here to me , ’ he said .
NIVUK	Matthew	14	19	And he told the people to sit down on the grass . Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven , he gave thanks and broke the loaves . Then he gave them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the people .
NIVUK	Matthew	14	20	They all ate and were satisfied , and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over .
NIVUK	Matthew	14	21	The number of those who ate was about five thousand men , besides women and children . Jesus walks on the water
NIVUK	Matthew	14	22	Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side , while he dismissed the crowd .
NIVUK	Matthew	14	23	After he had dismissed them , he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray . Later that night , he was there alone ,
NIVUK	Matthew	14	24	and the boat was already a considerable distance from land , buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it .
NIVUK	Matthew	14	25	Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them , walking on the lake .
NIVUK	Matthew	14	26	When the disciples saw him walking on the lake , they were terrified . ‘ It ’ s a ghost , ’ they said , and cried out in fear .
NIVUK	Matthew	14	27	But Jesus immediately said to them : ‘ Take courage ! It is I. Don ’ t be afraid. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	14	28	‘ Lord , if it ’ s you , ’ Peter replied , ‘ tell me to come to you on the water. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	14	29	‘ Come , ’ he said . Then Peter got down out of the boat , walked on the water and came towards Jesus .
NIVUK	Matthew	14	30	But when he saw the wind , he was afraid and , beginning to sink , cried out , ‘ Lord , save me ! ’
NIVUK	Matthew	14	31	Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him . ‘ You of little faith , ’ he said , ‘ why did you doubt ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	14	32	And when they climbed into the boat , the wind died down .
NIVUK	Matthew	14	33	Then those who were in the boat worshipped him , saying , ‘ Truly you are the Son of God. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	14	34	When they had crossed over , they landed at Gennesaret .
NIVUK	Matthew	14	35	And when the men of that place recognised Jesus , they sent word to all the surrounding country . People brought all who were ill to him
NIVUK	Matthew	14	36	and begged him to let those who were ill just touch the edge of his cloak , and all who touched it were healed . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Matthew	15	15	Peter said , ‘ Explain the parable to us. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	15	2	‘ Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders ? They don ’ t wash their hands before they eat ! ’
NIVUK	Matthew	15	3	Jesus replied , ‘ And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition ?
NIVUK	Matthew	15	4	For God said , “ Honour your father and mother ” [ a ] and “ Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death. ” [ b ]
NIVUK	Matthew	15	5	But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is “ devoted to God , ”
NIVUK	Matthew	15	6	they are not to “ honour their father or mother ” with it . Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition .
NIVUK	Matthew	15	7	You hypocrites ! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you :
NIVUK	Matthew	15	8	‘ “ These people honour me with their lips , but their hearts are far from me .
NIVUK	Matthew	15	9	They worship me in vain ; their teachings are merely human rules. ” [ c ] ’
NIVUK	Matthew	15	10	Jesus called the crowd to him and said , ‘ Listen and understand .
NIVUK	Matthew	15	11	What goes into someone ’ s mouth does not defile them , but what comes out of their mouth , that is what defiles them. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	15	12	Then the disciples came to him and asked , ‘ Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	15	13	He replied , ‘ Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots .
NIVUK	Matthew	15	14	Leave them ; they are blind guides . [ d ] If the blind lead the blind , both will fall into a pit. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	15	16	‘ Are you still so dull ? ’ Jesus asked them .
NIVUK	Matthew	15	17	‘ Don ’ t you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body ?
NIVUK	Matthew	15	18	But the things that come out of a person ’ s mouth come from the heart , and these defile them .
NIVUK	Matthew	15	19	For out of the heart come evil thoughts – murder , adultery , sexual immorality , theft , false testimony , slander .
NIVUK	Matthew	15	20	These are what defile a person ; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them. ’ The faith of a Canaanite woman
NIVUK	Matthew	15	21	Leaving that place , Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon .
NIVUK	Matthew	15	22	A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him , crying out , ‘ Lord , Son of David , have mercy on me ! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	15	23	Jesus did not answer a word . So his disciples came to him and urged him , ‘ Send her away , for she keeps crying out after us. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	15	24	He answered , ‘ I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	15	25	The woman came and knelt before him . ‘ Lord , help me ! ’ she said .
NIVUK	Matthew	15	26	He replied , ‘ It is not right to take the children ’ s bread and toss it to the dogs. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	15	27	‘ Yes it is , Lord , ’ she said . ‘ Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master ’ s table. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	15	28	Then Jesus said to her , ‘ Woman , you have great faith ! Your request is granted. ’ And her daughter was healed at that moment . Jesus feeds the four thousand
NIVUK	Matthew	15	29	Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee . Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down .
NIVUK	Matthew	15	30	Great crowds came to him , bringing the lame , the blind , the crippled , the mute and many others , and laid them at his feet ; and he healed them .
NIVUK	Matthew	15	31	The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking , the crippled made well , the lame walking and the blind seeing . And they praised the God of Israel .
NIVUK	Matthew	15	32	Jesus called his disciples to him and said , ‘ I have compassion for these people ; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat . I do not want to send them away hungry , or they may collapse on the way. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	15	33	His disciples answered , ‘ Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	15	34	‘ How many loaves do you have ? ’ Jesus asked . ‘ Seven , ’ they replied , ‘ and a few small fish. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	15	35	He told the crowd to sit down on the ground .
NIVUK	Matthew	15	36	Then he took the seven loaves and the fish , and when he had given thanks , he broke them and gave them to the disciples , and they in turn to the people .
NIVUK	Matthew	15	37	They all ate and were satisfied . Afterwards the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over .
NIVUK	Matthew	15	38	The number of those who ate was four thousand men , besides women and children .

NIVUK	Matthew	16	16	Simon Peter answered , ‘ You are the Messiah , the Son of the living God. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	16	2	He replied , ‘ When evening comes , you say , “ It will be fair weather , for the sky is red , ”
NIVUK	Matthew	16	3	and in the morning , “ Today it will be stormy , for the sky is red and overcast. ” You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky , but you can not interpret the signs of the times . [ a ]
NIVUK	Matthew	16	4	A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign , but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah. ’ Jesus then left them and went away . The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees
NIVUK	Matthew	16	5	When they went across the lake , the disciples forgot to take bread .
NIVUK	Matthew	16	6	‘ Be careful , ’ Jesus said to them . ‘ Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	16	7	They discussed this among themselves and said , ‘ It is because we didn ’ t bring any bread. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	16	8	Aware of their discussion , Jesus asked , ‘ You of little faith , why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread ?
NIVUK	Matthew	16	9	Do you still not understand ? Don ’ t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand , and how many basketfuls you gathered ?
NIVUK	Matthew	16	10	Or the seven loaves for the four thousand , and how many basketfuls you gathered ?
NIVUK	Matthew	16	11	How is it you don ’ t understand that I was not talking to you about bread ? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	16	12	Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread , but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees . Peter declares that Jesus is the Messiah
NIVUK	Matthew	16	13	When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , ‘ Who do people say the Son of Man is ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	16	14	They replied , ‘ Some say John the Baptist ; others say Elijah ; and still others , Jeremiah or one of the prophets. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	16	15	‘ But what about you ? ’ he asked . ‘ Who do you say I am ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	16	17	Jesus replied , ‘ Blessed are you , Simon son of Jonah , for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood , but by my Father in heaven .
NIVUK	Matthew	16	18	And I tell you that you are Peter , [ b ] and on this rock I will build my church , and the gates of Hades [ c ] will not overcome it .
NIVUK	Matthew	16	19	I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven ; whatever you bind on earth will be [ d ] bound in heaven , and whatever you loose on earth will be [ e ] loosed in heaven. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	16	20	Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah . Jesus predicts his death
NIVUK	Matthew	16	21	From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders , the chief priests and the teachers of the law , and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life .
NIVUK	Matthew	16	22	Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him . ‘ Never , Lord ! ’ he said . ‘ This shall never happen to you ! ’
NIVUK	Matthew	16	23	Jesus turned and said to Peter , ‘ Get behind me , Satan ! You are a stumbling-block to me ; you do not have in mind the concerns of God , but merely human concerns. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	16	24	Then Jesus said to his disciples , ‘ Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me .

NIVUK	Matthew	17	17	‘ You unbelieving and perverse generation , ’ Jesus replied , ‘ how long shall I stay with you ? How long shall I put up with you ? Bring the boy here to me. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	17	2	There he was transfigured before them . His face shone like the sun , and his clothes became as white as the light .
NIVUK	Matthew	17	3	Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah , talking with Jesus .
NIVUK	Matthew	17	4	Peter said to Jesus , ‘ Lord , it is good for us to be here . If you wish , I will put up three shelters – one for you , one for Moses and one for Elijah. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	17	5	While he was still speaking , a bright cloud covered them , and a voice from the cloud said , ‘ This is my Son , whom I love ; with him I am well pleased . Listen to him ! ’
NIVUK	Matthew	17	6	When the disciples heard this , they fell face down to the ground , terrified .
NIVUK	Matthew	17	7	But Jesus came and touched them . ‘ Get up , ’ he said . ‘ Don ’ t be afraid. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	17	8	When they looked up , they saw no one except Jesus .
NIVUK	Matthew	17	9	As they were coming down the mountain , Jesus instructed them , ‘ Don ’ t tell anyone what you have seen , until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	17	10	The disciples asked him , ‘ Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	17	11	Jesus replied , ‘ To be sure , Elijah comes and will restore all things .
NIVUK	Matthew	17	12	But I tell you , Elijah has already come , and they did not recognise him , but have done to him everything they wished . In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	17	13	Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist . Jesus heals a demon-possessed boy
NIVUK	Matthew	17	14	When they came to the crowd , a man approached Jesus and knelt before him .
NIVUK	Matthew	17	15	‘ Lord , have mercy on my son , ’ he said . ‘ He has seizures and is suffering greatly . He often falls into the fire or into the water .
NIVUK	Matthew	17	16	I brought him to your disciples , but they could not heal him. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	17	18	Jesus rebuked the demon , and it came out of the boy , and he was healed at that moment .
NIVUK	Matthew	17	19	Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked , ‘ Why couldn ’ t we drive it out ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	17	20	He replied , ‘ Because you have so little faith . Truly I tell you , if you have faith as small as a mustard seed , you can say to this mountain , “ Move from here to there , ” and it will move . Nothing will be impossible for you. ’ Jesus predicts his death a second time
NIVUK	Matthew	17	22	When they came together in Galilee , he said to them , ‘ The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men .
NIVUK	Matthew	17	23	They will kill him , and on the third day he will be raised to life. ’ And the disciples were filled with grief . The temple tax
NIVUK	Matthew	17	24	After Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum , the collectors of the two-drachma temple tax came to Peter and asked , ‘ Doesn ’ t your teacher pay the temple tax ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	17	25	‘ Yes , he does , ’ he replied . When Peter came into the house , Jesus was the first to speak . ‘ What do you think , Simon ? ’ he asked . ‘ From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes – from their own children or from others ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	17	26	‘ From others , ’ Peter answered . ‘ Then the children are exempt , ’ Jesus said to him .
NIVUK	Matthew	17	27	‘ But so that we may not cause offence , go to the lake and throw out your line . Take the first fish you catch ; open its mouth and you will find a four-drachma coin . Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours. ’ Footnotes - Matthew 17:21 Some manuscripts include here words similar to Mark 9:29 .

NIVUK	Matthew	18	18	‘ Truly I tell you , whatever you bind on earth will be [ e ] bound in heaven , and whatever you loose on earth will be [ f ] loosed in heaven .
NIVUK	Matthew	18	2	He called a little child to him , and placed the child among them .
NIVUK	Matthew	18	3	And he said : ‘ Truly I tell you , unless you change and become like little children , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven .
NIVUK	Matthew	18	4	Therefore , whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
NIVUK	Matthew	18	5	And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me . Causing to stumble
NIVUK	Matthew	18	6	‘ If anyone causes one of these little ones – those who believe in me – to stumble , it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung round their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea .
NIVUK	Matthew	18	7	Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble ! Such things must come , but woe to the person through whom they come !
NIVUK	Matthew	18	8	If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off and throw it away . It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire .
NIVUK	Matthew	18	9	And if your eye causes you to stumble , gouge it out and throw it away . It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell . The parable of the wandering sheep
NIVUK	Matthew	18	10	‘ See that you do not despise one of these little ones . For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven .
NIVUK	Matthew	18	12	‘ What do you think ? If a man owns a hundred sheep , and one of them wanders away , will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off ?
NIVUK	Matthew	18	13	And if he finds it , truly I tell you , he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off .
NIVUK	Matthew	18	14	In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish . Dealing with sin in the church
NIVUK	Matthew	18	15	‘ If your brother or sister [ b ] sins , [ c ] go and point out their fault , just between the two of you . If they listen to you , you have won them over .
NIVUK	Matthew	18	16	But if they will not listen , take one or two others along , so that “ every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. ” [ d ]
NIVUK	Matthew	18	17	If they still refuse to listen , tell it to the church ; and if they refuse to listen even to the church , treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector .
NIVUK	Matthew	18	19	‘ Again , truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for , it will be done for them by my Father in heaven .

NIVUK	Matthew	18	22	Jesus answered , ‘ I tell you , not seven times , but seventy-seven times . [ g ]
NIVUK	Matthew	18	23	‘ Therefore , the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants .
NIVUK	Matthew	18	24	As he began the settlement , a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold [ h ] was brought to him .
NIVUK	Matthew	18	25	Since he was not able to pay , the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt .
NIVUK	Matthew	18	26	‘ At this the servant fell on his knees before him . “ Be patient with me , ” he begged , “ and I will pay back everything. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	18	27	The servant ’ s master took pity on him , cancelled the debt and let him go .
NIVUK	Matthew	18	28	‘ But when that servant went out , he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins . [ i ] He grabbed him and began to choke him . “ Pay back what you owe me ! ” he demanded .
NIVUK	Matthew	18	29	‘ His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him , “ Be patient with me , and I will pay it back. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	18	30	‘ But he refused . Instead , he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt .
NIVUK	Matthew	18	31	When the other servants saw what had happened , they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened .
NIVUK	Matthew	18	32	‘ Then the master called the servant in . “ You wicked servant , ” he said , “ I cancelled all that debt of yours because you begged me to .
NIVUK	Matthew	18	33	Shouldn ’ t you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you ? ”
NIVUK	Matthew	18	34	In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured , until he should pay back all he owed .

NIVUK	Matthew	19	2	Large crowds followed him , and he healed them there .
NIVUK	Matthew	19	3	Some Pharisees came to him to test him . They asked , ‘ Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	19	4	‘ Haven ’ t you read , ’ he replied , ‘ that at the beginning the Creator “ made them male and female , ” [ a ]
NIVUK	Matthew	19	5	and said , “ For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife , and the two will become one flesh ” [ b ] ?
NIVUK	Matthew	19	6	So they are no longer two , but one flesh . Therefore what God has joined together , let no one separate. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	19	7	‘ Why then , ’ they asked , ‘ did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	19	8	Jesus replied , ‘ Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard . But it was not this way from the beginning .
NIVUK	Matthew	19	9	I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife , except for sexual immorality , and marries another woman commits adultery. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	19	10	The disciples said to him , ‘ If this is the situation between a husband and wife , it is better not to marry. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	19	11	Jesus replied , ‘ Not everyone can accept this word , but only those to whom it has been given .
NIVUK	Matthew	19	12	For there are eunuchs who were born that way , and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others – and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven . The one who can accept this should accept it. ’ The little children and Jesus
NIVUK	Matthew	19	13	Then people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them . But the disciples rebuked them .
NIVUK	Matthew	19	14	Jesus said , ‘ Let the little children come to me , and do not hinder them , for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	19	15	When he had placed his hands on them , he went on from there . The rich and the kingdom of God
NIVUK	Matthew	19	16	Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked , ‘ Teacher , what good thing must I do to get eternal life ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	19	17	‘ Why do you ask me about what is good ? ’ Jesus replied . ‘ There is only One who is good . If you want to enter life , keep the commandments. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	19	18	‘ Which ones ? ’ he enquired . Jesus replied , ‘ “ You shall not murder , you shall not commit adultery , you shall not steal , you shall not give false testimony ,
NIVUK	Matthew	19	20	‘ All these I have kept , ’ the young man said . ‘ What do I still lack ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	19	21	Jesus answered , ‘ If you want to be perfect , go , sell your possessions and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come , follow me. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	19	22	When the young man heard this , he went away sad , because he had great wealth .
NIVUK	Matthew	19	23	Then Jesus said to his disciples , ‘ Truly I tell you , it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven .
NIVUK	Matthew	19	24	Again I tell you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	19	25	When the disciples heard this , they were greatly astonished and asked , ‘ Who then can be saved ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	19	26	Jesus looked at them and said , ‘ With man this is impossible , but with God all things are possible. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	19	27	Peter answered him , ‘ We have left everything to follow you ! What then will there be for us ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	19	28	Jesus said to them , ‘ Truly I tell you , at the renewal of all things , when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne , you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
NIVUK	Matthew	19	29	And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife [ e ] or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life .
NIVUK	Matthew	19	30	But many who are first will be last , and many who are last will be first .

NIVUK	Matthew	20	20	Then the mother of Zebedee ’ s sons came to Jesus with her sons and , kneeling down , asked a favour of him .
NIVUK	Matthew	20	2	He agreed to pay them a denarius [ a ] for the day and sent them into his vineyard .
NIVUK	Matthew	20	3	‘ About nine in the morning he went out and saw others standing in the market-place doing nothing .
NIVUK	Matthew	20	4	He told them , “ You also go and work in my vineyard , and I will pay you whatever is right. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	20	5	So they went . ‘ He went out again about noon and about three in the afternoon and did the same thing .
NIVUK	Matthew	20	6	About five in the afternoon he went out and found still others standing around . He asked them , “ Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing ? ”
NIVUK	Matthew	20	7	‘ “ Because no one has hired us , ” they answered . ‘ He said to them , “ You also go and work in my vineyard. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	20	8	‘ When evening came , the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman , “ Call the workers and pay them their wages , beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	20	9	‘ The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius .
NIVUK	Matthew	20	10	So when those came who were hired first , they expected to receive more . But each one of them also received a denarius .
NIVUK	Matthew	20	11	When they received it , they began to grumble against the landowner .
NIVUK	Matthew	20	12	“ These who were hired last worked only one hour , ” they said , “ and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	20	13	‘ But he answered one of them , “ I am not being unfair to you , friend . Didn ’ t you agree to work for a denarius ?
NIVUK	Matthew	20	14	Take your pay and go . I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you .
NIVUK	Matthew	20	15	Don ’ t I have the right to do what I want with my own money ? Or are you envious because I am generous ? ”
NIVUK	Matthew	20	16	‘ So the last will be first , and the first will be last. ’ Jesus predicts his death a third time
NIVUK	Matthew	20	17	Now Jesus was going up to Jerusalem . On the way , he took the Twelve aside and said to them ,
NIVUK	Matthew	20	18	‘ We are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law . They will condemn him to death
NIVUK	Matthew	20	19	and will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified . On the third day he will be raised to life ! ’ A mother ’ s request
NIVUK	Matthew	20	21	‘ What is it you want ? ’ he asked . She said , ‘ Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	20	22	‘ You don ’ t know what you are asking , ’ Jesus said to them . ‘ Can you drink the cup I am going to drink ? ’ ‘ We can , ’ they answered .
NIVUK	Matthew	20	23	Jesus said to them , ‘ You will indeed drink from my cup , but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant . These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	20	24	When the ten heard about this , they were indignant with the two brothers .
NIVUK	Matthew	20	25	Jesus called them together and said , ‘ You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them , and their high officials exercise authority over them .
NIVUK	Matthew	20	26	Not so with you . Instead , whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant ,
NIVUK	Matthew	20	27	and whoever wants to be first must be your slave –
NIVUK	Matthew	20	28	just as the Son of Man did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give his life as a ransom for many. ’ Two blind men receive sight
NIVUK	Matthew	20	29	As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho , a large crowd followed him .
NIVUK	Matthew	20	30	Two blind men were sitting by the roadside , and when they heard that Jesus was passing by , they shouted , ‘ Lord , Son of David , have mercy on us ! ’
NIVUK	Matthew	20	31	The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet , but they shouted all the louder , ‘ Lord , Son of David , have mercy on us ! ’
NIVUK	Matthew	20	32	Jesus stopped and called them . ‘ What do you want me to do for you ? ’ he asked .
NIVUK	Matthew	20	33	‘ Lord , ’ they answered , ‘ we want our sight. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	20	34	Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes . Immediately they received their sight and followed him . Footnotes - Matthew 20:2 A denarius was the usual daily wage of a day labourer . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Matthew	21	21	Jesus replied , ‘ Truly I tell you , if you have faith and do not doubt , not only can you do what was done to the fig-tree , but also you can say to this mountain , “ Go , throw yourself into the sea , ” and it will be done .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	2	saying to them , ‘ Go to the village ahead of you , and at once you will find a donkey tied there , with her colt by her . Untie them and bring them to me .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	3	If anyone says anything to you , say that the Lord needs them , and he will send them right away. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	21	4	This took place to fulfil what was spoken through the prophet :
NIVUK	Matthew	21	5	‘ Say to Daughter Zion , “ See , your king comes to you , gentle and riding on a donkey , and on a colt , the foal of a donkey. ” ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	Matthew	21	6	The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	7	They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them for Jesus to sit on .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	8	A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road , while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	9	The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted , ‘ Hosanna [ b ] to the Son of David ! ’ ‘ Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! ’ [ c ] ‘ Hosanna [ d ] in the highest heaven ! ’
NIVUK	Matthew	21	10	When Jesus entered Jerusalem , the whole city was stirred and asked , ‘ Who is this ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	21	11	The crowds answered , ‘ This is Jesus , the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee. ’ Jesus at the temple
NIVUK	Matthew	21	12	Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there . He overturned the tables of the money-changers and the benches of those selling doves .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	13	‘ It is written , ’ he said to them , ‘ “ My house will be called a house of prayer , ” [ e ] but you are making it “ a den of robbers. ” [ f ] ’
NIVUK	Matthew	21	14	The blind and the lame came to him at the temple , and he healed them .

NIVUK	Matthew	21	16	‘ Do you hear what these children are saying ? ’ they asked him . ‘ Yes , ’ replied Jesus , ‘ have you never read , ‘ “ From the lips of children and infants you , Lord , have called forth your praise ” [ g ] ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	21	17	And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany , where he spent the night . Jesus curses a fig-tree
NIVUK	Matthew	21	18	Early in the morning , as Jesus was on his way back to the city , he was hungry .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	19	Seeing a fig-tree by the road , he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves . Then he said to it , ‘ May you never bear fruit again ! ’ Immediately the tree withered .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	20	When the disciples saw this , they were amazed . ‘ How did the fig-tree wither so quickly ? ’ they asked .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	22	If you believe , you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer. ’ The authority of Jesus questioned
NIVUK	Matthew	21	23	Jesus entered the temple courts , and , while he was teaching , the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him . ‘ By what authority are you doing these things ? ’ they asked . ‘ And who gave you this authority ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	21	24	Jesus replied , ‘ I will also ask you one question . If you answer me , I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	25	John ’ s baptism – where did it come from ? Was it from heaven , or of human origin ? ’ They discussed it among themselves and said , ‘ If we say , “ From heaven ” , he will ask , “ Then why didn ’ t you believe him ? ”
NIVUK	Matthew	21	26	But if we say , “ Of human origin ” – we are afraid of the people , for they all hold that John was a prophet. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	21	27	So they answered Jesus , ‘ We don ’ t know. ’ Then he said , ‘ Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things . The parable of the two sons
NIVUK	Matthew	21	28	‘ What do you think ? There was a man who had two sons . He went to the first and said , “ Son , go and work today in the vineyard. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	21	29	‘ “ I will not , ” he answered , but later he changed his mind and went .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	30	‘ Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing . He answered , “ I will , sir , ” but he did not go .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	31	‘ Which of the two did what his father wanted ? ’ ‘ The first , ’ they answered . Jesus said to them , ‘ Truly I tell you , the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	32	For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness , and you did not believe him , but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did . And even after you saw this , you did not repent and believe him . The parable of the tenants
NIVUK	Matthew	21	33	‘ Listen to another parable : there was a landowner who planted a vineyard . He put a wall round it , dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower . Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	34	When the harvest time approached , he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	35	‘ The tenants seized his servants ; they beat one , killed another , and stoned a third .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	36	Then he sent other servants to them , more than the first time , and the tenants treated them in the same way .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	37	Last of all , he sent his son to them . “ They will respect my son , ” he said .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	38	‘ But when the tenants saw the son , they said to each other , “ This is the heir . Come , let ’ s kill him and take his inheritance. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	21	39	So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him .
NIVUK	Matthew	21	40	‘ Therefore , when the owner of the vineyard comes , what will he do to those tenants ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	21	41	‘ He will bring those wretches to a wretched end , ’ they replied , ‘ and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants , who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	21	42	Jesus said to them , ‘ Have you never read in the Scriptures : ‘ “ The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ; the Lord has done this , and it is marvellous in our eyes ” [ h ] ?
NIVUK	Matthew	21	43	‘ Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit .

NIVUK	Matthew	22	22	When they heard this , they were amazed . So they left him and went away . Marriage at the resurrection
NIVUK	Matthew	22	2	‘ The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	3	He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come , but they refused to come .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	4	‘ Then he sent some more servants and said , “ Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner : my oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered , and everything is ready . Come to the wedding banquet. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	22	5	‘ But they paid no attention and went off – one to his field , another to his business .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	6	The rest seized his servants , ill-treated them and killed them .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	7	The king was enraged . He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	8	‘ Then he said to his servants , “ The wedding banquet is ready , but those I invited did not deserve to come .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	9	So go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	22	10	So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find , the bad as well as the good , and the wedding hall was filled with guests .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	11	‘ But when the king came in to see the guests , he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	12	He asked , “ How did you get in here without wedding clothes , friend ? ” The man was speechless .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	13	‘ Then the king told the attendants , “ Tie him hand and foot , and throw him outside , into the darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	22	14	‘ For many are invited , but few are chosen. ’ Paying the poll-tax to Caesar
NIVUK	Matthew	22	15	Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	16	They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians . ‘ Teacher , ’ they said , ‘ we know that you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth . You aren ’ t swayed by others , because you pay no attention to who they are .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	17	Tell us then , what is your opinion ? Is it right to pay the poll-tax [ a ] to Caesar or not ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	22	18	But Jesus , knowing their evil intent , said , ‘ You hypocrites , why are you trying to trap me ?
NIVUK	Matthew	22	19	Show me the coin used for paying the tax. ’ They brought him a denarius ,
NIVUK	Matthew	22	20	and he asked them , ‘ Whose image is this ? And whose inscription ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	22	21	‘ Caesar ’ s , ’ they replied . Then he said to them , ‘ So give back to Caesar what is Caesar ’ s , and to God what is God ’ s. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	22	23	That same day the Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection , came to him with a question .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	24	‘ Teacher , ’ they said , ‘ Moses told us that if a man dies without having children , his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for him .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	25	Now there were seven brothers among us . The first one married and died , and since he had no children , he left his wife to his brother .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	26	The same thing happened to the second and third brother , right on down to the seventh .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	27	Finally , the woman died .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	28	Now then , at the resurrection , whose wife will she be of the seven , since all of them were married to her ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	22	29	Jesus replied , ‘ You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	30	At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage ; they will be like the angels in heaven .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	31	But about the resurrection of the dead – have you not read what God said to you ,
NIVUK	Matthew	22	32	“ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ” [ b ] ? He is not the God of the dead but of the living. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	22	33	When the crowds heard this , they were astonished at his teaching . The greatest commandment
NIVUK	Matthew	22	34	Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees , the Pharisees got together .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	35	One of them , an expert in the law , tested him with this question :
NIVUK	Matthew	22	36	‘ Teacher , which is the greatest commandment in the Law ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	22	37	Jesus replied : ‘ “ Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. ” [ c ]
NIVUK	Matthew	22	38	This is the first and greatest commandment .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	39	And the second is like it : “ Love your neighbour as yourself. ” [ d ]
NIVUK	Matthew	22	40	All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments. ’ Whose son is the Messiah ?
NIVUK	Matthew	22	41	While the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them ,
NIVUK	Matthew	22	42	‘ What do you think about the Messiah ? Whose son is he ? ’ ‘ The son of David , ’ they replied .
NIVUK	Matthew	22	43	He said to them , ‘ How is it then that David , speaking by the Spirit , calls him “ Lord ” ? For he says ,
NIVUK	Matthew	22	44	‘ “ The Lord said to my Lord : ‘ Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet. ’ ” [ e ]
NIVUK	Matthew	22	45	If then David calls him “ Lord ” , how can he be his son ? ’

NIVUK	Matthew	23	23	‘ Woe to you , teachers of the law and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! You give a tenth of your spices – mint , dill and cumin . But you have neglected the more important matters of the law – justice , mercy and faithfulness . You should have practised the latter , without neglecting the former .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	2	‘ The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses ’ seat .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	3	So you must be careful to do everything they tell you . But do not do what they do , for they do not practise what they preach .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	4	They tie up heavy , cumbersome loads and put them on other people ’ s shoulders , but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	5	‘ Everything they do is done for people to see : they make their phylacteries [ a ] wide and the tassels on their garments long ;
NIVUK	Matthew	23	6	they love the place of honour at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues ;
NIVUK	Matthew	23	7	they love to be greeted with respect in the market-places and to be called “ Rabbi ” by others .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	8	‘ But you are not to be called “ Rabbi ” , for you have one Teacher , and you are all brothers .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	9	And do not call anyone on earth “ father ” , for you have one Father , and he is in heaven .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	10	Nor are you to be called instructors , for you have one Instructor , the Messiah .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	11	The greatest among you will be your servant .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	12	For those who exalt themselves will be humbled , and those who humble themselves will be exalted . Seven woes on the teachers of the law and the Pharisees
NIVUK	Matthew	23	13	‘ Woe to you , teachers of the law and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people ’ s faces . You yourselves do not enter , nor will you let those enter who are trying to .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	15	‘ Woe to you , teachers of the law and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert , and when you have succeeded , you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	16	‘ Woe to you , blind guides ! You say , “ If anyone swears by the temple , it means nothing ; but anyone who swears by the gold of the temple is bound by that oath. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	23	17	You blind fools ! Which is greater : the gold , or the temple that makes the gold sacred ?
NIVUK	Matthew	23	18	You also say , “ If anyone swears by the altar , it means nothing ; but anyone who swears by the gift on the altar is bound by that oath. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	23	19	You blind men ! Which is greater : the gift , or the altar that makes the gift sacred ?
NIVUK	Matthew	23	20	Therefore , anyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	21	And anyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	22	And anyone who swears by heaven swears by God ’ s throne and by the one who sits on it .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	24	You blind guides ! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	25	‘ Woe to you , teachers of the law and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! You clean the outside of the cup and dish , but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	26	Blind Pharisee ! First clean the inside of the cup and dish , and then the outside also will be clean .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	27	‘ Woe to you , teachers of the law and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! You are like whitewashed tombs , which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	28	In the same way , on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	29	‘ Woe to you , teachers of the law and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	30	And you say , “ If we had lived in the days of our ancestors , we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	23	31	So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	32	Go ahead , then , and complete what your ancestors started !
NIVUK	Matthew	23	33	‘ You snakes ! You brood of vipers ! How will you escape being condemned to hell ?
NIVUK	Matthew	23	34	Therefore I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers . Some of them you will kill and crucify ; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	35	And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth , from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah , whom you murdered between the temple and the altar .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	36	Truly I tell you , all this will come upon this generation .
NIVUK	Matthew	23	37	‘ Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you , how often I have longed to gather your children together , as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings , and you were not willing .

NIVUK	Matthew	24	24	For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive , if possible , even the elect .
NIVUK	Matthew	24	2	‘ Do you see all these things ? ’ he asked . ‘ Truly I tell you , not one stone here will be left on another ; every one will be thrown down. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	24	3	As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives , the disciples came to him privately . ‘ Tell us , ’ they said , ‘ when will this happen , and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	24	4	Jesus answered : ‘ Watch out that no one deceives you .
NIVUK	Matthew	24	5	For many will come in my name , claiming , “ I am the Messiah , ” and will deceive many .
NIVUK	Matthew	24	6	You will hear of wars and rumours of wars , but see to it that you are not alarmed . Such things must happen , but the end is still to come .

NIVUK	Matthew	24	9	‘ Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death , and you will be hated by all nations because of me .
NIVUK	Matthew	24	10	At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other ,
NIVUK	Matthew	24	11	and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people .
NIVUK	Matthew	24	12	Because of the increase of wickedness , the love of most will grow cold ,

NIVUK	Matthew	24	18	Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak .
NIVUK	Matthew	24	19	How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers !
NIVUK	Matthew	24	20	Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath .
NIVUK	Matthew	24	21	For then there will be great distress , unequalled from the beginning of the world until now – and never to be equalled again .
NIVUK	Matthew	24	22	‘ If those days had not been cut short , no one would survive , but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened .
NIVUK	Matthew	24	23	At that time if anyone says to you , “ Look , here is the Messiah ! ” or , “ There he is ! ” do not believe it .
NIVUK	Matthew	24	25	See , I have told you in advance .

NIVUK	Matthew	24	32	‘ Now learn this lesson from the fig-tree : as soon as its twigs become tender and its leaves come out , you know that summer is near .

NIVUK	Matthew	24	36	‘ But about that day or hour no one knows , not even the angels in heaven , nor the Son , [ f ] but only the Father .
NIVUK	Matthew	24	37	As it was in the days of Noah , so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man .
NIVUK	Matthew	24	38	For in the days before the flood , people were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , up to the day Noah entered the ark ;
NIVUK	Matthew	24	39	and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away . That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man .
NIVUK	Matthew	24	40	Two men will be in the field ; one will be taken and the other left .
NIVUK	Matthew	24	41	Two women will be grinding with a hand mill ; one will be taken and the other left .
NIVUK	Matthew	24	42	‘ Therefore keep watch , because you do not know on what day your Lord will come .
NIVUK	Matthew	24	43	But understand this : if the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming , he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into .
NIVUK	Matthew	24	44	So you also must be ready , because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him .
NIVUK	Matthew	24	45	‘ Who then is the faithful and wise servant , whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time ?
NIVUK	Matthew	24	46	It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns .

NIVUK	Matthew	24	49	and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards .

NIVUK	Matthew	25	25	So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground . See , here is what belongs to you. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	25	2	Five of them were foolish and five were wise .
NIVUK	Matthew	25	3	The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them .
NIVUK	Matthew	25	4	The wise ones , however , took oil in jars along with their lamps .
NIVUK	Matthew	25	5	The bridegroom was a long time in coming , and they all became drowsy and fell asleep .
NIVUK	Matthew	25	6	‘ At midnight the cry rang out : “ Here ’ s the bridegroom ! Come out to meet him ! ”
NIVUK	Matthew	25	7	‘ Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps .
NIVUK	Matthew	25	8	The foolish ones said to the wise , “ Give us some of your oil ; our lamps are going out. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	25	9	‘ “ No , ” they replied , “ there may not be enough for both us and you . Instead , go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	25	10	‘ But while they were on their way to buy the oil , the bridegroom arrived . The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet . And the door was shut .

NIVUK	Matthew	25	14	‘ Again , it will be like a man going on a journey , who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them .
NIVUK	Matthew	25	15	To one he gave five bags of gold , to another two bags , and to another one bag , [ a ] each according to his ability . Then he went on his journey .
NIVUK	Matthew	25	16	The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more .
NIVUK	Matthew	25	17	So also , the one with two bags of gold gained two more .
NIVUK	Matthew	25	18	But the man who had received one bag went off , dug a hole in the ground and hid his master ’ s money .

NIVUK	Matthew	25	26	‘ His master replied , “ You wicked , lazy servant ! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed ?
NIVUK	Matthew	25	27	Well then , you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers , so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest .
NIVUK	Matthew	25	28	‘ “ So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags .
NIVUK	Matthew	25	29	For whoever has will be given more , and they will have an abundance . Whoever does not have , even what they have will be taken from them .

NIVUK	Matthew	25	32	All the nations will be gathered before him , and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
NIVUK	Matthew	25	33	He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left .
NIVUK	Matthew	25	34	‘ Then the King will say to those on his right , “ Come , you who are blessed by my Father ; take your inheritance , the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world .
NIVUK	Matthew	25	35	For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat , I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink , I was a stranger and you invited me in ,

NIVUK	Matthew	26	2	‘ As you know , the Passover is two days away – and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	3	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest , whose name was Caiaphas ,

NIVUK	Matthew	26	7	a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume , which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	8	When the disciples saw this , they were indignant . ‘ Why this waste ? ’ they asked .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	9	‘ This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	10	Aware of this , Jesus said to them , ‘ Why are you bothering this woman ? She has done a beautiful thing to me .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	11	The poor you will always have with you , [ a ] but you will not always have me .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	12	When she poured this perfume on my body , she did it to prepare me for burial .

NIVUK	Matthew	26	14	Then one of the Twelve – the one called Judas Iscariot – went to the chief priests
NIVUK	Matthew	26	15	and asked , ‘ What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you ? ’ So they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	16	From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over . The Last Supper
NIVUK	Matthew	26	17	On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread , the disciples came to Jesus and asked , ‘ Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	18	He replied , ‘ Go into the city to a certain man and tell him , “ The Teacher says : my appointed time is near . I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house. ” ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	19	So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	20	When evening came , Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	21	And while they were eating , he said , ‘ Truly I tell you , one of you will betray me. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	22	They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other , ‘ Surely you don ’ t mean me , Lord ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	23	Jesus replied , ‘ The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	24	The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him . But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man ! It would be better for him if he had not been born. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	25	Then Judas , the one who would betray him , said , ‘ Surely you don ’ t mean me , Rabbi ? ’ Jesus answered , ‘ You have said so. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	27	Then he took a cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them , saying , ‘ Drink from it , all of you .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	28	This is my blood of the [ b ] covenant , which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	29	I tell you , I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father ’ s kingdom. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	30	When they had sung a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives . Jesus predicts Peter ’ s denial
NIVUK	Matthew	26	31	Then Jesus told them , ‘ This very night you will all fall away on account of me , for it is written : ‘ “ I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. ” [ c ]
NIVUK	Matthew	26	32	But after I have risen , I will go ahead of you into Galilee. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	33	Peter replied , ‘ Even if all fall away on account of you , I never will. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	34	‘ Truly I tell you , ’ Jesus answered , ‘ this very night , before the cock crows , you will disown me three times. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	35	But Peter declared , ‘ Even if I have to die with you , I will never disown you. ’ And all the other disciples said the same . Gethsemane
NIVUK	Matthew	26	36	Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane , and he said to them , ‘ Sit here while I go over there and pray. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	37	He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him , and he began to be sorrowful and troubled .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	38	Then he said to them , ‘ My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death . Stay here and keep watch with me. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	39	Going a little farther , he fell with his face to the ground and prayed , ‘ My Father , if it is possible , may this cup be taken from me . Yet not as I will , but as you will. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	40	Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping . ‘ Couldn ’ t you men keep watch with me for one hour ? ’ he asked Peter .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	41	‘ Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation . The spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	42	He went away a second time and prayed , ‘ My Father , if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it , may your will be done. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	43	When he came back , he again found them sleeping , because their eyes were heavy .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	44	So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time , saying the same thing .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	45	Then he returned to the disciples and said to them , ‘ Are you still sleeping and resting ? Look , the hour has come , and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	46	Rise ! Let us go ! Here comes my betrayer ! ’ Jesus arrested
NIVUK	Matthew	26	47	While he was still speaking , Judas , one of the Twelve , arrived . With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs , sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	48	Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them : ‘ The one I kiss is the man ; arrest him. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	49	Going at once to Jesus , Judas said , ‘ Greetings , Rabbi ! ’ and kissed him .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	50	Jesus replied , ‘ Do what you came for , friend. ’ [ d ] Then the men stepped forward , seized Jesus and arrested him .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	51	With that , one of Jesus ’ companions reached for his sword , drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest , cutting off his ear .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	52	‘ Put your sword back in its place , ’ Jesus said to him , ‘ for all who draw the sword will die by the sword .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	53	Do you think I can not call on my Father , and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels ?
NIVUK	Matthew	26	54	But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	55	In that hour Jesus said to the crowd , ‘ Am I leading a rebellion , that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me ? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching , and you did not arrest me .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	56	But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled. ’ Then all the disciples deserted him and fled . Jesus before the Sanhedrin
NIVUK	Matthew	26	57	Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest , where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	58	But Peter followed him at a distance , right up to the courtyard of the high priest . He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	59	The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	60	But they did not find any , though many false witnesses came forward . Finally two came forward
NIVUK	Matthew	26	61	and declared , ‘ This fellow said , “ I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days. ” ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	62	Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus , ‘ Are you not going to answer ? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	63	But Jesus remained silent . The high priest said to him , ‘ I charge you under oath by the living God : Tell us if you are the Messiah , the Son of God. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	64	‘ You have said so , ’ Jesus replied . ‘ But I say to all of you : from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven. ’ [ e ]
NIVUK	Matthew	26	65	Then the high priest tore his clothes and said , ‘ He has spoken blasphemy ! Why do we need any more witnesses ? Look , now you have heard the blasphemy .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	66	What do you think ? ’ ‘ He is worthy of death , ’ they answered .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	67	Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists . Others slapped him
NIVUK	Matthew	26	68	and said , ‘ Prophesy to us , Messiah . Who hit you ? ’ Peter disowns Jesus
NIVUK	Matthew	26	69	Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard , and a servant-girl came to him . ‘ You also were with Jesus of Galilee , ’ she said .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	70	But he denied it before them all . ‘ I don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about , ’ he said .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	71	Then he went out to the gateway , where another servant-girl saw him and said to the people there , ‘ This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	72	He denied it again , with an oath : ‘ I don ’ t know the man ! ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	73	After a little while , those standing there went up to Peter and said , ‘ Surely you are one of them ; your accent gives you away. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	26	74	Then he began to call down curses , and he swore to them , ‘ I don ’ t know the man ! ’ Immediately a cock crowed .
NIVUK	Matthew	26	75	Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken : ‘ Before the cock crows , you will disown me three times. ’ And he went outside and wept bitterly .

NIVUK	Matthew	27	27	Then the governor ’ s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers round him .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	2	So they bound him , led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	3	When Judas , who had betrayed him , saw that Jesus was condemned , he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	4	‘ I have sinned , ’ he said , ‘ for I have betrayed innocent blood. ’ ‘ What is that to us ? ’ they replied . ‘ That ’ s your responsibility. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	27	5	So Judas threw the money into the temple and left . Then he went away and hanged himself .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	6	The chief priests picked up the coins and said , ‘ It is against the law to put this into the treasury , since it is blood money. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	27	7	So they decided to use the money to buy the potter ’ s field as a burial place for foreigners .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	8	That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	9	Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled : ‘ They took the thirty pieces of silver , the price set on him by the people of Israel ,
NIVUK	Matthew	27	10	and they used them to buy the potter ’ s field , as the Lord commanded me. ’ [ a ] Jesus before Pilate
NIVUK	Matthew	27	11	Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor , and the governor asked him , ‘ Are you the king of the Jews ? ’ ‘ You have said so , ’ Jesus replied .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	12	When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders , he gave no answer .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	13	Then Pilate asked him , ‘ Don ’ t you hear the testimony they are bringing against you ? ’
NIVUK	Matthew	27	14	But Jesus made no reply , not even to a single charge – to the great amazement of the governor .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	15	Now it was the governor ’ s custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	16	At that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was Jesus [ b ] Barabbas .

NIVUK	Matthew	27	18	For he knew it was out of self-interest that they had handed Jesus over to him .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	19	While Pilate was sitting on the judge ’ s seat , his wife sent him this message : ‘ Don ’ t have anything to do with that innocent man , for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	27	20	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	21	‘ Which of the two do you want me to release to you ? ’ asked the governor . ‘ Barabbas , ’ they answered .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	22	‘ What shall I do , then , with Jesus who is called the Messiah ? ’ Pilate asked . They all answered , ‘ Crucify him ! ’
NIVUK	Matthew	27	23	‘ Why ? What crime has he committed ? ’ asked Pilate . But they shouted all the louder , ‘ Crucify him ! ’
NIVUK	Matthew	27	24	When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere , but that instead an uproar was starting , he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd . ‘ I am innocent of this man ’ s blood , ’ he said . ‘ It is your responsibility ! ’
NIVUK	Matthew	27	25	All the people answered , ‘ His blood is on us and on our children ! ’
NIVUK	Matthew	27	26	Then he released Barabbas to them . But he had Jesus flogged , and handed him over to be crucified . The soldiers mock Jesus
NIVUK	Matthew	27	28	They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him ,
NIVUK	Matthew	27	29	and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head . They put a staff in his right hand . Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him . ‘ Hail , king of the Jews ! ’ they said .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	30	They spat on him , and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	31	After they had mocked him , they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him . Then they led him away to crucify him . The crucifixion of Jesus
NIVUK	Matthew	27	32	As they were going out , they met a man from Cyrene , named Simon , and they forced him to carry the cross .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	33	They came to a place called Golgotha ( which means ‘ the place of the skull ’ ) .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	34	There they offered Jesus wine to drink , mixed with gall ; but after tasting it , he refused to drink it .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	35	When they had crucified him , they divided up his clothes by casting lots .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	36	And sitting down , they kept watch over him there .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	37	Above his head they placed the written charge against him : this is jesus , the king of the jews .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	38	Two rebels were crucified with him , one on his right and one on his left .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	39	Those who passed by hurled insults at him , shaking their heads
NIVUK	Matthew	27	40	and saying , ‘ You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days , save yourself ! Come down from the cross , if you are the Son of God ! ’
NIVUK	Matthew	27	41	In the same way the chief priests , the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	42	‘ He saved others , ’ they said , ‘ but he can ’ t save himself ! He ’ s the king of Israel ! Let him come down now from the cross , and we will believe in him .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	43	He trusts in God . Let God rescue him now if he wants him , for he said , “ I am the Son of God. ” ’
NIVUK	Matthew	27	44	In the same way the rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him . The death of Jesus
NIVUK	Matthew	27	45	From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	46	About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice , ‘ Eli , Eli , [ c ] lema sabachthani ? ’ ( which means ‘ My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? ’ ) . [ d ]
NIVUK	Matthew	27	47	When some of those standing there heard this , they said , ‘ He ’ s calling Elijah. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	27	48	Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge . He filled it with wine vinegar , put it on a staff , and offered it to Jesus to drink .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	49	The rest said , ‘ Now leave him alone . Let ’ s see if Elijah comes to save him. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	27	50	And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice , he gave up his spirit .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	51	At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom . The earth shook , the rocks split
NIVUK	Matthew	27	52	and the tombs broke open . The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	53	They came out of the tombs after Jesus ’ resurrection and [ e ] went into the holy city and appeared to many people .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	54	When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened , they were terrified , and exclaimed , ‘ Surely he was the Son of God ! ’
NIVUK	Matthew	27	55	Many women were there , watching from a distance . They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	56	Among them were Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James and Joseph , [ f ] and the mother of Zebedee ’ s sons . The burial of Jesus
NIVUK	Matthew	27	57	As evening approached , there came a rich man from Arimathea , named Joseph , who had himself become a disciple of Jesus .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	58	Going to Pilate , he asked for Jesus ’ body , and Pilate ordered that it be given to him .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	59	Joseph took the body , wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
NIVUK	Matthew	27	60	and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock . He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	61	Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb . The guard at the tomb
NIVUK	Matthew	27	62	The next day , the one after Preparation Day , the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate .
NIVUK	Matthew	27	63	‘ Sir , ’ they said , ‘ we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said , “ After three days I will rise again. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	27	64	So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day . Otherwise , his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead . This last deception will be worse than the first. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	27	65	‘ Take a guard , ’ Pilate answered . ‘ Go , make the tomb as secure as you know how. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	27	66	So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard . Footnotes - Matthew 27:10 See Zech . 11:12,13 ; Jer . 19:1-13 ; 32:6-9 . - Matthew 27:16 Many manuscripts do not have Jesus ; also in verse

NIVUK	Matthew	28	28	After the Sabbath , at dawn on the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb .
NIVUK	Matthew	28	2	There was a violent earthquake , for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and , going to the tomb , rolled back the stone and sat on it .
NIVUK	Matthew	28	3	His appearance was like lightning , and his clothes were white as snow .
NIVUK	Matthew	28	4	The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men .
NIVUK	Matthew	28	5	The angel said to the women , ‘ Do not be afraid , for I know that you are looking for Jesus , who was crucified .
NIVUK	Matthew	28	6	He is not here ; he has risen , just as he said . Come and see the place where he lay .
NIVUK	Matthew	28	7	Then go quickly and tell his disciples : “ He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee . There you will see him. ” Now I have told you. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	28	8	So the women hurried away from the tomb , afraid yet filled with joy , and ran to tell his disciples .
NIVUK	Matthew	28	9	Suddenly Jesus met them . ‘ Greetings , ’ he said . They came to him , clasped his feet and worshipped him .
NIVUK	Matthew	28	10	Then Jesus said to them , ‘ Do not be afraid . Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee ; there they will see me. ’ The guards ’ report
NIVUK	Matthew	28	11	While the women were on their way , some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened .
NIVUK	Matthew	28	12	When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan , they gave the soldiers a large sum of money ,
NIVUK	Matthew	28	13	telling them , ‘ You are to say , “ His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep. ”
NIVUK	Matthew	28	14	If this report gets to the governor , we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble. ’
NIVUK	Matthew	28	15	So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed . And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day . The great commission
NIVUK	Matthew	28	16	Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee , to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go .
NIVUK	Matthew	28	17	When they saw him , they worshipped him ; but some doubted .
NIVUK	Matthew	28	18	Then Jesus came to them and said , ‘ All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me .
NIVUK	Matthew	28	19	Therefore go and make disciples of all nations , baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit ,
NIVUK	Matthew	28	20	and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you . And surely I am with you always , to the very end of the age. ’ Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Mark	1	1	The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah , [ a ] the Son of God , [ b ]
NIVUK	Mark	1	2	as it is written in Isaiah the prophet : ‘ I will send my messenger ahead of you , who will prepare your way ’ [ c ] –
NIVUK	Mark	1	3	‘ a voice of one calling in the wilderness , “ Prepare the way for the Lord , make straight paths for him. ” ’ [ d ]
NIVUK	Mark	1	4	And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness , preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins .
NIVUK	Mark	1	5	The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him . Confessing their sins , they were baptised by him in the River Jordan .
NIVUK	Mark	1	6	John wore clothing made of camel ’ s hair , with a leather belt round his waist , and he ate locusts and wild honey .
NIVUK	Mark	1	7	And this was his message : ‘ After me comes the one more powerful than I , the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie .
NIVUK	Mark	1	8	I baptise you with [ e ] water , but he will baptise you with [ f ] the Holy Spirit. ’ The baptism and testing of Jesus
NIVUK	Mark	1	9	At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptised by John in the Jordan .
NIVUK	Mark	1	10	Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water , he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove .
NIVUK	Mark	1	11	And a voice came from heaven : ‘ You are my Son , whom I love ; with you I am well pleased. ’
NIVUK	Mark	1	12	At once the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness ,
NIVUK	Mark	1	13	and he was in the wilderness for forty days , being tempted [ g ] by Satan . He was with the wild animals , and angels attended him . Jesus announces the good news
NIVUK	Mark	1	14	After John was put in prison , Jesus went into Galilee , proclaiming the good news of God .
NIVUK	Mark	1	15	‘ The time has come , ’ he said . ‘ The kingdom of God has come near . Repent and believe the good news ! ’ Jesus calls his first disciples
NIVUK	Mark	1	16	As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake , for they were fishermen .
NIVUK	Mark	1	17	‘ Come , follow me , ’ Jesus said , ‘ and I will send you out to fish for people. ’
NIVUK	Mark	1	18	At once they left their nets and followed him .
NIVUK	Mark	1	19	When he had gone a little farther , he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat , preparing their nets .
NIVUK	Mark	1	20	Without delay he called them , and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him . Jesus drives out an impure spirit
NIVUK	Mark	1	21	They went to Capernaum , and when the Sabbath came , Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach .
NIVUK	Mark	1	22	The people were amazed at his teaching , because he taught them as one who had authority , not as the teachers of the law .
NIVUK	Mark	1	23	Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out ,
NIVUK	Mark	1	24	‘ What do you want with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are – the Holy One of God ! ’
NIVUK	Mark	1	25	‘ Be quiet ! ’ said Jesus sternly . ‘ Come out of him ! ’
NIVUK	Mark	1	26	The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek .
NIVUK	Mark	1	27	The people were all so amazed that they asked each other , ‘ What is this ? A new teaching – and with authority ! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him. ’
NIVUK	Mark	1	28	News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee . Jesus heals many
NIVUK	Mark	1	29	As soon as they left the synagogue , they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew .
NIVUK	Mark	1	30	Simon ’ s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever , and they immediately told Jesus about her .
NIVUK	Mark	1	31	So he went to her , took her hand and helped her up . The fever left her and she began to wait on them .
NIVUK	Mark	1	32	That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all who were ill and demon-possessed .
NIVUK	Mark	1	33	The whole town gathered at the door ,
NIVUK	Mark	1	34	and Jesus healed many who had various diseases . He also drove out many demons , but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was . Jesus prays in a solitary place
NIVUK	Mark	1	35	Very early in the morning , while it was still dark , Jesus got up , left the house and went off to a solitary place , where he prayed .
NIVUK	Mark	1	36	Simon and his companions went to look for him ,
NIVUK	Mark	1	37	and when they found him , they exclaimed : ‘ Everyone is looking for you ! ’
NIVUK	Mark	1	38	Jesus replied , ‘ Let us go somewhere else – to the nearby villages – so that I can preach there also . That is why I have come. ’
NIVUK	Mark	1	39	So he travelled throughout Galilee , preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons . Jesus heals a man with leprosy
NIVUK	Mark	1	40	A man with leprosy [ h ] came to him and begged him on his knees , ‘ If you are willing , you can make me clean. ’
NIVUK	Mark	1	41	Jesus was indignant . [ i ] He reached out his hand and touched the man . ‘ I am willing , ’ he said . ‘ Be clean ! ’
NIVUK	Mark	1	42	Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed .
NIVUK	Mark	1	43	Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning :
NIVUK	Mark	1	44	‘ See that you don ’ t tell this to anyone . But go , show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing , as a testimony to them. ’
NIVUK	Mark	1	45	Instead he went out and began to talk freely , spreading the news . As a result , Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places . Yet the people still came to him from everywhere . Footnotes - Mark 1:1 Or Jesus Christ .

NIVUK	Mark	2	2	They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left , not even outside the door , and he preached the word to them .
NIVUK	Mark	2	3	Some men came , bringing to him a paralysed man , carried by four of them .
NIVUK	Mark	2	4	Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd , they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on .
NIVUK	Mark	2	5	When Jesus saw their faith , he said to the paralysed man , ‘ Son , your sins are forgiven. ’
NIVUK	Mark	2	6	Now some teachers of the law were sitting there , thinking to themselves ,
NIVUK	Mark	2	7	‘ Why does this fellow talk like that ? He ’ s blaspheming ! Who can forgive sins but God alone ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	2	8	Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts , and he said to them , ‘ Why are you thinking these things ?
NIVUK	Mark	2	9	Which is easier : to say to this paralysed man , “ Your sins are forgiven , ” or to say , “ Get up , take your mat and walk ” ?
NIVUK	Mark	2	10	But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. ’ So he said to the man ,
NIVUK	Mark	2	11	‘ I tell you , get up , take your mat and go home. ’
NIVUK	Mark	2	12	He got up , took his mat and walked out in full view of them all . This amazed everyone and they praised God , saying , ‘ We have never seen anything like this ! ’ Jesus calls Levi and eats with sinners
NIVUK	Mark	2	13	Once again Jesus went out beside the lake . A large crowd came to him , and he began to teach them .
NIVUK	Mark	2	14	As he walked along , he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector ’ s booth . ‘ Follow me , ’ Jesus told him , and Levi got up and followed him .
NIVUK	Mark	2	15	While Jesus was having dinner at Levi ’ s house , many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples , for there were many who followed him .
NIVUK	Mark	2	16	When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors , they asked his disciples : ‘ Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	2	17	On hearing this , Jesus said to them , ‘ It is not the healthy who need a doctor , but those who are ill . I have not come to call the righteous , but sinners. ’ Jesus questioned about fasting
NIVUK	Mark	2	18	Now John ’ s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting . Some people came and asked Jesus , ‘ How is it that John ’ s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting , but yours are not ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	2	19	Jesus answered , ‘ How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them ? They can not , so long as they have him with them .
NIVUK	Mark	2	20	But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them , and on that day they will fast .
NIVUK	Mark	2	21	‘ No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment . Otherwise , the new piece will pull away from the old , making the tear worse .
NIVUK	Mark	2	22	And no one pours new wine into old wineskins . Otherwise , the wine will burst the skins , and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined . No , they pour new wine into new wineskins. ’ Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath
NIVUK	Mark	2	23	One Sabbath Jesus was going through the cornfields , and as his disciples walked along , they began to pick some ears of corn .
NIVUK	Mark	2	24	The Pharisees said to him , ‘ Look , why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	2	25	He answered , ‘ Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need ?
NIVUK	Mark	2	26	In the days of Abiathar the high priest , he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread , which is lawful only for priests to eat . And he also gave some to his companions. ’
NIVUK	Mark	2	27	Then he said to them , ‘ The Sabbath was made for man , not man for the Sabbath .
NIVUK	Mark	2	28	So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath. ’ Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Mark	3	3	Jesus said to the man with the shrivelled hand , ‘ Stand up in front of everyone. ’
NIVUK	Mark	3	2	Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus , so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath .
NIVUK	Mark	3	4	Then Jesus asked them , ‘ Which is lawful on the Sabbath : to do good or to do evil , to save life or to kill ? ’ But they remained silent .
NIVUK	Mark	3	5	He looked around at them in anger and , deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts , said to the man , ‘ Stretch out your hand. ’ He stretched it out , and his hand was completely restored .
NIVUK	Mark	3	6	Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus . Crowds follow Jesus
NIVUK	Mark	3	7	Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake , and a large crowd from Galilee followed .
NIVUK	Mark	3	8	When they heard all he was doing , many people came to him from Judea , Jerusalem , Idumea , and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon .
NIVUK	Mark	3	9	Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him , to keep the people from crowding him .
NIVUK	Mark	3	10	For he had healed many , so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him .
NIVUK	Mark	3	11	Whenever the impure spirits saw him , they fell down before him and cried out , ‘ You are the Son of God. ’
NIVUK	Mark	3	12	But he gave them strict orders not to tell others about him . Jesus appoints the Twelve
NIVUK	Mark	3	13	Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted , and they came to him .
NIVUK	Mark	3	14	He appointed twelve [ a ] that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach
NIVUK	Mark	3	15	and to have authority to drive out demons .
NIVUK	Mark	3	16	These are the twelve he appointed : Simon ( to whom he gave the name Peter ) ;
NIVUK	Mark	3	17	James son of Zebedee and his brother John ( to them he gave the name Boanerges , which means ‘ sons of thunder ’ ) ,
NIVUK	Mark	3	18	Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , James son of Alphaeus , Thaddaeus , Simon the Zealot
NIVUK	Mark	3	19	and Judas Iscariot , who betrayed him . Jesus accused by his family and by teachers of the law
NIVUK	Mark	3	20	Then Jesus entered a house , and again a crowd gathered , so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat .
NIVUK	Mark	3	21	When his family [ b ] heard about this , they went to take charge of him , for they said , ‘ He is out of his mind. ’
NIVUK	Mark	3	22	And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said , ‘ He is possessed by Beelzebul ! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons. ’
NIVUK	Mark	3	23	So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables : ‘ How can Satan drive out Satan ?
NIVUK	Mark	3	24	If a kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom can not stand .
NIVUK	Mark	3	25	If a house is divided against itself , that house can not stand .
NIVUK	Mark	3	26	And if Satan opposes himself and is divided , he can not stand ; his end has come .
NIVUK	Mark	3	27	In fact , no one can enter a strong man ’ s house without first tying him up . Then he can plunder the strong man ’ s house .
NIVUK	Mark	3	28	Truly I tell you , people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter ,
NIVUK	Mark	3	29	but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven ; they are guilty of an eternal sin. ’
NIVUK	Mark	3	30	He said this because they were saying , ‘ He has an impure spirit. ’
NIVUK	Mark	3	31	Then Jesus ’ mother and brothers arrived . Standing outside , they sent someone in to call him .
NIVUK	Mark	3	32	A crowd was sitting round him , and they told him , ‘ Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you. ’
NIVUK	Mark	3	33	‘ Who are my mother and my brothers ? ’ he asked .
NIVUK	Mark	3	34	Then he looked at those seated in a circle round him and said , ‘ Here are my mother and my brothers !

NIVUK	Mark	4	4	As he was scattering the seed , some fell along the path , and the birds came and ate it up .
NIVUK	Mark	4	2	He taught them many things by parables , and in his teaching said :
NIVUK	Mark	4	3	‘ Listen ! A farmer went out to sow his seed .
NIVUK	Mark	4	5	Some fell on rocky places , where it did not have much soil . It sprang up quickly , because the soil was shallow .
NIVUK	Mark	4	6	But when the sun came up , the plants were scorched , and they withered because they had no root .
NIVUK	Mark	4	7	Other seed fell among thorns , which grew up and choked the plants , so that they did not bear grain .
NIVUK	Mark	4	8	Still other seed fell on good soil . It came up , grew and produced a crop , some multiplying thirty , some sixty , some a hundred times. ’
NIVUK	Mark	4	9	Then Jesus said , ‘ Whoever has ears to hear , let them hear. ’
NIVUK	Mark	4	10	When he was alone , the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables .
NIVUK	Mark	4	11	He told them , ‘ The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you . But to those on the outside everything is said in parables
NIVUK	Mark	4	12	so that , ‘ “ they may be ever seeing but never perceiving , and ever hearing but never understanding ; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven ! ” [ a ] ’
NIVUK	Mark	4	13	Then Jesus said to them , ‘ Don ’ t you understand this parable ? How then will you understand any parable ?
NIVUK	Mark	4	14	The farmer sows the word .
NIVUK	Mark	4	15	Some people are like seed along the path , where the word is sown . As soon as they hear it , Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them .
NIVUK	Mark	4	16	Others , like seed sown on rocky places , hear the word and at once receive it with joy .
NIVUK	Mark	4	17	But since they have no root , they last only a short time . When trouble or persecution comes because of the word , they quickly fall away .
NIVUK	Mark	4	18	Still others , like seed sown among thorns , hear the word ;
NIVUK	Mark	4	19	but the worries of this life , the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word , making it unfruitful .
NIVUK	Mark	4	20	Others , like seed sown on good soil , hear the word , accept it , and produce a crop – some thirty , some sixty , some a hundred times what was sown. ’ A lamp on a stand
NIVUK	Mark	4	21	He said to them , ‘ Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed ? Instead , don ’ t you put it on its stand ?
NIVUK	Mark	4	22	For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed , and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open .
NIVUK	Mark	4	23	If anyone has ears to hear , let them hear. ’
NIVUK	Mark	4	24	‘ Consider carefully what you hear , ’ he continued . ‘ With the measure you use , it will be measured to you – and even more .
NIVUK	Mark	4	25	Whoever has will be given more ; whoever does not have , even what they have will be taken from them. ’ The parable of the growing seed
NIVUK	Mark	4	26	He also said , ‘ This is what the kingdom of God is like . A man scatters seed on the ground .
NIVUK	Mark	4	27	Night and day , whether he sleeps or gets up , the seed sprouts and grows , though he does not know how .
NIVUK	Mark	4	28	All by itself the soil produces corn – first the stalk , then the ear , then the full grain in the ear .
NIVUK	Mark	4	29	As soon as the corn is ripe , he puts the sickle to it , because the harvest has come. ’ The parable of the mustard seed
NIVUK	Mark	4	30	Again he said , ‘ What shall we say the kingdom of God is like , or what parable shall we use to describe it ?
NIVUK	Mark	4	31	It is like a mustard seed , which is the smallest of all seeds on earth .
NIVUK	Mark	4	32	Yet when planted , it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants , with such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade. ’
NIVUK	Mark	4	33	With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them , as much as they could understand .
NIVUK	Mark	4	34	He did not say anything to them without using a parable . But when he was alone with his own disciples , he explained everything . Jesus calms the storm
NIVUK	Mark	4	35	That day when evening came , he said to his disciples , ‘ Let us go over to the other side. ’
NIVUK	Mark	4	36	Leaving the crowd behind , they took him along , just as he was , in the boat . There were also other boats with him .
NIVUK	Mark	4	37	A furious squall came up , and the waves broke over the boat , so that it was nearly swamped .
NIVUK	Mark	4	38	Jesus was in the stern , sleeping on a cushion . The disciples woke him and said to him , ‘ Teacher , don ’ t you care if we drown ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	4	39	He got up , rebuked the wind and said to the waves , ‘ Quiet ! Be still ! ’ Then the wind died down and it was completely calm .
NIVUK	Mark	4	40	He said to his disciples , ‘ Why are you so afraid ? Do you still have no faith ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	4	41	They were terrified and asked each other , ‘ Who is this ? Even the wind and the waves obey him ! ’ Footnotes - Mark 4:12 Isaiah 6:9,10 Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Mark	5	5	Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones .
NIVUK	Mark	5	2	When Jesus got out of the boat , a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him .
NIVUK	Mark	5	3	This man lived in the tombs , and no one could bind him anymore , not even with a chain .
NIVUK	Mark	5	4	For he had often been chained hand and foot , but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet . No one was strong enough to subdue him .
NIVUK	Mark	5	6	When he saw Jesus from a distance , he ran and fell on his knees in front of him .
NIVUK	Mark	5	7	He shouted at the top of his voice , ‘ What do you want with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? In God ’ s name don ’ t torture me ! ’
NIVUK	Mark	5	8	For Jesus had said to him , ‘ Come out of this man , you impure spirit ! ’
NIVUK	Mark	5	9	Then Jesus asked him , ‘ What is your name ? ’ ‘ My name is Legion , ’ he replied , ‘ for we are many. ’
NIVUK	Mark	5	10	And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area .
NIVUK	Mark	5	11	A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside .
NIVUK	Mark	5	12	The demons begged Jesus , ‘ Send us among the pigs ; allow us to go into them. ’
NIVUK	Mark	5	13	He gave them permission , and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs . The herd , about two thousand in number , rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned .
NIVUK	Mark	5	14	Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside , and the people went out to see what had happened .
NIVUK	Mark	5	15	When they came to Jesus , they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons , sitting there , dressed and in his right mind ; and they were afraid .
NIVUK	Mark	5	16	Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man – and told about the pigs as well .
NIVUK	Mark	5	17	Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region .
NIVUK	Mark	5	18	As Jesus was getting into the boat , the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him .
NIVUK	Mark	5	19	Jesus did not let him , but said , ‘ Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you , and how he has had mercy on you. ’
NIVUK	Mark	5	20	So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis [ b ] how much Jesus had done for him . And all the people were amazed . Jesus raises a dead girl and heals a sick woman
NIVUK	Mark	5	21	When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake , a large crowd gathered round him while he was by the lake .
NIVUK	Mark	5	22	Then one of the synagogue leaders , named Jairus , came , and when he saw Jesus , he fell at his feet .
NIVUK	Mark	5	23	He pleaded earnestly with him , ‘ My little daughter is dying . Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live. ’
NIVUK	Mark	5	24	So Jesus went with him . A large crowd followed and pressed round him .
NIVUK	Mark	5	25	And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years .
NIVUK	Mark	5	26	She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had , yet instead of getting better she grew worse .
NIVUK	Mark	5	27	When she heard about Jesus , she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak ,
NIVUK	Mark	5	28	because she thought , ‘ If I just touch his clothes , I will be healed. ’
NIVUK	Mark	5	29	Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering .
NIVUK	Mark	5	30	At once Jesus realised that power had gone out from him . He turned round in the crowd and asked , ‘ Who touched my clothes ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	5	31	‘ You see the people crowding against you , ’ his disciples answered , ‘ and yet you can ask , “ Who touched me ? ” ’
NIVUK	Mark	5	32	But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it .
NIVUK	Mark	5	33	Then the woman , knowing what had happened to her , came and fell at his feet and , trembling with fear , told him the whole truth .
NIVUK	Mark	5	34	He said to her , ‘ Daughter , your faith has healed you . Go in peace and be freed from your suffering. ’
NIVUK	Mark	5	35	While Jesus was still speaking , some people came from the house of Jairus , the synagogue leader . ‘ Your daughter is dead , ’ they said . ‘ Why bother the teacher anymore ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	5	36	Overhearing [ c ] what they said , Jesus told him , ‘ Don ’ t be afraid ; just believe. ’
NIVUK	Mark	5	37	He did not let anyone follow him except Peter , James and John the brother of James .
NIVUK	Mark	5	38	When they came to the home of the synagogue leader , Jesus saw a commotion , with people crying and wailing loudly .
NIVUK	Mark	5	39	He went in and said to them , ‘ Why all this commotion and wailing ? The child is not dead but asleep. ’
NIVUK	Mark	5	40	But they laughed at him . After he put them all out , he took the child ’ s father and mother and the disciples who were with him , and went in where the child was .
NIVUK	Mark	5	41	He took her by the hand and said to her , ‘ Talitha koum ! ’ ( which means ‘ Little girl , I say to you , get up ! ’ ) .
NIVUK	Mark	5	42	Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around ( she was twelve years old ) . At this they were completely astonished .
NIVUK	Mark	5	43	He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this , and told them to give her something to eat . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Mark	6	6	He was amazed at their lack of faith . Jesus sends out the Twelve Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village .
NIVUK	Mark	6	2	When the Sabbath came , he began to teach in the synagogue , and many who heard him were amazed . ‘ Where did this man get these things ? ’ they asked . ‘ What ’ s this wisdom that has been given him ? What are these remarkable miracles he is performing ?
NIVUK	Mark	6	3	Isn ’ t this the carpenter ? Isn ’ t this Mary ’ s son and the brother of James , Joseph , [ a ] Judas and Simon ? Aren ’ t his sisters here with us ? ’ And they took offence at him .
NIVUK	Mark	6	4	Jesus said to them , ‘ A prophet is not without honour except in his own town , among his relatives and in his own home. ’
NIVUK	Mark	6	5	He could not do any miracles there , except lay his hands on a few people who were ill and heal them .
NIVUK	Mark	6	7	Calling the Twelve to him , he began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over impure spirits .
NIVUK	Mark	6	8	These were his instructions : ‘ Take nothing for the journey except a staff – no bread , no bag , no money in your belts .
NIVUK	Mark	6	9	Wear sandals but not an extra shirt .
NIVUK	Mark	6	10	Whenever you enter a house , stay there until you leave that town .
NIVUK	Mark	6	11	And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you , leave that place and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them. ’
NIVUK	Mark	6	12	They went out and preached that people should repent .
NIVUK	Mark	6	13	They drove out many demons and anointed with oil many people who were ill and healed them . John the Baptist beheaded
NIVUK	Mark	6	14	King Herod heard about this , for Jesus ’ name had become well known . Some were saying , [ b ] ‘ John the Baptist has been raised from the dead , and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him. ’
NIVUK	Mark	6	15	Others said , ‘ He is Elijah. ’ And still others claimed , ‘ He is a prophet , like one of the prophets of long ago. ’
NIVUK	Mark	6	16	But when Herod heard this , he said , ‘ John , whom I beheaded , has been raised from the dead ! ’
NIVUK	Mark	6	17	For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested , and he had him bound and put in prison . He did this because of Herodias , his brother Philip ’ s wife , whom he had married .
NIVUK	Mark	6	18	For John had been saying to Herod , ‘ It is not lawful for you to have your brother ’ s wife. ’
NIVUK	Mark	6	19	So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him . But she was not able to ,
NIVUK	Mark	6	20	because Herod feared John and protected him , knowing him to be a righteous and holy man . When Herod heard John , he was greatly puzzled [ c ] ; yet he liked to listen to him .
NIVUK	Mark	6	21	Finally the opportune time came . On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee .
NIVUK	Mark	6	22	When the daughter of [ d ] Herodias came in and danced , she pleased Herod and his dinner guests . The king said to the girl , ‘ Ask me for anything you want , and I ’ ll give it to you. ’
NIVUK	Mark	6	23	And he promised her with an oath , ‘ Whatever you ask I will give you , up to half my kingdom. ’
NIVUK	Mark	6	24	She went out and said to her mother , ‘ What shall I ask for ? ’ ‘ The head of John the Baptist , ’ she answered .
NIVUK	Mark	6	25	At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request : ‘ I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a dish. ’
NIVUK	Mark	6	26	The king was greatly distressed , but because of his oaths and his dinner guests , he did not want to refuse her .
NIVUK	Mark	6	27	So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John ’ s head . The man went , beheaded John in the prison ,
NIVUK	Mark	6	28	and brought back his head on a dish . He presented it to the girl , and she gave it to her mother .
NIVUK	Mark	6	29	On hearing of this , John ’ s disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb . Jesus feeds the five thousand
NIVUK	Mark	6	30	The apostles gathered round Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught .
NIVUK	Mark	6	31	Then , because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat , he said to them , ‘ Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest. ’
NIVUK	Mark	6	32	So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place .
NIVUK	Mark	6	33	But many who saw them leaving recognised them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them .
NIVUK	Mark	6	34	When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd , he had compassion on them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd . So he began teaching them many things .
NIVUK	Mark	6	35	By this time it was late in the day , so his disciples came to him . ‘ This is a remote place , ’ they said , ‘ and it ’ s already very late .
NIVUK	Mark	6	36	Send the people away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat. ’
NIVUK	Mark	6	37	But he answered , ‘ You give them something to eat. ’ They said to him , ‘ That would take more than half a year ’ s wages [ e ] ! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	6	38	‘ How many loaves do you have ? ’ he asked . ‘ Go and see. ’ When they found out , they said , ‘ Five – and two fish. ’
NIVUK	Mark	6	39	Then Jesus told them to make all the people sit down in groups on the green grass .
NIVUK	Mark	6	40	So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties .
NIVUK	Mark	6	41	Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven , he gave thanks and broke the loaves . Then he gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people . He also divided the two fish among them all .
NIVUK	Mark	6	42	They all ate and were satisfied ,
NIVUK	Mark	6	43	and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish .
NIVUK	Mark	6	44	The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand . Jesus walks on the water
NIVUK	Mark	6	45	Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida , while he dismissed the crowd .
NIVUK	Mark	6	46	After leaving them , he went up on a mountainside to pray .
NIVUK	Mark	6	47	Later that night , the boat was in the middle of the lake , and he was alone on land .
NIVUK	Mark	6	48	He saw the disciples straining at the oars , because the wind was against them . Shortly before dawn he went out to them , walking on the lake . He was about to pass by them ,
NIVUK	Mark	6	49	but when they saw him walking on the lake , they thought he was a ghost . They cried out ,
NIVUK	Mark	6	50	because they all saw him and were terrified . Immediately he spoke to them and said , ‘ Take courage ! It is I. Don ’ t be afraid. ’
NIVUK	Mark	6	51	Then he climbed into the boat with them , and the wind died down . They were completely amazed ,
NIVUK	Mark	6	52	for they had not understood about the loaves ; their hearts were hardened .
NIVUK	Mark	6	53	When they had crossed over , they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there .
NIVUK	Mark	6	54	As soon as they got out of the boat , people recognised Jesus .
NIVUK	Mark	6	55	They ran throughout that whole region and carried those who were ill on mats to wherever they heard he was .
NIVUK	Mark	6	56	And wherever he went – into villages , towns or countryside – they placed those who were ill in the market-places . They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak , and all who touched it were healed . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Mark	7	7	They worship me in vain ; their teachings are merely human rules. ” [ b ]
NIVUK	Mark	7	2	and saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were defiled , that is , unwashed .
NIVUK	Mark	7	3	( The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing , holding to the tradition of the elders .
NIVUK	Mark	7	4	When they come from the market-place they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions , such as the washing of cups , pitchers and kettles . [ a ] )
NIVUK	Mark	7	5	So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus , ‘ Why don ’ t your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with defiled hands ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	7	6	He replied , ‘ Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites ; as it is written : ‘ “ These people honour me with their lips , but their hearts are far from me .
NIVUK	Mark	7	8	You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions. ’
NIVUK	Mark	7	9	And he continued , ‘ You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe [ c ] your own traditions !
NIVUK	Mark	7	10	For Moses said , “ Honour your father and mother , ” [ d ] and , “ Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death. ” [ e ]
NIVUK	Mark	7	11	But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is Corban ( that is , devoted to God ) –
NIVUK	Mark	7	12	then you no longer let them do anything for their father or mother .
NIVUK	Mark	7	13	Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down . And you do many things like that. ’
NIVUK	Mark	7	14	Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said , ‘ Listen to me , everyone , and understand this .
NIVUK	Mark	7	15	Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them . Rather , it is what comes out of a person that defiles them. ’
NIVUK	Mark	7	17	After he had left the crowd and entered the house , his disciples asked him about this parable .
NIVUK	Mark	7	18	‘ Are you so dull ? ’ he asked . ‘ Don ’ t you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them ?
NIVUK	Mark	7	19	For it doesn ’ t go into their heart but into their stomach , and then out of the body. ’ ( In saying this , Jesus declared all foods clean . )
NIVUK	Mark	7	20	He went on : ‘ What comes out of a person is what defiles them .
NIVUK	Mark	7	21	For it is from within , out of a person ’ s heart , that evil thoughts come – sexual immorality , theft , murder ,
NIVUK	Mark	7	22	adultery , greed , malice , deceit , lewdness , envy , slander , arrogance and folly .
NIVUK	Mark	7	23	All these evils come from inside and defile a person. ’ Jesus honours a Syro-Phoenician woman ’ s faith
NIVUK	Mark	7	24	Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre . [ g ] He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it ; yet he could not keep his presence secret .
NIVUK	Mark	7	25	In fact , as soon as she heard about him , a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure spirit came and fell at his feet .
NIVUK	Mark	7	26	The woman was a Greek , born in Syrian Phoenicia . She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter .
NIVUK	Mark	7	27	‘ First let the children eat all they want , ’ he told her , ‘ for it is not right to take the children ’ s bread and toss it to the dogs. ’
NIVUK	Mark	7	28	‘ Lord , ’ she replied , ‘ even the dogs under the table eat the children ’ s crumbs. ’
NIVUK	Mark	7	29	Then he told her , ‘ For such a reply , you may go ; the demon has left your daughter. ’
NIVUK	Mark	7	30	She went home and found her child lying on the bed , and the demon gone . Jesus heals a deaf and mute man
NIVUK	Mark	7	31	Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon , down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis . [ h ]
NIVUK	Mark	7	32	There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk , and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him .
NIVUK	Mark	7	33	After he took him aside , away from the crowd , Jesus put his fingers into the man ’ s ears . Then he spat and touched the man ’ s tongue .
NIVUK	Mark	7	34	He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him , ‘ Ephphatha ! ’ ( which means ‘ Be opened ! ’ ) .
NIVUK	Mark	7	35	At this , the man ’ s ears were opened , his tongue was loosed and he began to speak plainly .
NIVUK	Mark	7	36	Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone . But the more he did so , the more they kept talking about it .
NIVUK	Mark	7	37	People were overwhelmed with amazement . ‘ He has done everything well , ’ they said . ‘ He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak. ’ Footnotes - Mark 7:4 Some early manuscripts pitchers , kettles and dining couches - Mark 7:7 Isaiah 29:13 - Mark 7:9 Some manuscripts set up - Mark 7:10 Exodus 20:12 ; Deut . 5:16 - Mark 7:10 Exodus 21:17 ; Lev . 20:9 - Mark 7:16 Some manuscripts include here the words of 4:23 . - Mark 7:24 Many early manuscripts Tyre and Sidon - Mark 7:31 That is , the Ten Cities Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Mark	8	2	‘ I have compassion for these people ; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat .
NIVUK	Mark	8	3	If I send them home hungry , they will collapse on the way , because some of them have come a long distance. ’
NIVUK	Mark	8	4	His disciples answered , ‘ But where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	8	5	‘ How many loaves do you have ? ’ Jesus asked . ‘ Seven , ’ they replied .
NIVUK	Mark	8	6	He told the crowd to sit down on the ground . When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks , he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people , and they did so .
NIVUK	Mark	8	7	They had a few small fish as well ; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them .
NIVUK	Mark	8	9	About four thousand were present . After he had sent them away ,
NIVUK	Mark	8	10	he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha .
NIVUK	Mark	8	11	The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus . To test him , they asked him for a sign from heaven .
NIVUK	Mark	8	12	He sighed deeply and said , ‘ Why does this generation ask for a sign ? Truly I tell you , no sign will be given to it. ’
NIVUK	Mark	8	13	Then he left them , got back into the boat and crossed to the other side . The yeast of the Pharisees and Herod
NIVUK	Mark	8	14	The disciples had forgotten to bring bread , except for one loaf they had with them in the boat .
NIVUK	Mark	8	15	‘ Be careful , ’ Jesus warned them . ‘ Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod. ’
NIVUK	Mark	8	16	They discussed this with one another and said , ‘ It is because we have no bread. ’
NIVUK	Mark	8	17	Aware of their discussion , Jesus asked them : ‘ Why are you talking about having no bread ? Do you still not see or understand ? Are your hearts hardened ?
NIVUK	Mark	8	18	Do you have eyes but fail to see , and ears but fail to hear ? And don ’ t you remember ?
NIVUK	Mark	8	19	When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand , how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up ? ’ ‘ Twelve , ’ they replied .
NIVUK	Mark	8	20	‘ And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand , how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up ? ’ They answered , ‘ Seven. ’

NIVUK	Mark	8	23	He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village . When he had spat on the man ’ s eyes and put his hands on him , Jesus asked , ‘ Do you see anything ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	8	24	He looked up and said , ‘ I see people ; they look like trees walking around. ’
NIVUK	Mark	8	25	Once more Jesus put his hands on the man ’ s eyes . Then his eyes were opened , his sight was restored , and he saw everything clearly .
NIVUK	Mark	8	26	Jesus sent him home , saying , ‘ Don ’ t even go into [ a ] the village. ’ Peter declares that Jesus is the Messiah
NIVUK	Mark	8	27	Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi . On the way he asked them , ‘ Who do people say I am ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	8	28	They replied , ‘ Some say John the Baptist ; others say Elijah ; and still others , one of the prophets. ’
NIVUK	Mark	8	29	‘ But what about you ? ’ he asked . ‘ Who do you say I am ? ’ Peter answered , ‘ You are the Messiah. ’
NIVUK	Mark	8	30	Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him . Jesus predicts his death
NIVUK	Mark	8	31	He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders , the chief priests and the teachers of the law , and that he must be killed and after three days rise again .
NIVUK	Mark	8	32	He spoke plainly about this , and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him .
NIVUK	Mark	8	33	But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples , he rebuked Peter . ‘ Get behind me , Satan ! ’ he said . ‘ You do not have in mind the concerns of God , but merely human concerns. ’ The way of the cross
NIVUK	Mark	8	34	Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said : ‘ Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me .
NIVUK	Mark	8	35	For whoever wants to save their life [ b ] will lose it , but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it .
NIVUK	Mark	8	36	What good is it for someone to gain the whole world , yet forfeit their soul ?
NIVUK	Mark	8	37	Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul ?

NIVUK	Mark	9	9	As they were coming down the mountain , Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
NIVUK	Mark	9	2	After six days Jesus took Peter , James and John with him and led them up a high mountain , where they were all alone . There he was transfigured before them .
NIVUK	Mark	9	3	His clothes became dazzling white , whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them .
NIVUK	Mark	9	4	And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses , who were talking with Jesus .
NIVUK	Mark	9	5	Peter said to Jesus , ‘ Rabbi , it is good for us to be here . Let us put up three shelters – one for you , one for Moses and one for Elijah. ’
NIVUK	Mark	9	6	( He did not know what to say , they were so frightened . )
NIVUK	Mark	9	7	Then a cloud appeared and covered them , and a voice came from the cloud : ‘ This is my Son , whom I love . Listen to him ! ’
NIVUK	Mark	9	8	Suddenly , when they looked around , they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus .
NIVUK	Mark	9	10	They kept the matter to themselves , discussing what ‘ rising from the dead ’ meant .
NIVUK	Mark	9	11	And they asked him , ‘ Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	9	12	Jesus replied , ‘ To be sure , Elijah does come first , and restores all things . Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected ?
NIVUK	Mark	9	13	But I tell you , Elijah has come , and they have done to him everything they wished , just as it is written about him. ’ Jesus heals a boy possessed by an impure spirit
NIVUK	Mark	9	14	When they came to the other disciples , they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them .
NIVUK	Mark	9	15	As soon as all the people saw Jesus , they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him .
NIVUK	Mark	9	16	‘ What are you arguing with them about ? ’ he asked .
NIVUK	Mark	9	17	A man in the crowd answered , ‘ Teacher , I brought you my son , who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech .
NIVUK	Mark	9	18	Whenever it seizes him , it throws him to the ground . He foams at the mouth , gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid . I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit , but they could not. ’
NIVUK	Mark	9	19	‘ You unbelieving generation , ’ Jesus replied , ‘ how long shall I stay with you ? How long shall I put up with you ? Bring the boy to me. ’
NIVUK	Mark	9	20	So they brought him . When the spirit saw Jesus , it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion . He fell to the ground and rolled around , foaming at the mouth .
NIVUK	Mark	9	21	Jesus asked the boy ’ s father , ‘ How long has he been like this ? ’ ‘ From childhood , ’ he answered .
NIVUK	Mark	9	22	‘ It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him . But if you can do anything , take pity on us and help us. ’
NIVUK	Mark	9	23	‘ “ If you can ” ? ’ said Jesus . ‘ Everything is possible for one who believes. ’
NIVUK	Mark	9	24	Immediately the boy ’ s father exclaimed , ‘ I do believe ; help me overcome my unbelief ! ’
NIVUK	Mark	9	25	When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene , he rebuked the impure spirit . ‘ You deaf and mute spirit , ’ he said , ‘ I command you , come out of him and never enter him again. ’
NIVUK	Mark	9	26	The spirit shrieked , convulsed him violently and came out . The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said , ‘ He ’ s dead. ’
NIVUK	Mark	9	27	But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet , and he stood up .
NIVUK	Mark	9	28	After Jesus had gone indoors , his disciples asked him privately , ‘ Why couldn ’ t we drive it out ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	9	29	He replied , ‘ This kind can come out only by prayer . [ a ] ’ Jesus predicts his death a second time
NIVUK	Mark	9	30	They left that place and passed through Galilee . Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were ,
NIVUK	Mark	9	31	because he was teaching his disciples . He said to them , ‘ The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men . They will kill him , and after three days he will rise. ’
NIVUK	Mark	9	32	But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it .
NIVUK	Mark	9	33	They came to Capernaum . When he was in the house , he asked them , ‘ What were you arguing about on the road ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	9	34	But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest .
NIVUK	Mark	9	35	Sitting down , Jesus called the Twelve and said , ‘ Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last , and the servant of all. ’
NIVUK	Mark	9	36	He took a little child whom he placed among them . Taking the child in his arms , he said to them ,
NIVUK	Mark	9	37	‘ Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me ; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me. ’ Whoever is not against us is for us
NIVUK	Mark	9	38	‘ Teacher , ’ said John , ‘ we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop , because he was not one of us. ’
NIVUK	Mark	9	39	‘ Do not stop him , ’ Jesus said . ‘ For no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me ,
NIVUK	Mark	9	40	for whoever is not against us is for us .
NIVUK	Mark	9	41	Truly I tell you , anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to the Messiah will certainly not lose their reward . Causing to stumble
NIVUK	Mark	9	42	‘ If anyone causes one of these little ones – those who believe in me – to stumble , it would be better for them if a large millstone were hung round their neck and they were thrown into the sea .
NIVUK	Mark	9	43	If your hand causes you to stumble , cut it off . It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell , where the fire never goes out . ‘ “ the worms that eat them do not die , and the fire is not quenched. ” [ d ]
NIVUK	Mark	9	49	Everyone will be salted with fire .

NIVUK	Mark	10	10	When they were in the house again , the disciples asked Jesus about this .
NIVUK	Mark	10	2	Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking , ‘ Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	3	‘ What did Moses command you ? ’ he replied .
NIVUK	Mark	10	4	They said , ‘ Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away. ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	5	‘ It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law , ’ Jesus replied .
NIVUK	Mark	10	6	‘ But at the beginning of creation God “ made them male and female ” . [ a ]
NIVUK	Mark	10	7	“ For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife , [ b ]
NIVUK	Mark	10	8	and the two will become one flesh. ” [ c ] So they are no longer two , but one flesh .
NIVUK	Mark	10	9	Therefore what God has joined together , let no one separate. ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	11	He answered , ‘ Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her .
NIVUK	Mark	10	12	And if she divorces her husband and marries another man , she commits adultery. ’ The little children and Jesus
NIVUK	Mark	10	13	People were bringing little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them , but the disciples rebuked them .
NIVUK	Mark	10	14	When Jesus saw this , he was indignant . He said to them , ‘ Let the little children come to me , and do not hinder them , for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
NIVUK	Mark	10	15	Truly I tell you , anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it. ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	16	And he took the children in his arms , placed his hands on them and blessed them . The rich and the kingdom of God
NIVUK	Mark	10	17	As Jesus started on his way , a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him . ‘ Good teacher , ’ he asked , ‘ what must I do to inherit eternal life ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	18	‘ Why do you call me good ? ’ Jesus answered . ‘ No one is good – except God alone .
NIVUK	Mark	10	19	You know the commandments : “ You shall not murder , you shall not commit adultery , you shall not steal , you shall not give false testimony , you shall not defraud , honour your father and mother. ” [ d ] ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	20	‘ Teacher , ’ he declared , ‘ all these I have kept since I was a boy. ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	21	Jesus looked at him and loved him . ‘ One thing you lack , ’ he said . ‘ Go , sell everything you have and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come , follow me. ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	22	At this the man ’ s face fell . He went away sad , because he had great wealth .
NIVUK	Mark	10	23	Jesus looked round and said to his disciples , ‘ How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God ! ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	24	The disciples were amazed at his words . But Jesus said again , ‘ Children , how hard it is [ e ] to enter the kingdom of God !
NIVUK	Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God. ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	26	The disciples were even more amazed , and said to each other , ‘ Who then can be saved ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	27	Jesus looked at them and said , ‘ With man this is impossible , but not with God ; all things are possible with God. ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	28	Then Peter spoke up , ‘ We have left everything to follow you ! ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	29	‘ Truly I tell you , ’ Jesus replied , ‘ no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel
NIVUK	Mark	10	30	will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age : homes , brothers , sisters , mothers , children and fields – along with persecutions – and in the age to come eternal life .
NIVUK	Mark	10	31	But many who are first will be last , and the last first. ’ Jesus predicts his death a third time
NIVUK	Mark	10	32	They were on their way up to Jerusalem , with Jesus leading the way , and the disciples were astonished , while those who followed were afraid . Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him .
NIVUK	Mark	10	33	‘ We are going up to Jerusalem , ’ he said , ‘ and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law . They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles ,
NIVUK	Mark	10	34	who will mock him and spit on him , flog him and kill him . Three days later he will rise. ’ The request of James and John
NIVUK	Mark	10	35	Then James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came to him . ‘ Teacher , ’ they said , ‘ we want you to do for us whatever we ask. ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	36	‘ What do you want me to do for you ? ’ he asked .
NIVUK	Mark	10	37	They replied , ‘ Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory. ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	38	‘ You don ’ t know what you are asking , ’ Jesus said . ‘ Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptised with the baptism I am baptised with ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	39	‘ We can , ’ they answered . Jesus said to them , ‘ You will drink the cup I drink and be baptised with the baptism I am baptised with ,
NIVUK	Mark	10	40	but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant . These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared. ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	41	When the ten heard about this , they became indignant with James and John .
NIVUK	Mark	10	42	Jesus called them together and said , ‘ You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them , and their high officials exercise authority over them .
NIVUK	Mark	10	43	Not so with you . Instead , whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant ,
NIVUK	Mark	10	44	and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all .
NIVUK	Mark	10	45	For even the Son of Man did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give his life as a ransom for many. ’ Blind Bartimaeus receives his sight
NIVUK	Mark	10	46	Then they came to Jericho . As Jesus and his disciples , together with a large crowd , were leaving the city , a blind man , Bartimaeus ( which means ‘ son of Timaeus ’ ) , was sitting by the roadside begging .
NIVUK	Mark	10	47	When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to shout , ‘ Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	48	Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet , but he shouted all the more , ‘ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	49	Jesus stopped and said , ‘ Call him. ’ So they called to the blind man , ‘ Cheer up ! On your feet ! He ’ s calling you. ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	50	Throwing his cloak aside , he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus .
NIVUK	Mark	10	51	‘ What do you want me to do for you ? ’ Jesus asked him . The blind man said , ‘ Rabbi , I want to see. ’
NIVUK	Mark	10	52	‘ Go , ’ said Jesus , ‘ your faith has healed you. ’ Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road .

NIVUK	Mark	11	11	Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts . He looked around at everything , but since it was already late , he went out to Bethany with the Twelve . Jesus curses a fig-tree and clears the temple courts
NIVUK	Mark	11	2	saying to them , ‘ Go to the village ahead of you , and just as you enter it , you will find a colt tied there , which no one has ever ridden . Untie it and bring it here .
NIVUK	Mark	11	3	If anyone asks you , “ Why are you doing this ? ” say , “ The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly. ” ’
NIVUK	Mark	11	4	They went and found a colt outside in the street , tied at a doorway . As they untied it ,
NIVUK	Mark	11	5	some people standing there asked , ‘ What are you doing , untying that colt ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	11	6	They answered as Jesus had told them to , and the people let them go .
NIVUK	Mark	11	7	When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it , he sat on it .
NIVUK	Mark	11	8	Many people spread their cloaks on the road , while others spread branches they had cut in the fields .

NIVUK	Mark	11	12	The next day as they were leaving Bethany , Jesus was hungry .
NIVUK	Mark	11	13	Seeing in the distance a fig-tree in leaf , he went to find out if it had any fruit . When he reached it , he found nothing but leaves , because it was not the season for figs .
NIVUK	Mark	11	14	Then he said to the tree , ‘ May no one ever eat fruit from you again. ’ And his disciples heard him say it .
NIVUK	Mark	11	15	On reaching Jerusalem , Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there . He overturned the tables of the money-changers and the benches of those selling doves ,
NIVUK	Mark	11	16	and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts .
NIVUK	Mark	11	17	And as he taught them , he said , ‘ Is it not written : “ My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations ” [ c ] ? But you have made it “ a den of robbers ” . [ d ] ’
NIVUK	Mark	11	18	The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him , for they feared him , because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching .
NIVUK	Mark	11	19	When evening came , Jesus and his disciples [ e ] went out of the city .
NIVUK	Mark	11	20	In the morning , as they went along , they saw the fig-tree withered from the roots .
NIVUK	Mark	11	21	Peter remembered and said to Jesus , ‘ Rabbi , look ! The fig-tree you cursed has withered ! ’

NIVUK	Mark	11	27	They arrived again in Jerusalem , and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts , the chief priests , the teachers of the law and the elders came to him .
NIVUK	Mark	11	28	‘ By what authority are you doing these things ? ’ they asked . ‘ And who gave you authority to do this ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	11	29	Jesus replied , ‘ I will ask you one question . Answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things .
NIVUK	Mark	11	30	John ’ s baptism – was it from heaven , or of human origin ? Tell me ! ’
NIVUK	Mark	11	31	They discussed it among themselves and said , ‘ If we say , “ From heaven , ” he will ask , “ Then why didn ’ t you believe him ? ”
NIVUK	Mark	11	32	But if we say , “ Of human origin ” . . . ’ ( They feared the people , for everyone held that John really was a prophet . )

NIVUK	Mark	12	2	At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard .
NIVUK	Mark	12	3	But they seized him , beat him and sent him away empty-handed .
NIVUK	Mark	12	4	Then he sent another servant to them ; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully .
NIVUK	Mark	12	5	He sent still another , and that one they killed . He sent many others ; some of them they beat , others they killed .
NIVUK	Mark	12	6	‘ He had one left to send , a son , whom he loved . He sent him last of all , saying , “ They will respect my son. ”
NIVUK	Mark	12	7	‘ But the tenants said to one another , “ This is the heir . Come , let ’ s kill him , and the inheritance will be ours. ”
NIVUK	Mark	12	8	So they took him and killed him , and threw him out of the vineyard .
NIVUK	Mark	12	9	‘ What then will the owner of the vineyard do ? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others .
NIVUK	Mark	12	10	Haven ’ t you read this passage of Scripture : ‘ “ The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ;

NIVUK	Mark	12	13	Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words .
NIVUK	Mark	12	14	They came to him and said , ‘ Teacher , we know that you are a man of integrity . You aren ’ t swayed by others , because you pay no attention to who they are ; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth . Is it right to pay the poll-tax [ b ] to Caesar or not ?
NIVUK	Mark	12	15	Should we pay or shouldn ’ t we ? ’ But Jesus knew their hypocrisy . ‘ Why are you trying to trap me ? ’ he asked . ‘ Bring me a denarius and let me look at it. ’
NIVUK	Mark	12	16	They brought the coin , and he asked them , ‘ Whose image is this ? And whose inscription ? ’ ‘ Caesar ’ s , ’ they replied .
NIVUK	Mark	12	17	Then Jesus said to them , ‘ Give back to Caesar what is Caesar ’ s and to God what is God ’ s. ’ And they were amazed at him . Marriage at the resurrection
NIVUK	Mark	12	18	Then the Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection , came to him with a question .
NIVUK	Mark	12	19	‘ Teacher , ’ they said , ‘ Moses wrote for us that if a man ’ s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children , the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother .
NIVUK	Mark	12	20	Now there were seven brothers . The first one married and died without leaving any children .
NIVUK	Mark	12	21	The second one married the widow , but he also died , leaving no child . It was the same with the third .
NIVUK	Mark	12	22	In fact , none of the seven left any children . Last of all , the woman died too .
NIVUK	Mark	12	23	At the resurrection [ c ] whose wife will she be , since the seven were married to her ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	12	24	Jesus replied , ‘ Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God ?
NIVUK	Mark	12	25	When the dead rise , they will neither marry nor be given in marriage ; they will be like the angels in heaven .
NIVUK	Mark	12	26	Now about the dead rising – have you not read in the Book of Moses , in the account of the burning bush , how God said to him , “ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ” [ d ] ?
NIVUK	Mark	12	27	He is not the God of the dead , but of the living . You are badly mistaken ! ’ The greatest commandment
NIVUK	Mark	12	28	One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating . Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer , he asked him , ‘ Of all the commandments , which is the most important ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	12	29	‘ The most important one , ’ answered Jesus , ‘ is this : “ Hear , O Israel : the Lord our God , the Lord is one . [ e ]
NIVUK	Mark	12	30	Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. ” [ f ]
NIVUK	Mark	12	31	The second is this : “ Love your neighbour as yourself. ” [ g ] There is no commandment greater than these. ’
NIVUK	Mark	12	32	‘ Well said , teacher , ’ the man replied . ‘ You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him .
NIVUK	Mark	12	33	To love him with all your heart , with all your understanding and with all your strength , and to love your neighbour as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices. ’
NIVUK	Mark	12	34	When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely , he said to him , ‘ You are not far from the kingdom of God. ’ And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions . Whose son is the Messiah ?
NIVUK	Mark	12	35	While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts , he asked , ‘ Why do the teachers of the law say that the Messiah is the son of David ?
NIVUK	Mark	12	36	David himself , speaking by the Holy Spirit , declared : ‘ “ The Lord said to my Lord : ‘ Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet. ’ ” [ h ]
NIVUK	Mark	12	37	David himself calls him “ Lord ” . How then can he be his son ? ’ The large crowd listened to him with delight . Warning against the teachers of the law
NIVUK	Mark	12	38	As he taught , Jesus said , ‘ Watch out for the teachers of the law . They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the market-places ,
NIVUK	Mark	12	39	and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honour at banquets .
NIVUK	Mark	12	40	They devour widows ’ houses and for a show make lengthy prayers . These men will be punished most severely. ’ The widow ’ s offering
NIVUK	Mark	12	41	Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury . Many rich people threw in large amounts .

NIVUK	Mark	13	2	‘ Do you see all these great buildings ? ’ replied Jesus . ‘ Not one stone here will be left on another ; every one will be thrown down. ’
NIVUK	Mark	13	3	As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple , Peter , James , John and Andrew asked him privately ,
NIVUK	Mark	13	4	‘ Tell us , when will these things happen ? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	13	5	Jesus said to them : ‘ Watch out that no one deceives you .

NIVUK	Mark	13	20	‘ If the Lord had not cut short those days , no one would survive . But for the sake of the elect , whom he has chosen , he has shortened them .
NIVUK	Mark	13	21	At that time if anyone says to you , “ Look , here is the Messiah ! ” or , “ Look , there he is ! ” do not believe it .

NIVUK	Mark	14	3	While he was in Bethany , reclining at the table in the home of Simon the Leper , a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume , made of pure nard . She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head .

NIVUK	Mark	14	20	‘ It is one of the Twelve , ’ he replied , ‘ one who dips bread into the bowl with me .
NIVUK	Mark	14	21	The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him . But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man ! It would be better for him if he had not been born. ’
NIVUK	Mark	14	22	While they were eating , Jesus took bread , and when he had given thanks , he broke it and gave it to his disciples , saying , ‘ Take it ; this is my body. ’

NIVUK	Mark	14	28	But after I have risen , I will go ahead of you into Galilee. ’
NIVUK	Mark	14	29	Peter declared , ‘ Even if all fall away , I will not. ’
NIVUK	Mark	14	30	‘ Truly I tell you , ’ Jesus answered , ‘ today – yes , tonight – before the cock crows twice [ e ] you yourself will disown me three times. ’

NIVUK	Mark	14	32	They went to a place called Gethsemane , and Jesus said to his disciples , ‘ Sit here while I pray. ’
NIVUK	Mark	14	33	He took Peter , James and John along with him , and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled .
NIVUK	Mark	14	34	‘ My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death , ’ he said to them . ‘ Stay here and keep watch. ’
NIVUK	Mark	14	35	Going a little farther , he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him .
NIVUK	Mark	14	36	‘ Abba , [ f ] Father , ’ he said , ‘ everything is possible for you . Take this cup from me . Yet not what I will , but what you will. ’
NIVUK	Mark	14	37	Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping . ‘ Simon , ’ he said to Peter , ‘ are you asleep ? Couldn ’ t you keep watch for one hour ?
NIVUK	Mark	14	38	Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation . The spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak. ’
NIVUK	Mark	14	39	Once more he went away and prayed the same thing .
NIVUK	Mark	14	40	When he came back , he again found them sleeping , because their eyes were heavy . They did not know what to say to him .
NIVUK	Mark	14	41	Returning the third time , he said to them , ‘ Are you still sleeping and resting ? Enough ! The hour has come . Look , the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners .
NIVUK	Mark	14	42	Rise ! Let us go ! Here comes my betrayer ! ’ Jesus arrested
NIVUK	Mark	14	43	Just as he was speaking , Judas , one of the Twelve , appeared . With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs , sent from the chief priests , the teachers of the law , and the elders .
NIVUK	Mark	14	44	Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them : ‘ The one I kiss is the man ; arrest him and lead him away under guard. ’
NIVUK	Mark	14	45	Going at once to Jesus , Judas said , ‘ Rabbi ! ’ and kissed him .
NIVUK	Mark	14	46	The men seized Jesus and arrested him .
NIVUK	Mark	14	47	Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest , cutting off his ear .
NIVUK	Mark	14	48	‘ Am I leading a rebellion , ’ said Jesus , ‘ that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me ?
NIVUK	Mark	14	49	Every day I was with you , teaching in the temple courts , and you did not arrest me . But the Scriptures must be fulfilled. ’

NIVUK	Mark	14	55	The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death , but they did not find any .
NIVUK	Mark	14	56	Many testified falsely against him , but their statements did not agree .
NIVUK	Mark	14	57	Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him :
NIVUK	Mark	14	58	‘ We heard him say , “ I will destroy this temple made with human hands and in three days will build another , not made with hands. ” ’
NIVUK	Mark	14	59	Yet even then their testimony did not agree .
NIVUK	Mark	14	60	Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus , ‘ Are you not going to answer ? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	14	61	But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer . Again the high priest asked him , ‘ Are you the Messiah , the Son of the Blessed One ? ’
NIVUK	Mark	14	62	‘ I am , ’ said Jesus . ‘ And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven. ’
NIVUK	Mark	14	63	The high priest tore his clothes . ‘ Why do we need any more witnesses ? ’ he asked .
NIVUK	Mark	14	64	‘ You have heard the blasphemy . What do you think ? ’ They all condemned him as worthy of death .
NIVUK	Mark	14	65	Then some began to spit at him ; they blindfolded him , struck him with their fists , and said , ‘ Prophesy ! ’ And the guards took him and beat him . Peter disowns Jesus
NIVUK	Mark	14	66	While Peter was below in the courtyard , one of the servant-girls of the high priest came by .
NIVUK	Mark	14	67	When she saw Peter warming himself , she looked closely at him . ‘ You also were with that Nazarene , Jesus , ’ she said .
NIVUK	Mark	14	68	But he denied it . ‘ I don ’ t know or understand what you ’ re talking about , ’ he said , and went out into the entrance . [ g ]
NIVUK	Mark	14	69	When the servant-girl saw him there , she said again to those standing round them , ‘ This fellow is one of them. ’
NIVUK	Mark	14	70	Again he denied it . After a little while , those standing near said to Peter , ‘ Surely you are one of them , for you are a Galilean. ’
NIVUK	Mark	14	71	He began to call down curses , and he swore to them , ‘ I don ’ t know this man you ’ re talking about. ’
NIVUK	Mark	14	72	Immediately the cock crowed the second time . [ h ] Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him : ‘ Before the cock crows twice [ i ] you will disown me three times. ’ And he broke down and wept .

NIVUK	Luke	1	1	Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled [ a ] among us ,
NIVUK	Luke	1	2	just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eye witnesses and servants of the word .
NIVUK	Luke	1	3	With this in mind , since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning , I too decided to write an orderly account for you , most excellent Theophilus ,
NIVUK	Luke	1	4	so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught . The birth of John the Baptist foretold
NIVUK	Luke	1	5	In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah , who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah ; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron .
NIVUK	Luke	1	6	Both of them were righteous in the sight of God , observing all the Lord ’ s commands and decrees blamelessly .
NIVUK	Luke	1	7	But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive , and they were both very old .
NIVUK	Luke	1	8	Once when Zechariah ’ s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God ,
NIVUK	Luke	1	9	he was chosen by lot , according to the custom of the priesthood , to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense .
NIVUK	Luke	1	10	And when the time for the burning of incense came , all the assembled worshippers were praying outside .
NIVUK	Luke	1	11	Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him , standing at the right side of the altar of incense .
NIVUK	Luke	1	12	When Zechariah saw him , he was startled and was gripped with fear .
NIVUK	Luke	1	13	But the angel said to him : ‘ Do not be afraid , Zechariah ; your prayer has been heard . Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son , and you are to call him John .
NIVUK	Luke	1	14	He will be a joy and delight to you , and many will rejoice because of his birth ,
NIVUK	Luke	1	15	for he will be great in the sight of the Lord . He is never to take wine or other fermented drink , and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born .
NIVUK	Luke	1	16	He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God .
NIVUK	Luke	1	17	And he will go on before the Lord , in the spirit and power of Elijah , to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous – to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. ’
NIVUK	Luke	1	18	Zechariah asked the angel , ‘ How can I be sure of this ? I am an old man and my wife is well on in years. ’
NIVUK	Luke	1	19	The angel said to him , ‘ I am Gabriel . I stand in the presence of God , and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news .
NIVUK	Luke	1	20	And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens , because you did not believe my words , which will come true at their appointed time. ’
NIVUK	Luke	1	21	Meanwhile , the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple .
NIVUK	Luke	1	22	When he came out , he could not speak to them . They realised he had seen a vision in the temple , for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak .

NIVUK	Luke	2	33	The child ’ s father and mother marvelled at what was said about him .

NIVUK	Luke	4	21	He began by saying to them , ‘ Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing. ’
NIVUK	Luke	4	22	All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips . ‘ Isn ’ t this Joseph ’ s son ? ’ they asked .
NIVUK	Luke	4	23	Jesus said to them , ‘ Surely you will quote this proverb to me : “ Physician , heal yourself ! ” And you will tell me , “ Do here in your home town what we have heard that you did in Capernaum. ” ’
NIVUK	Luke	4	24	‘ Truly I tell you , ’ he continued , ‘ no prophet is accepted in his home town .

NIVUK	Luke	5	5	Simon answered , ‘ Master , we ’ ve worked hard all night and haven ’ t caught anything . But because you say so , I will let down the nets. ’
NIVUK	Luke	5	2	He saw at the water ’ s edge two boats , left there by the fishermen , who were washing their nets .
NIVUK	Luke	5	3	He got into one of the boats , the one belonging to Simon , and asked him to put out a little from the shore . Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat .
NIVUK	Luke	5	4	When he had finished speaking , he said to Simon , ‘ Put out into deep water , and let down the nets for a catch. ’
NIVUK	Luke	5	6	When they had done so , they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break .
NIVUK	Luke	5	7	So they signalled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them , and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink .
NIVUK	Luke	5	8	When Simon Peter saw this , he fell at Jesus ’ knees and said , ‘ Go away from me , Lord ; I am a sinful man ! ’
NIVUK	Luke	5	9	For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken ,

NIVUK	Luke	5	13	Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man . ‘ I am willing , ’ he said . ‘ Be clean ! ’ And immediately the leprosy left him .
NIVUK	Luke	5	14	Then Jesus ordered him , ‘ Don ’ t tell anyone , but go , show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing , as a testimony to them. ’

NIVUK	Luke	5	19	When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd , they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd , right in front of Jesus .
NIVUK	Luke	5	20	When Jesus saw their faith , he said , ‘ Friend , your sins are forgiven. ’
NIVUK	Luke	5	21	The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves , ‘ Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy ? Who can forgive sins but God alone ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	5	22	Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked , ‘ Why are you thinking these things in your hearts ?
NIVUK	Luke	5	23	Which is easier : to say , “ Your sins are forgiven , ” or to say , “ Get up and walk ” ?
NIVUK	Luke	5	24	But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. ’ So he said to the paralysed man , ‘ I tell you , get up , take your mat and go home. ’
NIVUK	Luke	5	25	Immediately he stood up in front of them , took what he had been lying on and went home praising God .
NIVUK	Luke	5	26	Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God . They were filled with awe and said , ‘ We have seen remarkable things today. ’ Jesus calls Levi and eats with sinners
NIVUK	Luke	5	27	After this , Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth . ‘ Follow me , ’ Jesus said to him ,
NIVUK	Luke	5	28	and Levi got up , left everything and followed him .
NIVUK	Luke	5	29	Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house , and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them .
NIVUK	Luke	5	30	But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples , ‘ Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	5	31	Jesus answered them , ‘ It is not the healthy who need a doctor , but those who are ill.
NIVUK	Luke	5	32	I have not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance. ’ Jesus questioned about fasting
NIVUK	Luke	5	33	They said to him , ‘ John ’ s disciples often fast and pray , and so do the disciples of the Pharisees , but yours go on eating and drinking. ’
NIVUK	Luke	5	34	Jesus answered , ‘ Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is with them ?
NIVUK	Luke	5	35	But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them ; in those days they will fast. ’
NIVUK	Luke	5	36	He told them this parable : ‘ No one tears a piece out of a new garment to patch an old one . Otherwise , they will have torn the new garment , and the patch from the new will not match the old .
NIVUK	Luke	5	37	And no one pours new wine into old wineskins . Otherwise , the new wine will burst the skins ; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined .
NIVUK	Luke	5	38	No , new wine must be poured into new wineskins .
NIVUK	Luke	5	39	And no one after drinking old wine wants the new , for they say , “ The old is better. ” ’ Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Luke	6	6	On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching , and a man was there whose right hand was shrivelled .
NIVUK	Luke	6	2	Some of the Pharisees asked , ‘ Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	6	3	Jesus answered them , ‘ Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry ?
NIVUK	Luke	6	4	He entered the house of God , and taking the consecrated bread , he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat . And he also gave some to his companions. ’
NIVUK	Luke	6	5	Then Jesus said to them , ‘ The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath. ’
NIVUK	Luke	6	7	The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus , so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath .
NIVUK	Luke	6	8	But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shrivelled hand , ‘ Get up and stand in front of everyone. ’ So he got up and stood there .
NIVUK	Luke	6	9	Then Jesus said to them , ‘ I ask you , which is lawful on the Sabbath : to do good or to do evil , to save life or to destroy it ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	6	10	He looked round at them all , and then said to the man , ‘ Stretch out your hand. ’ He did so , and his hand was completely restored .
NIVUK	Luke	6	11	But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus . The twelve apostles
NIVUK	Luke	6	12	One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray , and spent the night praying to God .
NIVUK	Luke	6	13	When morning came , he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them , whom he also designated apostles :
NIVUK	Luke	6	14	Simon ( whom he named Peter ) , his brother Andrew , James , John , Philip , Bartholomew ,
NIVUK	Luke	6	15	Matthew , Thomas , James son of Alphaeus , Simon who was called the Zealot ,
NIVUK	Luke	6	16	Judas son of James , and Judas Iscariot , who became a traitor . Blessings and woes
NIVUK	Luke	6	17	He went down with them and stood on a level place . A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea , from Jerusalem , and from the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon ,
NIVUK	Luke	6	18	who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases . Those troubled by impure spirits were cured ,
NIVUK	Luke	6	19	and the people all tried to touch him , because power was coming from him and healing them all .
NIVUK	Luke	6	20	Looking at his disciples , he said : ‘ Blessed are you who are poor , for yours is the kingdom of God .
NIVUK	Luke	6	21	Blessed are you who hunger now , for you will be satisfied . Blessed are you who weep now , for you will laugh .
NIVUK	Luke	6	22	Blessed are you when people hate you , when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil , because of the Son of Man .
NIVUK	Luke	6	23	‘ Rejoice in that day and leap for joy , because great is your reward in heaven . For that is how their ancestors treated the prophets .
NIVUK	Luke	6	24	‘ But woe to you who are rich , for you have already received your comfort .
NIVUK	Luke	6	25	Woe to you who are well fed now , for you will go hungry . Woe to you who laugh now , for you will mourn and weep .
NIVUK	Luke	6	26	Woe to you when everyone speaks well of you , for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets . Love for enemies
NIVUK	Luke	6	27	‘ But to you who are listening I say : love your enemies , do good to those who hate you ,
NIVUK	Luke	6	28	bless those who curse you , pray for those who ill-treat you .
NIVUK	Luke	6	29	If someone slaps you on one cheek , turn to them the other also . If someone takes your coat , do not withhold your shirt from them .
NIVUK	Luke	6	30	Give to everyone who asks you , and if anyone takes what belongs to you , do not demand it back .
NIVUK	Luke	6	31	Do to others as you would have them do to you .
NIVUK	Luke	6	32	‘ If you love those who love you , what credit is that to you ? Even sinners love those who love them .
NIVUK	Luke	6	33	And if you do good to those who are good to you , what credit is that to you ? Even sinners do that .
NIVUK	Luke	6	34	And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment , what credit is that to you ? Even sinners lend to sinners , expecting to be repaid in full .
NIVUK	Luke	6	35	But love your enemies , do good to them , and lend to them without expecting to get anything back . Then your reward will be great , and you will be children of the Most High , because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked .
NIVUK	Luke	6	36	Be merciful , just as your Father is merciful . Judging others
NIVUK	Luke	6	37	‘ Do not judge , and you will not be judged . Do not condemn , and you will not be condemned . Forgive , and you will be forgiven .
NIVUK	Luke	6	38	Give , and it will be given to you . A good measure , pressed down , shaken together and running over , will be poured into your lap . For with the measure you use , it will be measured to you. ’
NIVUK	Luke	6	39	He also told them this parable : ‘ Can the blind lead the blind ? Will they not both fall into a pit ?
NIVUK	Luke	6	40	The student is not above the teacher , but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher .
NIVUK	Luke	6	41	‘ Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother ’ s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye ?
NIVUK	Luke	6	42	How can you say to your brother , “ Brother , let me take the speck out of your eye , ” when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye ? You hypocrite , first take the plank out of your eye , and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother ’ s eye . A tree and its fruit
NIVUK	Luke	6	43	‘ No good tree bears bad fruit , nor does a bad tree bear good fruit .
NIVUK	Luke	6	44	Each tree is recognised by its own fruit . People do not pick figs from thorn-bushes , or grapes from briers .
NIVUK	Luke	6	45	A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart , and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart . For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of . The wise and foolish builders
NIVUK	Luke	6	46	‘ Why do you call me , “ Lord , Lord , ” and do not do what I say ?
NIVUK	Luke	6	47	As for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice , I will show you what they are like .
NIVUK	Luke	6	48	They are like a man building a house , who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock . When the flood came , the torrent struck that house but could not shake it , because it was well built .
NIVUK	Luke	6	49	But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation . The moment the torrent struck that house , it collapsed and its destruction was complete. ’ Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Luke	7	7	That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you . But say the word , and my servant will be healed .
NIVUK	Luke	7	2	There a centurion ’ s servant , whom his master valued highly , was ill and about to die .
NIVUK	Luke	7	3	The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him , asking him to come and heal his servant .
NIVUK	Luke	7	4	When they came to Jesus , they pleaded earnestly with him , ‘ This man deserves to have you do this ,
NIVUK	Luke	7	5	because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue. ’
NIVUK	Luke	7	6	So Jesus went with them . He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him : ‘ Lord , don ’ t trouble yourself , for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof .
NIVUK	Luke	7	8	For I myself am a man under authority , with soldiers under me . I tell this one , “ Go ” , and he goes ; and that one , “ Come ” , and he comes . I say to my servant , “ Do this ” , and he does it. ’
NIVUK	Luke	7	9	When Jesus heard this , he was amazed at him , and turning to the crowd following him , he said , ‘ I tell you , I have not found such great faith even in Israel. ’
NIVUK	Luke	7	10	Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well . Jesus raises a widow ’ s son
NIVUK	Luke	7	11	Soon afterwards , Jesus went to a town called Nain , and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him .
NIVUK	Luke	7	12	As he approached the town gate , a dead person was being carried out – the only son of his mother , and she was a widow . And a large crowd from the town was with her .
NIVUK	Luke	7	13	When the Lord saw her , his heart went out to her and he said , ‘ Don ’ t cry. ’
NIVUK	Luke	7	14	Then he went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on , and the bearers stood still . He said , ‘ Young man , I say to you , get up ! ’
NIVUK	Luke	7	15	The dead man sat up and began to talk , and Jesus gave him back to his mother .
NIVUK	Luke	7	16	They were all filled with awe and praised God . ‘ A great prophet has appeared among us , ’ they said . ‘ God has come to help his people. ’
NIVUK	Luke	7	17	This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country . Jesus and John the Baptist
NIVUK	Luke	7	18	John ’ s disciples told him about all these things . Calling two of them ,
NIVUK	Luke	7	19	he sent them to the Lord to ask , ‘ Are you the one who is to come , or should we expect someone else ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	7	20	When the men came to Jesus , they said , ‘ John the Baptist sent us to you to ask , “ Are you the one who is to come , or should we expect someone else ? ” ’
NIVUK	Luke	7	21	At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases , illnesses and evil spirits , and gave sight to many who were blind .
NIVUK	Luke	7	22	So he replied to the messengers , ‘ Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard : the blind receive sight , the lame walk , those who have leprosy [ a ] are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , and the good news is proclaimed to the poor .
NIVUK	Luke	7	23	Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me. ’
NIVUK	Luke	7	24	After John ’ s messengers left , Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John : ‘ What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed swayed by the wind ?
NIVUK	Luke	7	25	If not , what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in fine clothes ? No , those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces .
NIVUK	Luke	7	26	But what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
NIVUK	Luke	7	27	This is the one about whom it is written : ‘ “ I will send my messenger ahead of you , who will prepare your way before you. ” [ b ]
NIVUK	Luke	7	28	I tell you , among those born of women there is no one greater than John ; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. ’
NIVUK	Luke	7	29	( All the people , even the tax collectors , when they heard Jesus ’ words , acknowledged that God ’ s way was right , because they had been baptised by John .
NIVUK	Luke	7	30	But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God ’ s purpose for themselves , because they had not been baptised by John . )
NIVUK	Luke	7	31	Jesus went on to say , ‘ To what , then , can I compare the people of this generation ? What are they like ?
NIVUK	Luke	7	32	They are like children sitting in the market-place and calling out to each other : ‘ “ We played the pipe for you , and you did not dance ; we sang a dirge , and you did not cry. ”
NIVUK	Luke	7	33	For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and you say , “ He has a demon. ”
NIVUK	Luke	7	34	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and you say , “ Here is a glutton and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners. ”
NIVUK	Luke	7	35	But wisdom is proved right by all her children. ’ Jesus anointed by a sinful woman
NIVUK	Luke	7	36	When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him , he went to the Pharisee ’ s house and reclined at the table .
NIVUK	Luke	7	37	A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee ’ s house , so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume .
NIVUK	Luke	7	38	As she stood behind him at his feet weeping , she began to wet his feet with her tears . Then she wiped them with her hair , kissed them and poured perfume on them .
NIVUK	Luke	7	39	When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this , he said to himself , ‘ If this man were a prophet , he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is – that she is a sinner. ’
NIVUK	Luke	7	40	Jesus answered him , ‘ Simon , I have something to tell you. ’ ‘ Tell me , teacher , ’ he said .
NIVUK	Luke	7	41	‘ Two people owed money to a certain money-lender . One owed him five hundred denarii , [ c ] and the other fifty .
NIVUK	Luke	7	42	Neither of them had the money to pay him back , so he forgave the debts of both . Now which of them will love him more ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	7	43	Simon replied , ‘ I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven. ’ ‘ You have judged correctly , ’ Jesus said .
NIVUK	Luke	7	44	Then he turned towards the woman and said to Simon , ‘ Do you see this woman ? I came into your house . You did not give me any water for my feet , but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair .
NIVUK	Luke	7	45	You did not give me a kiss , but this woman , from the time I entered , has not stopped kissing my feet .
NIVUK	Luke	7	46	You did not put oil on my head , but she has poured perfume on my feet .
NIVUK	Luke	7	47	Therefore , I tell you , her many sins have been forgiven – as her great love has shown . But whoever has been forgiven little loves little. ’
NIVUK	Luke	7	48	Then Jesus said to her , ‘ Your sins are forgiven. ’
NIVUK	Luke	7	49	The other guests began to say among themselves , ‘ Who is this who even forgives sins ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	7	50	Jesus said to the woman , ‘ Your faith has saved you ; go in peace. ’ Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Luke	8	8	Still other seed fell on good soil . It came up and yielded a crop , a hundred times more than was sown. ’ When he said this , he called out , ‘ Whoever has ears to hear , let them hear. ’
NIVUK	Luke	8	2	and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases : Mary ( called Magdalene ) from whom seven demons had come out ;
NIVUK	Luke	8	3	Joanna the wife of Chuza , the manager of Herod ’ s household ; Susanna ; and many others . These women were helping to support them out of their own means .
NIVUK	Luke	8	4	While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town , he told this parable :
NIVUK	Luke	8	5	‘ A farmer went out to sow his seed . As he was scattering the seed , some fell along the path ; it was trampled on , and the birds ate it up .
NIVUK	Luke	8	6	Some fell on rocky ground , and when it came up , the plants withered because they had no moisture .
NIVUK	Luke	8	7	Other seed fell among thorns , which grew up with it and choked the plants .
NIVUK	Luke	8	9	His disciples asked him what this parable meant .
NIVUK	Luke	8	10	He said , ‘ The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you , but to others I speak in parables , so that , ‘ “ though seeing , they may not see ; though hearing , they may not understand. ” [ a ]
NIVUK	Luke	8	11	‘ This is the meaning of the parable : the seed is the word of God .
NIVUK	Luke	8	12	Those along the path are the ones who hear , and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts , so that they may not believe and be saved .
NIVUK	Luke	8	13	Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it , but they have no root . They believe for a while , but in the time of testing they fall away .
NIVUK	Luke	8	14	The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear , but as they go on their way they are choked by life ’ s worries , riches and pleasures , and they do not mature .
NIVUK	Luke	8	15	But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart , who hear the word , retain it , and by persevering produce a crop . A lamp on a stand
NIVUK	Luke	8	16	‘ No one lights a lamp and hides it in a clay jar or puts it under a bed . Instead , they put it on a stand , so that those who come in can see the light .
NIVUK	Luke	8	17	For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed , and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open .
NIVUK	Luke	8	18	Therefore consider carefully how you listen . Whoever has will be given more ; whoever does not have , even what they think they have will be taken from them. ’ Jesus ’ mother and brothers
NIVUK	Luke	8	19	Now Jesus ’ mother and brothers came to see him , but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd .
NIVUK	Luke	8	20	Someone told him , ‘ Your mother and brothers are standing outside , wanting to see you. ’
NIVUK	Luke	8	21	He replied , ‘ My mother and brothers are those who hear God ’ s word and put it into practice. ’ Jesus calms the storm
NIVUK	Luke	8	22	One day Jesus said to his disciples , ‘ Let us go over to the other side of the lake. ’ So they got into a boat and set out .
NIVUK	Luke	8	23	As they sailed , he fell asleep . A squall came down on the lake , so that the boat was being swamped , and they were in great danger .
NIVUK	Luke	8	24	The disciples went and woke him , saying , ‘ Master , Master , we ’ re going to drown ! ’ He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters ; the storm subsided , and all was calm .
NIVUK	Luke	8	25	‘ Where is your faith ? ’ he asked his disciples . In fear and amazement they asked one another , ‘ Who is this ? He commands even the winds and the water , and they obey him. ’ Jesus restores a demon-possessed man
NIVUK	Luke	8	26	They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes , [ b ] which is across the lake from Galilee .
NIVUK	Luke	8	27	When Jesus stepped ashore , he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town . For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house , but had lived in the tombs .
NIVUK	Luke	8	28	When he saw Jesus , he cried out and fell at his feet , shouting at the top of his voice , ‘ What do you want with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I beg you , don ’ t torture me ! ’
NIVUK	Luke	8	29	For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man . Many times it had seized him , and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard , he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places .
NIVUK	Luke	8	30	Jesus asked him , ‘ What is your name ? ’ ‘ Legion , ’ he replied , because many demons had gone into him .
NIVUK	Luke	8	31	And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss .
NIVUK	Luke	8	32	A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside . The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs , and he gave them permission .
NIVUK	Luke	8	33	When the demons came out of the man , they went into the pigs , and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned .
NIVUK	Luke	8	34	When those tending the pigs saw what had happened , they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside ,
NIVUK	Luke	8	35	and the people went out to see what had happened . When they came to Jesus , they found the man from whom the demons had gone out , sitting at Jesus ’ feet , dressed and in his right mind ; and they were afraid .
NIVUK	Luke	8	36	Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured .
NIVUK	Luke	8	37	Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them , because they were overcome with fear . So he got into the boat and left .
NIVUK	Luke	8	38	The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him , but Jesus sent him away , saying ,
NIVUK	Luke	8	39	‘ Return home and tell how much God has done for you. ’ So the man went away and told all over the town how much Jesus had done for him . Jesus raises a dead girl and heals a sick woman
NIVUK	Luke	8	40	Now when Jesus returned , a crowd welcomed him , for they were all expecting him .
NIVUK	Luke	8	41	Then a man named Jairus , a synagogue leader , came and fell at Jesus ’ feet , pleading with him to come to his house
NIVUK	Luke	8	42	because his only daughter , a girl of about twelve , was dying . As Jesus was on his way , the crowds almost crushed him .
NIVUK	Luke	8	43	And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years , [ c ] but no one could heal her .
NIVUK	Luke	8	44	She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak , and immediately her bleeding stopped .
NIVUK	Luke	8	45	‘ Who touched me ? ’ Jesus asked . When they all denied it , Peter said , ‘ Master , the people are crowding and pressing against you. ’
NIVUK	Luke	8	46	But Jesus said , ‘ Someone touched me ; I know that power has gone out from me. ’
NIVUK	Luke	8	47	Then the woman , seeing that she could not go unnoticed , came trembling and fell at his feet . In the presence of all the people , she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed .
NIVUK	Luke	8	48	Then he said to her , ‘ Daughter , your faith has healed you . Go in peace. ’
NIVUK	Luke	8	49	While Jesus was still speaking , someone came from the house of Jairus , the synagogue leader . ‘ Your daughter is dead , ’ he said . ‘ Don ’ t bother the teacher anymore. ’
NIVUK	Luke	8	50	Hearing this , Jesus said to Jairus , ‘ Don ’ t be afraid ; just believe , and she will be healed. ’
NIVUK	Luke	8	51	When he arrived at the house of Jairus , he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter , John and James , and the child ’ s father and mother .
NIVUK	Luke	8	52	Meanwhile , all the people were wailing and mourning for her . ‘ Stop wailing , ’ Jesus said . ‘ She is not dead but asleep. ’
NIVUK	Luke	8	53	They laughed at him , knowing that she was dead .
NIVUK	Luke	8	54	But he took her by the hand and said , ‘ My child , get up ! ’
NIVUK	Luke	8	55	Her spirit returned , and at once she stood up . Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat .
NIVUK	Luke	8	56	Her parents were astonished , but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Luke	9	9	But Herod said , ‘ I beheaded John . Who , then , is this I hear such things about ? ’ And he tried to see him . Jesus feeds the five thousand
NIVUK	Luke	9	2	and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal those who were ill.
NIVUK	Luke	9	3	He told them : ‘ Take nothing for the journey – no staff , no bag , no bread , no money , no extra shirt .
NIVUK	Luke	9	4	Whatever house you enter , stay there until you leave that town .
NIVUK	Luke	9	5	If people do not welcome you , leave their town and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them. ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	6	So they set out and went from village to village , proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere .
NIVUK	Luke	9	7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on . And he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead ,
NIVUK	Luke	9	8	others that Elijah had appeared , and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life .
NIVUK	Luke	9	10	When the apostles returned , they reported to Jesus what they had done . Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida ,
NIVUK	Luke	9	11	but the crowds learned about it and followed him . He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God , and healed those who needed healing .
NIVUK	Luke	9	12	Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said , ‘ Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging , because we are in a remote place here. ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	13	He replied , ‘ You give them something to eat. ’ They answered , ‘ We have only five loaves of bread and two fish – unless we go and buy food for all this crowd. ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	14	( About five thousand men were there . ) But he said to his disciples , ‘ Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each. ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	15	The disciples did so , and everyone sat down .
NIVUK	Luke	9	16	Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven , he gave thanks and broke them . Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people .
NIVUK	Luke	9	17	They all ate and were satisfied , and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over . Peter declares that Jesus is the Messiah
NIVUK	Luke	9	18	Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him , he asked them , ‘ Who do the crowds say I am ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	19	They replied , ‘ Some say John the Baptist ; others say Elijah ; and still others , that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life. ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	20	‘ But what about you ? ’ he asked . ‘ Who do you say I am ? ’ Peter answered , ‘ God ’ s Messiah. ’ Jesus predicts his death
NIVUK	Luke	9	21	Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone .
NIVUK	Luke	9	22	And he said , ‘ The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders , the chief priests and the teachers of the law , and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life. ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	23	Then he said to them all : ‘ Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me .
NIVUK	Luke	9	24	For whoever wants to save their life will lose it , but whoever loses their life for me will save it .
NIVUK	Luke	9	25	What good is it for someone to gain the whole world , and yet lose or forfeit their very self ?
NIVUK	Luke	9	26	Whoever is ashamed of me and my words , the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels .
NIVUK	Luke	9	27	‘ Truly I tell you , some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God. ’ The transfiguration
NIVUK	Luke	9	28	About eight days after Jesus said this , he took Peter , John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray .
NIVUK	Luke	9	29	As he was praying , the appearance of his face changed , and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning .
NIVUK	Luke	9	30	Two men , Moses and Elijah , appeared in glorious splendour , talking with Jesus .
NIVUK	Luke	9	31	They spoke about his departure , [ a ] which he was about to bring to fulfilment at Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Luke	9	32	Peter and his companions were very sleepy , but when they became fully awake , they saw his glory and the two men standing with him .
NIVUK	Luke	9	33	As the men were leaving Jesus , Peter said to him , ‘ Master , it is good for us to be here . Let us put up three shelters – one for you , one for Moses and one for Elijah. ’ ( He did not know what he was saying . )
NIVUK	Luke	9	34	While he was speaking , a cloud appeared and covered them , and they were afraid as they entered the cloud .
NIVUK	Luke	9	35	A voice came from the cloud , saying , ‘ This is my Son , whom I have chosen ; listen to him. ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	36	When the voice had spoken , they found that Jesus was alone . The disciples kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen . Jesus heals a demon-possessed boy
NIVUK	Luke	9	37	The next day , when they came down from the mountain , a large crowd met him .
NIVUK	Luke	9	38	A man in the crowd called out , ‘ Teacher , I beg you to look at my son , for he is my only child .
NIVUK	Luke	9	39	A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams ; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth . It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him .
NIVUK	Luke	9	40	I begged your disciples to drive it out , but they could not. ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	41	‘ You unbelieving and perverse generation , ’ Jesus replied , ‘ how long shall I stay with you and put up with you ? Bring your son here. ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	42	Even while the boy was coming , the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion . But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit , healed the boy and gave him back to his father .
NIVUK	Luke	9	43	And they were all amazed at the greatness of God . Jesus predicts his death a second time While everyone was marvelling at all that Jesus did , he said to his disciples ,
NIVUK	Luke	9	44	‘ Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you : the Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	45	But they did not understand what this meant . It was hidden from them , so that they did not grasp it , and they were afraid to ask him about it .
NIVUK	Luke	9	46	An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest .
NIVUK	Luke	9	47	Jesus , knowing their thoughts , took a little child and made him stand beside him .
NIVUK	Luke	9	48	Then he said to them , ‘ Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me ; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me . For it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest. ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	49	‘ Master , ’ said John , ‘ we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him , because he is not one of us. ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	50	‘ Do not stop him , ’ Jesus said , ‘ for whoever is not against you is for you. ’ Samaritan opposition
NIVUK	Luke	9	51	As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven , Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Luke	9	52	And he sent messengers on ahead , who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him ;
NIVUK	Luke	9	53	but the people there did not welcome him , because he was heading for Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Luke	9	54	When the disciples James and John saw this , they asked , ‘ Lord , do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them [ b ] ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	55	But Jesus turned and rebuked them .
NIVUK	Luke	9	56	Then he and his disciples went to another village . The cost of following Jesus
NIVUK	Luke	9	57	As they were walking along the road , a man said to him , ‘ I will follow you wherever you go. ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	58	Jesus replied , ‘ Foxes have dens and birds have nests , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head. ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	59	He said to another man , ‘ Follow me. ’ But he replied , ‘ Lord , first let me go and bury my father. ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	60	Jesus said to him , ‘ Let the dead bury their own dead , but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God. ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	61	Still another said , ‘ I will follow you , Lord ; but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family. ’
NIVUK	Luke	9	62	Jesus replied , ‘ No one who puts a hand to the plough and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God. ’ Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Luke	10	6	If someone who promotes peace is there , your peace will rest on them ; if not , it will return to you .

NIVUK	Luke	10	18	He replied , ‘ I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven .
NIVUK	Luke	10	19	I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy ; nothing will harm you .
NIVUK	Luke	10	20	However , do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you , but rejoice that your names are written in heaven. ’
NIVUK	Luke	10	21	At that time Jesus , full of joy through the Holy Spirit , said , ‘ I praise you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned , and revealed them to little children . Yes , Father , for this is what you were pleased to do .
NIVUK	Luke	10	22	‘ All things have been committed to me by my Father . No one knows who the Son is except the Father , and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. ’

NIVUK	Luke	10	25	On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus . ‘ Teacher , ’ he asked , ‘ what must I do to inherit eternal life ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	10	26	‘ What is written in the Law ? ’ he replied . ‘ How do you read it ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	10	27	He answered , ‘ “ Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind ” [ c ] ; and , “ Love your neighbour as yourself. ” [ d ] ’
NIVUK	Luke	10	28	‘ You have answered correctly , ’ Jesus replied . ‘ Do this and you will live. ’
NIVUK	Luke	10	29	But he wanted to justify himself , so he asked Jesus , ‘ And who is my neighbour ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	10	30	In reply Jesus said : ‘ A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , when he was attacked by robbers . They stripped him of his clothes , beat him and went away , leaving him half-dead .
NIVUK	Luke	10	31	A priest happened to be going down the same road , and when he saw the man , he passed by on the other side .
NIVUK	Luke	10	32	So too , a Levite , when he came to the place and saw him , passed by on the other side .
NIVUK	Luke	10	33	But a Samaritan , as he travelled , came where the man was ; and when he saw him , he took pity on him .
NIVUK	Luke	10	34	He went to him and bandaged his wounds , pouring on oil and wine . Then he put the man on his own donkey , brought him to an inn and took care of him .
NIVUK	Luke	10	35	The next day he took out two denarii [ e ] and gave them to the innkeeper . “ Look after him , ” he said , “ and when I return , I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have. ”
NIVUK	Luke	10	36	‘ Which of these three do you think was a neighbour to the man who fell into the hands of robbers ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	10	37	The expert in the law replied , ‘ The one who had mercy on him. ’ Jesus told him , ‘ Go and do likewise. ’ At the home of Martha and Mary
NIVUK	Luke	10	38	As Jesus and his disciples were on their way , he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him .
NIVUK	Luke	10	39	She had a sister called Mary , who sat at the Lord ’ s feet listening to what he said .
NIVUK	Luke	10	40	But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made . She came to him and asked , ‘ Lord , don ’ t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself ? Tell her to help me ! ’
NIVUK	Luke	10	41	‘ Martha , Martha , ’ the Lord answered , ‘ you are worried and upset about many things ,
NIVUK	Luke	10	42	but few things are needed – or indeed only one . [ f ] Mary has chosen what is better , and it will not be taken away from her. ’ Footnotes - Luke 10:1 Some manuscripts seventy ; also in verse

NIVUK	Luke	11	11	‘ Which of you fathers , if your son asks for [ f ] a fish , will give him a snake instead ?
NIVUK	Luke	11	2	He said to them , ‘ When you pray , say : ‘ “ Father , [ a ] hallowed be your name , your kingdom come . [ b ]
NIVUK	Luke	11	3	Give us each day our daily bread .
NIVUK	Luke	11	4	Forgive us our sins , for we also forgive everyone who sins against us . [ c ] And lead us not into temptation. ” ’ [ d ]
NIVUK	Luke	11	5	Then Jesus said to them , ‘ Suppose you have a friend , and you go to him at midnight and say , “ Friend , lend me three loaves of bread ;
NIVUK	Luke	11	6	a friend of mine on a journey has come to me , and I have no food to offer him. ”
NIVUK	Luke	11	7	And suppose the one inside answers , “ Don ’ t bother me . The door is already locked , and my children and I are in bed . I can ’ t get up and give you anything. ”
NIVUK	Luke	11	8	I tell you , even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship , yet because of your shameless audacity [ e ] he will surely get up and give you as much as you need .
NIVUK	Luke	11	9	‘ So I say to you : ask and it will be given to you ; seek and you will find ; knock and the door will be opened to you .
NIVUK	Luke	11	10	For everyone who asks receives ; the one who seeks finds ; and to the one who knocks , the door will be opened .
NIVUK	Luke	11	12	Or if he asks for an egg , will give him a scorpion ?
NIVUK	Luke	11	13	If you then , though you are evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ! ’ Jesus and Beelzebul
NIVUK	Luke	11	14	Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute . When the demon left , the man who had been mute spoke , and the crowd was amazed .
NIVUK	Luke	11	15	But some of them said , ‘ By Beelzebul , the prince of demons , he is driving out demons. ’
NIVUK	Luke	11	16	Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven .
NIVUK	Luke	11	17	Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them : ‘ Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined , and a house divided against itself will fall .
NIVUK	Luke	11	18	If Satan is divided against himself , how can his kingdom stand ? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebul .
NIVUK	Luke	11	19	Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebul , by whom do your followers drive them out ? So then , they will be your judges .
NIVUK	Luke	11	20	But if I drive out demons by the finger of God , then the kingdom of God has come upon you .
NIVUK	Luke	11	21	‘ When a strong man , fully armed , guards his own house , his possessions are safe .
NIVUK	Luke	11	22	But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him , he takes away the armour in which the man trusted and divides up his plunder .
NIVUK	Luke	11	23	‘ Whoever is not with me is against me , and whoever does not gather with me scatters .
NIVUK	Luke	11	24	‘ When an impure spirit comes out of a person , it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it . Then it says , “ I will return to the house I left. ”
NIVUK	Luke	11	25	When it arrives , it finds the house swept clean and put in order .
NIVUK	Luke	11	26	Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself , and they go in and live there . And the final condition of that person is worse than the first. ’
NIVUK	Luke	11	27	As Jesus was saying these things , a woman in the crowd called out , ‘ Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you. ’
NIVUK	Luke	11	28	He replied , ‘ Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it. ’ The sign of Jonah
NIVUK	Luke	11	29	As the crowds increased , Jesus said , ‘ This is a wicked generation . It asks for a sign , but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah .
NIVUK	Luke	11	30	For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites , so also will the Son of Man be to this generation .
NIVUK	Luke	11	31	The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them , for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon ’ s wisdom ; and now something greater than Solomon is here .
NIVUK	Luke	11	32	The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it , for they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and now something greater than Jonah is here . The lamp of the body
NIVUK	Luke	11	33	‘ No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden , or under a bowl . Instead they put it on its stand , so that those who come in may see the light .
NIVUK	Luke	11	34	Your eye is the lamp of your body . When your eyes are healthy , [ g ] your whole body also is full of light . But when they are unhealthy , [ h ] your body also is full of darkness .
NIVUK	Luke	11	35	See to it , then , that the light within you is not darkness .
NIVUK	Luke	11	36	Therefore , if your whole body is full of light , and no part of it dark , it will be just as full of light as when a lamp shines its light on you. ’ Woes on the Pharisees and the experts in the law
NIVUK	Luke	11	37	When Jesus had finished speaking , a Pharisee invited him to eat with him ; so he went in and reclined at the table .
NIVUK	Luke	11	38	But the Pharisee was surprised when he noticed that Jesus did not first wash before the meal .
NIVUK	Luke	11	39	Then the Lord said to him , ‘ Now then , you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish , but inside you are full of greed and wickedness .
NIVUK	Luke	11	40	You foolish people ! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also ?
NIVUK	Luke	11	41	But now as for what is inside you – be generous to the poor , and everything will be clean for you .
NIVUK	Luke	11	42	‘ Woe to you Pharisees , because you give God a tenth of your mint , rue and all other kinds of garden herbs , but you neglect justice and the love of God . You should have practised the latter without leaving the former undone .
NIVUK	Luke	11	43	‘ Woe to you Pharisees , because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the market-places .
NIVUK	Luke	11	44	‘ Woe to you , because you are like unmarked graves , which people walk over without knowing it. ’
NIVUK	Luke	11	45	One of the experts in the law answered him , ‘ Teacher , when you say these things , you insult us also. ’
NIVUK	Luke	11	46	Jesus replied , ‘ And you experts in the law , woe to you , because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry , and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them .
NIVUK	Luke	11	47	‘ Woe to you , because you build tombs for the prophets , and it was your ancestors who killed them .
NIVUK	Luke	11	48	So you testify that you approve of what your ancestors did ; they killed the prophets , and you build their tombs .
NIVUK	Luke	11	49	Because of this , God in his wisdom said , “ I will send them prophets and apostles , some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute. ”
NIVUK	Luke	11	50	Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world ,
NIVUK	Luke	11	51	from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah , who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary . Yes , I tell you , this generation will be held responsible for it all .
NIVUK	Luke	11	52	‘ Woe to you experts in the law , because you have taken away the key to knowledge . You yourselves have not entered , and you have hindered those who were entering. ’
NIVUK	Luke	11	53	When Jesus went outside , the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions ,

NIVUK	Luke	12	2	There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed , or hidden that will not be made known .
NIVUK	Luke	12	3	What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight , and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs .
NIVUK	Luke	12	4	‘ I tell you , my friends , do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more .
NIVUK	Luke	12	5	But I will show you whom you should fear : fear him who , after your body has been killed , has authority to throw you into hell . Yes , I tell you , fear him .
NIVUK	Luke	12	6	Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies ? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God .
NIVUK	Luke	12	7	Indeed , the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Don ’ t be afraid ; you are worth more than many sparrows .
NIVUK	Luke	12	8	‘ I tell you , whoever publicly acknowledges me before others , the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God .
NIVUK	Luke	12	9	But whoever disowns me before others will be disowned before the angels of God .

NIVUK	Luke	12	14	Jesus replied , ‘ Man , who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	12	15	Then he said to them , ‘ Watch out ! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed ; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions. ’
NIVUK	Luke	12	16	And he told them this parable : ‘ The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest .
NIVUK	Luke	12	17	He thought to himself , “ What shall I do ? I have no place to store my crops. ”
NIVUK	Luke	12	18	‘ Then he said , “ This is what I ’ ll do . I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones , and there I will store my surplus grain .
NIVUK	Luke	12	19	And I ’ ll say to myself , ‘ You have plenty of grain laid up for many years . Take life easy ; eat , drink and be merry. ’ ”
NIVUK	Luke	12	20	‘ But God said to him , “ You fool ! This very night your life will be demanded from you . Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself ? ”
NIVUK	Luke	12	21	‘ This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich towards God. ’ Do not worry
NIVUK	Luke	12	22	Then Jesus said to his disciples : ‘ Therefore I tell you , do not worry about your life , what you will eat ; or about your body , what you will wear .
NIVUK	Luke	12	23	For life is more than food , and the body more than clothes .
NIVUK	Luke	12	24	Consider the ravens : they do not sow or reap , they have no storeroom or barn ; yet God feeds them . And how much more valuable you are than birds !
NIVUK	Luke	12	25	Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life [ b ] ?
NIVUK	Luke	12	26	Since you can not do this very little thing , why do you worry about the rest ?
NIVUK	Luke	12	27	‘ Consider how the wild flowers grow . They do not labour or spin . Yet I tell you , not even Solomon in all his splendour was dressed like one of these .
NIVUK	Luke	12	28	If that is how God clothes the grass of the field , which is here today , and tomorrow is thrown into the fire , how much more will he clothe you – you of little faith !
NIVUK	Luke	12	29	And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink ; do not worry about it .
NIVUK	Luke	12	30	For the pagan world runs after all such things , and your Father knows that you need them .
NIVUK	Luke	12	31	But seek his kingdom , and these things will be given to you as well .
NIVUK	Luke	12	32	‘ Do not be afraid , little flock , for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom .
NIVUK	Luke	12	33	Sell your possessions and give to the poor . Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out , a treasure in heaven that will never fail , where no thief comes near and no moth destroys .
NIVUK	Luke	12	34	For where your treasure is , there your heart will be also . Watchfulness
NIVUK	Luke	12	35	‘ Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning ,
NIVUK	Luke	12	36	like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet , so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him .
NIVUK	Luke	12	37	It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes . Truly I tell you , he will dress himself to serve , will make them recline at the table and will come and wait on them .
NIVUK	Luke	12	38	It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready , even if he comes in the middle of the night or towards daybreak .
NIVUK	Luke	12	39	But understand this : if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming , he would not have let his house be broken into .
NIVUK	Luke	12	40	You also must be ready , because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him. ’
NIVUK	Luke	12	41	Peter asked , ‘ Lord , are you telling this parable to us , or to everyone ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	12	42	The Lord answered , ‘ Who then is the faithful and wise manager , whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time ?
NIVUK	Luke	12	43	It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns .
NIVUK	Luke	12	44	Truly I tell you , he will put him in charge of all his possessions .
NIVUK	Luke	12	45	But suppose the servant says to himself , “ My master is taking a long time in coming , ” and he then begins to beat the other servants , both men and women , and to eat and drink and get drunk .
NIVUK	Luke	12	46	The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of . He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers .
NIVUK	Luke	12	47	‘ The servant who knows the master ’ s will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows .
NIVUK	Luke	12	48	But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows . From everyone who has been given much , much will be demanded ; and from the one who has been entrusted with much , much more will be asked . Not peace but division
NIVUK	Luke	12	49	‘ I have come to bring fire on the earth , and how I wish it were already kindled !
NIVUK	Luke	12	50	But I have a baptism to undergo , and what constraint I am under until it is completed !
NIVUK	Luke	12	51	Do you think I came to bring peace on earth ? No , I tell you , but division .
NIVUK	Luke	12	52	From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other , three against two and two against three .
NIVUK	Luke	12	53	They will be divided , father against son and son against father , mother against daughter and daughter against mother , mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law. ’ Interpreting the times

NIVUK	Luke	12	56	Hypocrites ! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky . How is it that you don ’ t know how to interpret this present time ?
NIVUK	Luke	12	57	‘ Why don ’ t you judge for yourselves what is right ?
NIVUK	Luke	12	58	As you are going with your adversary to the magistrate , try hard to be reconciled on the way , or your adversary may drag you off to the judge , and the judge turn you over to the officer , and the officer throw you into prison .

NIVUK	Luke	13	13	Then he put his hands on her , and immediately she straightened up and praised God .
NIVUK	Luke	13	2	Jesus answered , ‘ Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way ?
NIVUK	Luke	13	3	I tell you , no ! But unless you repent , you too will all perish .
NIVUK	Luke	13	4	Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them – do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem ?
NIVUK	Luke	13	5	I tell you , no ! But unless you repent , you too will all perish. ’
NIVUK	Luke	13	6	Then he told this parable : ‘ A man had a fig-tree growing in his vineyard , and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any .
NIVUK	Luke	13	7	So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard , “ For three years now I ’ ve been coming to look for fruit on this fig-tree and haven ’ t found any . Cut it down ! Why should it use up the soil ? ”
NIVUK	Luke	13	8	‘ “ Sir , ” the man replied , “ leave it alone for one more year , and I ’ ll dig round it and fertilise it .
NIVUK	Luke	13	9	If it bears fruit next year , fine ! If not , then cut it down. ” ’ Jesus heals a crippled woman on the Sabbath
NIVUK	Luke	13	10	On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues ,
NIVUK	Luke	13	11	and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years . She was bent over and could not straighten up at all .
NIVUK	Luke	13	12	When Jesus saw her , he called her forward and said to her , ‘ Woman , you are set free from your infirmity. ’
NIVUK	Luke	13	14	Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath , the synagogue leader said to the people , ‘ There are six days for work . So come and be healed on those days , not on the Sabbath. ’
NIVUK	Luke	13	15	The Lord answered him , ‘ You hypocrites ! Doesn ’ t each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water ?
NIVUK	Luke	13	16	Then should not this woman , a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years , be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	13	17	When he said this , all his opponents were humiliated , but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing . The parables of the mustard seed and the yeast
NIVUK	Luke	13	18	Then Jesus asked , ‘ What is the kingdom of God like ? What shall I compare it to ?
NIVUK	Luke	13	19	It is like a mustard seed , which a man took and planted in his garden . It grew and became a tree , and the birds perched in its branches. ’
NIVUK	Luke	13	20	Again he asked , ‘ What shall I compare the kingdom of God to ?
NIVUK	Luke	13	21	It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about thirty kilograms of flour until it worked all through the dough. ’ The narrow door
NIVUK	Luke	13	22	Then Jesus went through the towns and villages , teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Luke	13	23	Someone asked him , ‘ Lord , are only a few people going to be saved ? ’ He said to them ,
NIVUK	Luke	13	24	‘ Make every effort to enter through the narrow door , because many , I tell you , will try to enter and will not be able to .
NIVUK	Luke	13	25	Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door , you will stand outside knocking and pleading , “ Sir , open the door for us. ” ‘ But he will answer , “ I don ’ t know you or where you come from. ”
NIVUK	Luke	13	26	‘ Then you will say , “ We ate and drank with you , and you taught in our streets. ”
NIVUK	Luke	13	27	‘ But he will reply , “ I don ’ t know you or where you come from . Away from me , all you evildoers ! ”
NIVUK	Luke	13	28	‘ There will be weeping there , and gnashing of teeth , when you see Abraham , Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God , but you yourselves thrown out .
NIVUK	Luke	13	29	People will come from east and west and north and south , and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God .
NIVUK	Luke	13	30	Indeed there are those who are last who will be first , and first who will be last. ’ Jesus ’ sorrow for Jerusalem
NIVUK	Luke	13	31	At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him , ‘ Leave this place and go somewhere else . Herod wants to kill you. ’
NIVUK	Luke	13	32	He replied , ‘ Go and tell that fox , “ I will keep on driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow , and on the third day I will reach my goal. ”
NIVUK	Luke	13	33	In any case , I must press on today and tomorrow and the next day – for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem !
NIVUK	Luke	13	34	‘ Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you , how often I have longed to gather your children together , as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings , and you were not willing .
NIVUK	Luke	13	35	Look , your house is left to you desolate . I tell you , you will not see me again until you say , “ Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. ” [ a ] ’ Footnotes - Luke 13:35 Psalm 118:26 Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Luke	14	14	and you will be blessed . Although they can not repay you , you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous. ’ The parable of the great banquet
NIVUK	Luke	14	2	There in front of him was a man suffering from abnormal swelling of his body .
NIVUK	Luke	14	3	Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law , ‘ Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	14	4	But they remained silent . So taking hold of the man , he healed him and sent him on his way .
NIVUK	Luke	14	5	Then he asked them , ‘ If one of you has a child [ a ] or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day , will you not immediately pull it out ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	14	6	And they had nothing to say .
NIVUK	Luke	14	7	When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honour at the table , he told them this parable :
NIVUK	Luke	14	8	‘ When someone invites you to a wedding feast , do not take the place of honour , for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited .
NIVUK	Luke	14	9	If so , the host who invited both of you will come and say to you , “ Give this person your seat. ” Then , humiliated , you will have to take the least important place .
NIVUK	Luke	14	10	But when you are invited , take the lowest place , so that when your host comes , he will say to you , “ Friend , move up to a better place. ” Then you will be honoured in the presence of all the other guests .
NIVUK	Luke	14	11	For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled , and those who humble themselves will be exalted. ’
NIVUK	Luke	14	12	Then Jesus said to his host , ‘ When you give a luncheon or dinner , do not invite your friends , your brothers or sisters , your relatives , or your rich neighbours ; if you do , they may invite you back and so you will be repaid .
NIVUK	Luke	14	13	But when you give a banquet , invite the poor , the crippled , the lame , the blind ,
NIVUK	Luke	14	15	When one of those at the table with him heard this , he said to Jesus , ‘ Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God. ’
NIVUK	Luke	14	16	Jesus replied : ‘ A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests .
NIVUK	Luke	14	17	At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited , “ Come , for everything is now ready. ”
NIVUK	Luke	14	18	‘ But they all alike began to make excuses . The first said , “ I have just bought a field , and I must go and see it . Please excuse me. ”
NIVUK	Luke	14	19	‘ Another said , “ I have just bought five yoke of oxen , and I ’ m on my way to try them out . Please excuse me. ”
NIVUK	Luke	14	20	‘ Still another said , “ I have just got married , so I can ’ t come. ”
NIVUK	Luke	14	21	‘ The servant came back and reported this to his master . Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant , “ Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor , the crippled , the blind and the lame. ”
NIVUK	Luke	14	22	‘ “ Sir , ” the servant said , “ what you ordered has been done , but there is still room. ”
NIVUK	Luke	14	23	‘ Then the master told his servant , “ Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in , so that my house will be full .
NIVUK	Luke	14	24	I tell you , not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet. ” ’ The cost of being a disciple
NIVUK	Luke	14	25	Large crowds were travelling with Jesus , and turning to them he said :
NIVUK	Luke	14	26	‘ If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother , wife and children , brothers and sisters – yes , even their own life – such a person can not be my disciple .
NIVUK	Luke	14	27	And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me can not be my disciple .
NIVUK	Luke	14	28	‘ Suppose one of you wants to build a tower . Won ’ t you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it ?
NIVUK	Luke	14	29	For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it , everyone who sees it will ridicule you ,
NIVUK	Luke	14	30	saying , “ This person began to build and wasn ’ t able to finish. ”
NIVUK	Luke	14	31	‘ Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king . Won ’ t he first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand ?
NIVUK	Luke	14	32	If he is not able , he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace .
NIVUK	Luke	14	33	In the same way , those of you who do not give up everything you have can not be my disciples .
NIVUK	Luke	14	34	‘ Salt is good , but if it loses its saltiness , how can it be made salty again ?
NIVUK	Luke	14	35	It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure heap ; it is thrown out . ‘ Whoever has ears to hear , let them hear. ’ Footnotes - Luke 14:5 Some manuscripts donkey Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Luke	15	15	So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country , who sent him to his fields to feed pigs .
NIVUK	Luke	15	2	But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered , ‘ This man welcomes sinners , and eats with them. ’
NIVUK	Luke	15	3	Then Jesus told them this parable :
NIVUK	Luke	15	4	‘ Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them . Doesn ’ t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it ?
NIVUK	Luke	15	5	And when he finds it , he joyfully puts it on his shoulders
NIVUK	Luke	15	6	and goes home . Then he calls his friends and neighbours together and says , “ Rejoice with me ; I have found my lost sheep. ”
NIVUK	Luke	15	7	I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who do not need to repent . The parable of the lost coin
NIVUK	Luke	15	8	‘ Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins [ a ] and loses one . Doesn ’ t she light a lamp , sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it ?
NIVUK	Luke	15	9	And when she finds it , she calls her friends and neighbours together and says , “ Rejoice with me ; I have found my lost coin. ”
NIVUK	Luke	15	10	In the same way , I tell you , there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents. ’ The parable of the lost son
NIVUK	Luke	15	11	Jesus continued : ‘ There was a man who had two sons .
NIVUK	Luke	15	12	The younger one said to his father , “ Father , give me my share of the estate. ” So he divided his property between them .
NIVUK	Luke	15	13	‘ Not long after that , the younger son got together all he had , set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living .
NIVUK	Luke	15	14	After he had spent everything , there was a severe famine in that whole country , and he began to be in need .
NIVUK	Luke	15	16	He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating , but no one gave him anything .
NIVUK	Luke	15	17	‘ When he came to his senses , he said , “ How many of my father ’ s hired servants have food to spare , and here I am starving to death !
NIVUK	Luke	15	18	I will set out and go back to my father and say to him : Father , I have sinned against heaven and against you .
NIVUK	Luke	15	19	I am no longer worthy to be called your son ; make me like one of your hired servants. ”
NIVUK	Luke	15	20	So he got up and went to his father . ‘ But while he was still a long way off , his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him ; he ran to his son , threw his arms round him and kissed him .
NIVUK	Luke	15	21	‘ The son said to him , “ Father , I have sinned against heaven and against you . I am no longer worthy to be called your son. ”
NIVUK	Luke	15	22	‘ But the father said to his servants , “ Quick ! Bring the best robe and put it on him . Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet .
NIVUK	Luke	15	23	Bring the fattened calf and kill it . Let ’ s have a feast and celebrate .
NIVUK	Luke	15	24	For this son of mine was dead and is alive again ; he was lost and is found. ” So they began to celebrate .
NIVUK	Luke	15	25	‘ Meanwhile , the elder son was in the field . When he came near the house , he heard music and dancing .
NIVUK	Luke	15	26	So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on .
NIVUK	Luke	15	27	“ Your brother has come , ” he replied , “ and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound. ”
NIVUK	Luke	15	28	‘ The elder brother became angry and refused to go in . So his father went out and pleaded with him .
NIVUK	Luke	15	29	But he answered his father , “ Look ! All these years I ’ ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders . Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends .
NIVUK	Luke	15	30	But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home , you kill the fattened calf for him ! ”
NIVUK	Luke	15	31	‘ “ My son , ” the father said , “ you are always with me , and everything I have is yours .
NIVUK	Luke	15	32	But we had to celebrate and be glad , because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again ; he was lost and is found. ” ’ Footnotes - Luke 15:8 Greek ten drachmas , each worth about a day ’ s wages Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Luke	16	16	‘ The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John . Since that time , the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached , and everyone is forcing their way into it .
NIVUK	Luke	16	2	So he called him in and asked him , “ What is this I hear about you ? Give an account of your management , because you can not be manager any longer. ”
NIVUK	Luke	16	3	‘ The manager said to himself , “ What shall I do now ? My master is taking away my job . I ’ m not strong enough to dig , and I ’ m ashamed to beg –
NIVUK	Luke	16	4	I know what I ’ ll do so that , when I lose my job here , people will welcome me into their houses. ”
NIVUK	Luke	16	5	‘ So he called in each one of his master ’ s debtors . He asked the first , “ How much do you owe my master ? ”
NIVUK	Luke	16	6	‘ “ Three thousand litres of olive oil , ” he replied . ‘ The manager told him , “ Take your bill , sit down quickly , and make it fifteen hundred. ”
NIVUK	Luke	16	7	‘ Then he asked the second , “ And how much do you owe ? ” ‘ “ Thirty tons of wheat , ” he replied . ‘ He told him , “ Take your bill and make it twenty-four. ”
NIVUK	Luke	16	8	‘ The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly . For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light .
NIVUK	Luke	16	9	I tell you , use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves , so that when it is gone , you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings .
NIVUK	Luke	16	10	‘ Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much , and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much .
NIVUK	Luke	16	11	So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth , who will trust you with true riches ?
NIVUK	Luke	16	12	And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else ’ s property , who will give you property of your own ?
NIVUK	Luke	16	13	‘ No one can serve two masters . Either you will hate the one and love the other , or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other . You can not serve both God and Money. ’
NIVUK	Luke	16	14	The Pharisees , who loved money , heard all this and were sneering at Jesus .
NIVUK	Luke	16	15	He said to them , ‘ You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others , but God knows your hearts . What people value highly is detestable in God ’ s sight . Additional teachings
NIVUK	Luke	16	17	It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law .
NIVUK	Luke	16	18	‘ Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery , and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery . The rich man and Lazarus
NIVUK	Luke	16	19	‘ There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day .
NIVUK	Luke	16	20	At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus , covered with sores
NIVUK	Luke	16	21	and longing to eat what fell from the rich man ’ s table . Even the dogs came and licked his sores .
NIVUK	Luke	16	22	‘ The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham ’ s side . The rich man also died and was buried .
NIVUK	Luke	16	23	In Hades , where he was in torment , he looked up and saw Abraham far away , with Lazarus by his side .
NIVUK	Luke	16	24	So he called to him , “ Father Abraham , have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue , because I am in agony in this fire. ”
NIVUK	Luke	16	25	‘ But Abraham replied , “ Son , remember that in your lifetime you received your good things , while Lazarus received bad things , but now he is comforted here and you are in agony .
NIVUK	Luke	16	26	And besides all this , between us and you a great chasm has been set in place , so that those who want to go from here to you can not , nor can anyone cross over from there to us. ”
NIVUK	Luke	16	27	‘ He answered , “ Then I beg you , father , send Lazarus to my family ,
NIVUK	Luke	16	28	for I have five brothers . Let him warn them , so that they will not also come to this place of torment. ”
NIVUK	Luke	16	29	‘ Abraham replied , “ They have Moses and the Prophets ; let them listen to them. ”
NIVUK	Luke	16	30	‘ “ No , father Abraham , ” he said , “ but if someone from the dead goes to them , they will repent. ”
NIVUK	Luke	16	31	‘ He said to him , “ If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets , they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead. ” ’ Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Luke	17	17	Jesus asked , ‘ Were not all ten cleansed ? Where are the other nine ?
NIVUK	Luke	17	2	It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied round their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble .
NIVUK	Luke	17	3	So watch yourselves . ‘ If your brother or sister [ a ] sins against you , rebuke them ; and if they repent , forgive them .
NIVUK	Luke	17	4	Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back to you saying “ I repent , ” you must forgive them. ’
NIVUK	Luke	17	5	The apostles said to the Lord , ‘ Increase our faith ! ’
NIVUK	Luke	17	6	He replied , ‘ If you have faith as small as a mustard seed , you can say to this mulberry tree , “ Be uprooted and planted in the sea , ” and it will obey you .
NIVUK	Luke	17	7	‘ Suppose one of you has a servant ploughing or looking after the sheep . Will he say to the servant when he comes in from the field , “ Come along now and sit down to eat ” ?
NIVUK	Luke	17	8	Won ’ t he rather say , “ Prepare my supper , get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink ; after that you may eat and drink ” ?
NIVUK	Luke	17	9	Will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do ?
NIVUK	Luke	17	10	So you also , when you have done everything you were told to do , should say , “ We are unworthy servants ; we have only done our duty. ” ’ Jesus heals ten men with leprosy
NIVUK	Luke	17	11	Now on his way to Jerusalem , Jesus travelled along the border between Samaria and Galilee .
NIVUK	Luke	17	12	As he was going into a village , ten men who had leprosy [ b ] met him . They stood at a distance
NIVUK	Luke	17	13	and called out in a loud voice , ‘ Jesus , Master , have pity on us ! ’
NIVUK	Luke	17	14	When he saw them , he said , ‘ Go , show yourselves to the priests. ’ And as they went , they were cleansed .
NIVUK	Luke	17	15	One of them , when he saw he was healed , came back , praising God in a loud voice .
NIVUK	Luke	17	16	He threw himself at Jesus ’ feet and thanked him – and he was a Samaritan .
NIVUK	Luke	17	18	Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	17	19	Then he said to him , ‘ Rise and go ; your faith has made you well. ’ The coming of the kingdom of God
NIVUK	Luke	17	20	Once , on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come , Jesus replied , ‘ The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed ,
NIVUK	Luke	17	21	nor will people say , “ Here it is , ” or “ There it is , ” because the kingdom of God is in your midst. ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	Luke	17	22	Then he said to his disciples , ‘ The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man , but you will not see it .
NIVUK	Luke	17	23	People will tell you , “ There he is ! ” or “ Here he is ! ” Do not go running off after them .
NIVUK	Luke	17	24	For the Son of Man in his day [ d ] will be like the lightning , which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other .
NIVUK	Luke	17	25	But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation .
NIVUK	Luke	17	26	‘ Just as it was in the days of Noah , so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man .
NIVUK	Luke	17	27	People were eating , drinking , marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark . Then the flood came and destroyed them all .
NIVUK	Luke	17	28	‘ It was the same in the days of Lot . People were eating and drinking , buying and selling , planting and building .
NIVUK	Luke	17	29	But the day Lot left Sodom , fire and sulphur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all .
NIVUK	Luke	17	30	‘ It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed .
NIVUK	Luke	17	31	On that day no one who is on the housetop , with possessions inside , should go down to get them . Likewise , no one in the field should go back for anything .
NIVUK	Luke	17	32	Remember Lot ’ s wife !
NIVUK	Luke	17	33	Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it , and whoever loses their life will preserve it .
NIVUK	Luke	17	34	I tell you , on that night two people will be in one bed ; one will be taken and the other left .
NIVUK	Luke	17	35	Two women will be grinding corn together ; one will be taken and the other left. ’
NIVUK	Luke	17	37	‘ Where , Lord ? ’ they asked . He replied , ‘ Where there is a dead body , there the vultures will gather. ’ Footnotes - Luke 17:3 The Greek word for brother or sister ( adelphos ) refers here to a fellow disciple , whether man or woman . - Luke 17:12 The Greek word traditionally translated leprosy was used for various diseases affecting the skin . - Luke 17:21 Or is within you - Luke 17:24 Some manuscripts do not have in his day . - Luke 17:36 Some manuscripts include here words similar to Matt . 24:40 .

NIVUK	Luke	18	18	A certain ruler asked him , ‘ Good teacher , what must I do to inherit eternal life ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	18	2	He said : ‘ In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought .
NIVUK	Luke	18	3	And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea , “ Grant me justice against my adversary. ”
NIVUK	Luke	18	4	‘ For some time he refused . But finally he said to himself , “ Even though I don ’ t fear God or care what people think ,
NIVUK	Luke	18	5	yet because this widow keeps bothering me , I will see that she gets justice , so that she won ’ t eventually come and attack me ! ” ’
NIVUK	Luke	18	6	And the Lord said , ‘ Listen to what the unjust judge says .

NIVUK	Luke	18	9	To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else , Jesus told this parable :
NIVUK	Luke	18	10	‘ Two men went up to the temple to pray , one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector .
NIVUK	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed : “ God , I thank you that I am not like other people – robbers , evildoers , adulterers – or even like this tax collector .
NIVUK	Luke	18	12	I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get. ”
NIVUK	Luke	18	13	‘ But the tax collector stood at a distance . He would not even look up to heaven , but beat his breast and said , “ God , have mercy on me , a sinner. ”
NIVUK	Luke	18	14	‘ I tell you that this man , rather than the other , went home justified before God . For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled , and those who humble themselves will be exalted. ’ The little children and Jesus
NIVUK	Luke	18	15	People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them . When the disciples saw this , they rebuked them .
NIVUK	Luke	18	16	But Jesus called the children to him and said , ‘ Let the little children come to me , and do not hinder them , for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
NIVUK	Luke	18	17	Truly I tell you , anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it. ’ The rich and the kingdom of God
NIVUK	Luke	18	19	‘ Why do you call me good ? ’ Jesus answered . ‘ No one is good – except God alone .
NIVUK	Luke	18	20	You know the commandments : “ You shall not commit adultery , you shall not murder , you shall not steal , you shall not give false testimony , honour your father and mother. ” [ a ] ’
NIVUK	Luke	18	21	‘ All these I have kept since I was a boy , ’ he said .
NIVUK	Luke	18	22	When Jesus heard this , he said to him , ‘ You still lack one thing . Sell everything you have and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come , follow me. ’
NIVUK	Luke	18	23	When he heard this , he became very sad , because he was very wealthy .
NIVUK	Luke	18	24	Jesus looked at him and said , ‘ How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God !
NIVUK	Luke	18	25	Indeed , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God. ’
NIVUK	Luke	18	26	Those who heard this asked , ‘ Who then can be saved ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	18	27	Jesus replied , ‘ What is impossible with man is possible with God. ’
NIVUK	Luke	18	28	Peter said to him , ‘ We have left all we had to follow you ! ’
NIVUK	Luke	18	29	‘ Truly I tell you , ’ Jesus said to them , ‘ no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
NIVUK	Luke	18	30	will fail to receive many times as much in this age , and in the age to come eternal life. ’ Jesus predicts his death a third time
NIVUK	Luke	18	31	Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them , ‘ We are going up to Jerusalem , and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled .
NIVUK	Luke	18	32	He will be handed over to the Gentiles . They will mock him , insult him and spit on him ;
NIVUK	Luke	18	33	they will flog him and kill him . On the third day he will rise again. ’
NIVUK	Luke	18	34	The disciples did not understand any of this . Its meaning was hidden from them , and they did not know what he was talking about . A blind beggar receives his sight
NIVUK	Luke	18	35	As Jesus approached Jericho , a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging .
NIVUK	Luke	18	36	When he heard the crowd going by , he asked what was happening .
NIVUK	Luke	18	37	They told him , ‘ Jesus of Nazareth is passing by. ’
NIVUK	Luke	18	38	He called out , ‘ Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! ’
NIVUK	Luke	18	39	Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet , but he shouted all the more , ‘ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ’
NIVUK	Luke	18	40	Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him . When he came near , Jesus asked him ,
NIVUK	Luke	18	41	‘ What do you want me to do for you ? ’ ‘ Lord , I want to see , ’ he replied .
NIVUK	Luke	18	42	Jesus said to him , ‘ Receive your sight ; your faith has healed you. ’
NIVUK	Luke	18	43	Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus , praising God . When all the people saw it , they also praised God . Footnotes - Luke 18:20 Exodus 20:12-16 ; Deut . 5:16-20 Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Luke	19	19	‘ His master answered , “ You take charge of five cities. ”
NIVUK	Luke	19	2	A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus ; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy .
NIVUK	Luke	19	3	He wanted to see who Jesus was , but because he was short he could not see over the crowd .
NIVUK	Luke	19	4	So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him , since Jesus was coming that way .
NIVUK	Luke	19	5	When Jesus reached the spot , he looked up and said to him , ‘ Zacchaeus , come down immediately . I must stay at your house today. ’
NIVUK	Luke	19	6	So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly .
NIVUK	Luke	19	7	All the people saw this and began to mutter , ‘ He has gone to be the guest of a sinner. ’
NIVUK	Luke	19	8	But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord , ‘ Look , Lord ! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor , and if I have cheated anybody out of anything , I will pay back four times the amount. ’
NIVUK	Luke	19	9	Jesus said to him , ‘ Today salvation has come to this house , because this man , too , is a son of Abraham .
NIVUK	Luke	19	10	For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost. ’ The parable of the ten minas
NIVUK	Luke	19	11	While they were listening to this , he went on to tell them a parable , because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once .
NIVUK	Luke	19	12	He said : ‘ A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return .
NIVUK	Luke	19	13	So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas . [ a ] “ Put this money to work , ” he said , “ until I come back. ”
NIVUK	Luke	19	14	‘ But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say , “ We don ’ t want this man to be our king. ”
NIVUK	Luke	19	15	‘ He was made king , however , and returned home . Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money , in order to find out what they had gained with it .
NIVUK	Luke	19	16	‘ The first one came and said , “ Sir , your mina has earned ten more. ”
NIVUK	Luke	19	17	‘ “ Well done , my good servant ! ” his master replied . “ Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter , take charge of ten cities. ”
NIVUK	Luke	19	18	‘ The second came and said , “ Sir , your mina has earned five more. ”
NIVUK	Luke	19	20	‘ Then another servant came and said , “ Sir , here is your mina ; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth .
NIVUK	Luke	19	21	I was afraid of you , because you are a hard man . You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow. ”
NIVUK	Luke	19	22	‘ His master replied , “ I will judge you by your own words , you wicked servant ! You knew , did you , that I am a hard man , taking out what I did not put in , and reaping what I did not sow ?
NIVUK	Luke	19	23	Why then didn ’ t you put my money on deposit , so that when I came back , I could have collected it with interest ? ”
NIVUK	Luke	19	24	‘ Then he said to those standing by , “ Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas. ”
NIVUK	Luke	19	25	‘ “ Sir , ” they said , “ he already has ten ! ”
NIVUK	Luke	19	26	‘ He replied , “ I tell you that to everyone who has , more will be given , but as for the one who has nothing , even what they have will be taken away .
NIVUK	Luke	19	27	But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them – bring them here and kill them in front of me. ” ’ Jesus comes to Jerusalem as king
NIVUK	Luke	19	28	After Jesus had said this , he went on ahead , going up to Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Luke	19	29	As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples , saying to them ,
NIVUK	Luke	19	30	‘ Go to the village ahead of you , and as you enter it , you will find a colt tied there , which no one has ever ridden . Untie it and bring it here .
NIVUK	Luke	19	31	If anyone asks you , “ Why are you untying it ? ” say , “ The Lord needs it. ” ’
NIVUK	Luke	19	32	Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them .
NIVUK	Luke	19	33	As they were untying the colt , its owners asked them , ‘ Why are you untying the colt ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	19	34	They replied , ‘ The Lord needs it. ’
NIVUK	Luke	19	35	They brought it to Jesus , threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it .
NIVUK	Luke	19	36	As he went along , people spread their cloaks on the road .
NIVUK	Luke	19	37	When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives , the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen :
NIVUK	Luke	19	38	‘ Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord ! ’ [ b ] ‘ Peace in heaven and glory in the highest ! ’
NIVUK	Luke	19	39	Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus , ‘ Teacher , rebuke your disciples ! ’
NIVUK	Luke	19	40	‘ I tell you , ’ he replied , ‘ if they keep quiet , the stones will cry out. ’
NIVUK	Luke	19	41	As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city , he wept over it
NIVUK	Luke	19	42	and said , ‘ If you , even you , had only known on this day what would bring you peace – but now it is hidden from your eyes .
NIVUK	Luke	19	43	The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side .
NIVUK	Luke	19	44	They will dash you to the ground , you and the children within your walls . They will not leave one stone on another , because you did not recognise the time of God ’ s coming to you. ’ Jesus at the temple
NIVUK	Luke	19	45	When Jesus entered the temple courts , he began to drive out those who were selling .
NIVUK	Luke	19	46	‘ It is written , ’ he said to them , ‘ “ My house will be a house of prayer ” [ c ] ; but you have made it “ a den of robbers ” . [ d ] ’
NIVUK	Luke	19	47	Every day he was teaching at the temple . But the chief priests , the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him .
NIVUK	Luke	19	48	Yet they could not find any way to do it , because all the people hung on his words .

NIVUK	Luke	20	20	Keeping a close watch on him , they sent spies , who pretended to be sincere . They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said , so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor .
NIVUK	Luke	20	2	‘ Tell us by what authority you are doing these things , ’ they said . ‘ Who gave you this authority ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	20	3	He replied , ‘ I will also ask you a question . Tell me :
NIVUK	Luke	20	4	John ’ s baptism – was it from heaven , or of human origin ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	20	5	They discussed it among themselves and said , ‘ If we say , “ From heaven , ” he will ask , “ Why didn ’ t you believe him ? ”
NIVUK	Luke	20	6	But if we say , “ Of human origin , ” all the people will stone us , because they are persuaded that John was a prophet. ’
NIVUK	Luke	20	7	So they answered , ‘ We don ’ t know where it was from. ’
NIVUK	Luke	20	8	Jesus said , ‘ Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things. ’ The parable of the tenants
NIVUK	Luke	20	9	He went on to tell the people this parable : ‘ A man planted a vineyard , rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time .
NIVUK	Luke	20	10	At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard . But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed .
NIVUK	Luke	20	11	He sent another servant , but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed .
NIVUK	Luke	20	12	He sent still a third , and they wounded him and threw him out .
NIVUK	Luke	20	13	‘ Then the owner of the vineyard said , “ What shall I do ? I will send my son , whom I love ; perhaps they will respect him. ”
NIVUK	Luke	20	14	‘ But when the tenants saw him , they talked the matter over . “ This is the heir , ” they said . “ Let ’ s kill him , and the inheritance will be ours. ”
NIVUK	Luke	20	15	So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him . ‘ What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
NIVUK	Luke	20	16	He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others. ’ When the people heard this , they said , ‘ God forbid ! ’
NIVUK	Luke	20	17	Jesus looked directly at them and asked , ‘ Then what is the meaning of that which is written : ‘ “ The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ” [ a ] ?
NIVUK	Luke	20	18	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces ; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed. ’
NIVUK	Luke	20	19	The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately , because they knew he had spoken this parable against them . But they were afraid of the people . Paying taxes to Caesar
NIVUK	Luke	20	21	So the spies questioned him : ‘ Teacher , we know that you speak and teach what is right , and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth .
NIVUK	Luke	20	22	Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	20	23	He saw through their duplicity and said to them ,
NIVUK	Luke	20	24	‘ Show me a denarius . Whose image and inscription are on it ? ’ ‘ Caesar ’ s , ’ they replied .
NIVUK	Luke	20	25	He said to them , ‘ Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar ’ s , and to God what is God ’ s. ’
NIVUK	Luke	20	26	They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public . And astonished by his answer , they became silent . The resurrection and marriage
NIVUK	Luke	20	27	Some of the Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection , came to Jesus with a question .
NIVUK	Luke	20	28	‘ Teacher , ’ they said , ‘ Moses wrote for us that if a man ’ s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children , the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother .
NIVUK	Luke	20	29	Now there were seven brothers . The first one married a woman and died childless .
NIVUK	Luke	20	30	The second
NIVUK	Luke	20	31	and then the third married her , and in the same way the seven died , leaving no children .
NIVUK	Luke	20	32	Finally , the woman died too .
NIVUK	Luke	20	33	Now then , at the resurrection whose wife will she be , since the seven were married to her ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	20	34	Jesus replied , ‘ The people of this age marry and are given in marriage .
NIVUK	Luke	20	35	But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage ,
NIVUK	Luke	20	36	and they can no longer die ; for they are like the angels . They are God ’ s children , since they are children of the resurrection .
NIVUK	Luke	20	37	But in the account of the burning bush , even Moses showed that the dead rise , for he calls the Lord “ the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ” . [ b ]
NIVUK	Luke	20	38	He is not the God of the dead , but of the living , for to him all are alive. ’
NIVUK	Luke	20	39	Some of the teachers of the law responded , ‘ Well said , teacher ! ’
NIVUK	Luke	20	40	And no one dared to ask him any more questions . Whose son is the Messiah ?
NIVUK	Luke	20	41	Then Jesus said to them , ‘ Why is it said that the Messiah is the son of David ?
NIVUK	Luke	20	42	David himself declares in the Book of Psalms : ‘ “ The Lord said to my Lord : ‘ Sit at my right hand
NIVUK	Luke	20	43	until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet. ’ ” [ c ]
NIVUK	Luke	20	44	David calls him “ Lord. ” How then can he be his son ? ’ Warning against the teachers of the law
NIVUK	Luke	20	45	While all the people were listening , Jesus said to his disciples ,
NIVUK	Luke	20	46	‘ Beware of the teachers of the law . They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted with respect in the market-places and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honour at banquets .
NIVUK	Luke	20	47	They devour widows ’ houses and for a show make lengthy prayers . These men will be punished most severely. ’ Footnotes - Luke 20:17 Psalm 118:22 - Luke 20:37 Exodus 3:6 - Luke 20:43 Psalm 110:1 Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Luke	21	21	Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains , let those in the city get out , and let those in the country not enter the city .
NIVUK	Luke	21	2	He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins .
NIVUK	Luke	21	3	‘ Truly I tell you , ’ he said , ‘ this poor widow has put in more than all the others .
NIVUK	Luke	21	4	All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth ; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on. ’ The destruction of the temple and signs of the end times
NIVUK	Luke	21	5	Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God . But Jesus said ,
NIVUK	Luke	21	6	‘ As for what you see here , the time will come when not one stone will be left on another ; every one of them will be thrown down. ’
NIVUK	Luke	21	7	‘ Teacher , ’ they asked , ‘ when will these things happen ? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	21	8	He replied : ‘ Watch out that you are not deceived . For many will come in my name , claiming , “ I am he , ” and , “ The time is near. ” Do not follow them .
NIVUK	Luke	21	9	When you hear of wars and uprisings , do not be frightened . These things must happen first , but the end will not come right away. ’
NIVUK	Luke	21	10	Then he said to them : ‘ Nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom .
NIVUK	Luke	21	11	There will be great earthquakes , famines and pestilences in various places , and fearful events and great signs from heaven .
NIVUK	Luke	21	12	‘ But before all this , they will seize you and persecute you . They will hand you over to synagogues and put you in prison , and you will be brought before kings and governors , and all on account of my name .
NIVUK	Luke	21	13	And so you will bear testimony to me .
NIVUK	Luke	21	14	But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves .
NIVUK	Luke	21	15	For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict .
NIVUK	Luke	21	16	You will be betrayed even by parents , brothers and sisters , relatives and friends , and they will put some of you to death .
NIVUK	Luke	21	17	Everyone will hate you because of me .
NIVUK	Luke	21	18	But not a hair of your head will perish .
NIVUK	Luke	21	19	Stand firm , and you will win life .
NIVUK	Luke	21	20	‘ When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies , you will know that its desolation is near .
NIVUK	Luke	21	22	For this is the time of punishment in fulfilment of all that has been written .
NIVUK	Luke	21	23	How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers ! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people .
NIVUK	Luke	21	24	They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations . Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled .
NIVUK	Luke	21	25	‘ There will be signs in the sun , moon and stars . On the earth , nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea .
NIVUK	Luke	21	26	People will faint from terror , apprehensive of what is coming on the world , for the heavenly bodies will be shaken .
NIVUK	Luke	21	27	At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
NIVUK	Luke	21	28	When these things begin to take place , stand up and lift up your heads , because your redemption is drawing near. ’
NIVUK	Luke	21	29	He told them this parable : ‘ Look at the fig-tree and all the trees .
NIVUK	Luke	21	30	When they sprout leaves , you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near .
NIVUK	Luke	21	31	Even so , when you see these things happening , you know that the kingdom of God is near .
NIVUK	Luke	21	32	‘ Truly I tell you , this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened .
NIVUK	Luke	21	33	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will never pass away .
NIVUK	Luke	21	34	‘ Be careful , or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing , drunkenness and the anxieties of life , and that day will close on you suddenly like a trap .
NIVUK	Luke	21	35	For it will come on all those who live on the face of the whole earth .
NIVUK	Luke	21	36	Be always on the watch , and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen , and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man. ’
NIVUK	Luke	21	37	Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple , and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives ,

NIVUK	Luke	22	22	The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed . But woe to that man who betrays him ! ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	2	and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus , for they were afraid of the people .
NIVUK	Luke	22	3	Then Satan entered Judas , called Iscariot , one of the Twelve .
NIVUK	Luke	22	4	And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus .
NIVUK	Luke	22	5	They were delighted and agreed to give him money .
NIVUK	Luke	22	6	He consented , and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present . The Last Supper
NIVUK	Luke	22	7	Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed .
NIVUK	Luke	22	8	Jesus sent Peter and John , saying , ‘ Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover. ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	9	‘ Where do you want us to prepare for it ? ’ they asked .
NIVUK	Luke	22	10	He replied , ‘ As you enter the city , a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him to the house that he enters ,
NIVUK	Luke	22	11	and say to the owner of the house , “ The Teacher asks : where is the guest room , where I may eat the Passover with my disciples ? ”
NIVUK	Luke	22	12	He will show you a large room upstairs , all furnished . Make preparations there. ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	13	They left and found things just as Jesus had told them . So they prepared the Passover .
NIVUK	Luke	22	14	When the hour came , Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table .
NIVUK	Luke	22	15	And he said to them , ‘ I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer .
NIVUK	Luke	22	16	For I tell you , I will not eat it again until it finds fulfilment in the kingdom of God. ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	17	After taking the cup , he gave thanks and said , ‘ Take this and divide it among you .
NIVUK	Luke	22	18	For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes. ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	19	And he took bread , gave thanks and broke it , and gave it to them , saying , ‘ This is my body given for you ; do this in remembrance of me. ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	20	In the same way , after the supper he took the cup , saying , ‘ This cup is the new covenant in my blood , which is poured out for you . [ a ]
NIVUK	Luke	22	21	But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table .
NIVUK	Luke	22	23	They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this .
NIVUK	Luke	22	24	A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest .
NIVUK	Luke	22	25	Jesus said to them , ‘ The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them ; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors .
NIVUK	Luke	22	26	But you are not to be like that . Instead , the greatest among you should be like the youngest , and the one who rules like the one who serves .
NIVUK	Luke	22	27	For who is greater , the one who is at the table or the one who serves ? Is it not the one who is at the table ? But I am among you as one who serves .
NIVUK	Luke	22	28	You are those who have stood by me in my trials .
NIVUK	Luke	22	29	And I confer on you a kingdom , just as my Father conferred one on me ,
NIVUK	Luke	22	30	so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
NIVUK	Luke	22	31	‘ Simon , Simon , Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat .
NIVUK	Luke	22	32	But I have prayed for you , Simon , that your faith may not fail . And when you have turned back , strengthen your brothers. ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	33	But he replied , ‘ Lord , I am ready to go with you to prison and to death. ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	34	Jesus answered , ‘ I tell you , Peter , before the cock crows today , you will deny three times that you know me. ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	35	Then Jesus asked them , ‘ When I sent you without purse , bag or sandals , did you lack anything ? ’ ‘ Nothing , ’ they answered .
NIVUK	Luke	22	36	He said to them , ‘ But now if you have a purse , take it , and also a bag ; and if you don ’ t have a sword , sell your cloak and buy one .
NIVUK	Luke	22	37	It is written : “ And he was numbered with the transgressors ” [ b ] ; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me . Yes , what is written about me is reaching its fulfilment. ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	38	The disciples said , ‘ See , Lord , here are two swords. ’ ‘ That ’ s enough ! ’ he replied . Jesus prays on the Mount of Olives
NIVUK	Luke	22	39	Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives , and his disciples followed him .
NIVUK	Luke	22	40	On reaching the place , he said to them , ‘ Pray that you will not fall into temptation. ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	41	He withdrew about a stone ’ s throw beyond them , knelt down and prayed ,
NIVUK	Luke	22	42	‘ Father , if you are willing , take this cup from me ; yet not my will , but yours be done. ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	43	and
NIVUK	Luke	22	44	. Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	Luke	22	45	When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples , he found them asleep , exhausted from sorrow .
NIVUK	Luke	22	46	‘ Why are you sleeping ? ’ he asked them . ‘ Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. ’ Jesus arrested
NIVUK	Luke	22	47	While he was still speaking a crowd came up , and the man who was called Judas , one of the Twelve , was leading them . He approached Jesus to kiss him ,
NIVUK	Luke	22	48	but Jesus asked him , ‘ Judas , are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	49	When Jesus ’ followers saw what was going to happen , they said , ‘ Lord , should we strike with our swords ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	50	And one of them struck the servant of the high priest , cutting off his right ear .
NIVUK	Luke	22	51	But Jesus answered , ‘ No more of this ! ’ And he touched the man ’ s ear and healed him .
NIVUK	Luke	22	52	Then Jesus said to the chief priests , the officers of the temple guard , and the elders , who had come for him , ‘ Am I leading a rebellion , that you have come with swords and clubs ?
NIVUK	Luke	22	53	Every day I was with you in the temple courts , and you did not lay a hand on me . But this is your hour – when darkness reigns. ’ Peter disowns Jesus
NIVUK	Luke	22	54	Then seizing him , they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest . Peter followed at a distance .
NIVUK	Luke	22	55	And when some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together , Peter sat down with them .
NIVUK	Luke	22	56	A servant-girl saw him seated there in the firelight . She looked closely at him and said , ‘ This man was with him. ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	57	But he denied it . ‘ Woman , I don ’ t know him , ’ he said .
NIVUK	Luke	22	58	A little later someone else saw him and said , ‘ You also are one of them. ’ ‘ Man , I am not ! ’ Peter replied .
NIVUK	Luke	22	59	About an hour later another asserted , ‘ Certainly this fellow was with him , for he is a Galilean. ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	60	Peter replied , ‘ Man , I don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about ! ’ Just as he was speaking , the cock crowed .
NIVUK	Luke	22	61	The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter . Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him : ‘ Before the cock crows today , you will disown me three times. ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	62	And he went outside and wept bitterly . The guards mock Jesus
NIVUK	Luke	22	63	The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him .
NIVUK	Luke	22	64	They blindfolded him and demanded , ‘ Prophesy ! Who hit you ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	65	And they said many other insulting things to him . Jesus before Pilate and Herod
NIVUK	Luke	22	66	At daybreak the council of the elders of the people , both the chief priests and the teachers of the law , met together , and Jesus was led before them .
NIVUK	Luke	22	67	‘ If you are the Messiah , ’ they said , ‘ tell us. ’ Jesus answered , ‘ If I tell you , you will not believe me ,
NIVUK	Luke	22	68	and if I asked you , you would not answer .
NIVUK	Luke	22	69	But from now on , the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God. ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	70	They all asked , ‘ Are you then the Son of God ? ’ He replied , ‘ You say that I am. ’
NIVUK	Luke	22	71	Then they said , ‘ Why do we need any more testimony ? We have heard it from his own lips. ’ Footnotes - Luke 22:20 Some manuscripts do not have given for you . . . poured out for you . - Luke 22:37 Isaiah 53:12 - Luke 22:44 Many early manuscripts do not have verses

NIVUK	Luke	23	23	But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified , and their shouts prevailed .
NIVUK	Luke	23	2	And they began to accuse him , saying , ‘ We have found this man subverting our nation . He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Messiah , a king. ’
NIVUK	Luke	23	3	So Pilate asked Jesus , ‘ Are you the king of the Jews ? ’ ‘ You have said so , ’ Jesus replied .
NIVUK	Luke	23	4	Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd , ‘ I find no basis for a charge against this man. ’
NIVUK	Luke	23	5	But they insisted , ‘ He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching . He started in Galilee and has come all the way here. ’
NIVUK	Luke	23	6	On hearing this , Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean .
NIVUK	Luke	23	7	When he learned that Jesus was under Herod ’ s jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who was also in Jerusalem at that time .
NIVUK	Luke	23	8	When Herod saw Jesus , he was greatly pleased , because for a long time he had been wanting to see him . From what he had heard about him , he hoped to see him perform a sign of some sort .
NIVUK	Luke	23	9	He plied him with many questions , but Jesus gave him no answer .
NIVUK	Luke	23	10	The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there , vehemently accusing him .
NIVUK	Luke	23	11	Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him . Dressing him in an elegant robe , they sent him back to Pilate .
NIVUK	Luke	23	12	That day Herod and Pilate became friends – before this they had been enemies .
NIVUK	Luke	23	13	Pilate called together the chief priests , the rulers and the people ,
NIVUK	Luke	23	14	and said to them , ‘ You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion . I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him .
NIVUK	Luke	23	15	Neither has Herod , for he sent him back to us ; as you can see , he has done nothing to deserve death .
NIVUK	Luke	23	16	Therefore , I will punish him and then release him. ’
NIVUK	Luke	23	18	But the whole crowd shouted , ‘ Away with this man ! Release Barabbas to us ! ’
NIVUK	Luke	23	19	( Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city , and for murder . )
NIVUK	Luke	23	20	Wanting to release Jesus , Pilate appealed to them again .
NIVUK	Luke	23	21	But they kept shouting , ‘ Crucify him ! Crucify him ! ’
NIVUK	Luke	23	22	For the third time he spoke to them : ‘ Why ? What crime has this man committed ? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty . Therefore I will have him punished and then release him. ’
NIVUK	Luke	23	24	So Pilate decided to grant their demand .
NIVUK	Luke	23	25	He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder , the one they asked for , and surrendered Jesus to their will . The crucifixion of Jesus
NIVUK	Luke	23	26	As the soldiers led him away , they seized Simon from Cyrene , who was on his way in from the country , and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus .
NIVUK	Luke	23	27	A large number of people followed him , including women who mourned and wailed for him .
NIVUK	Luke	23	28	Jesus turned and said to them , ‘ Daughters of Jerusalem , do not weep for me ; weep for yourselves and for your children .
NIVUK	Luke	23	29	For the time will come when you will say , “ Blessed are the childless women , the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed ! ”
NIVUK	Luke	23	30	Then ‘ “ they will say to the mountains , ‘ Fall on us ! ’ and to the hills , ‘ Cover us ! ’ ” [ b ]
NIVUK	Luke	23	31	For if people do these things when the tree is green , what will happen when it is dry ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	23	32	Two other men , both criminals , were also led out with him to be executed .
NIVUK	Luke	23	33	When they came to the place called the Skull , they crucified him there , along with the criminals – one on his right , the other on his left .
NIVUK	Luke	23	34	Jesus said , ‘ Father , forgive them , for they do not know what they are doing. ’ [ c ] And they divided up his clothes by casting lots .
NIVUK	Luke	23	35	The people stood watching , and the rulers even sneered at him . They said , ‘ He saved others ; let him save himself if he is God ’ s Messiah , the Chosen One. ’
NIVUK	Luke	23	36	The soldiers also came up and mocked him . They offered him wine vinegar
NIVUK	Luke	23	37	and said , ‘ If you are the king of the Jews , save yourself. ’
NIVUK	Luke	23	38	There was a written notice above him , which read : this is the king of the jews .
NIVUK	Luke	23	39	One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him : ‘ Aren ’ t you the Messiah ? Save yourself and us ! ’
NIVUK	Luke	23	40	But the other criminal rebuked him . ‘ Don ’ t you fear God , ’ he said , ‘ since you are under the same sentence ?
NIVUK	Luke	23	41	We are punished justly , for we are getting what our deeds deserve . But this man has done nothing wrong. ’
NIVUK	Luke	23	42	Then he said , ‘ Jesus , remember me when you come into your kingdom . [ d ] ’
NIVUK	Luke	23	43	Jesus answered him , ‘ Truly I tell you , today you will be with me in paradise. ’ The death of Jesus
NIVUK	Luke	23	44	It was now about noon , and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon ,
NIVUK	Luke	23	45	for the sun stopped shining . And the curtain of the temple was torn in two .
NIVUK	Luke	23	46	Jesus called out with a loud voice , ‘ Father , into your hands I commit my spirit. ’ [ e ] When he had said this , he breathed his last .
NIVUK	Luke	23	47	The centurion , seeing what had happened , praised God and said , ‘ Surely this was a righteous man. ’
NIVUK	Luke	23	48	When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place , they beat their breasts and went away .
NIVUK	Luke	23	49	But all those who knew him , including the women who had followed him from Galilee , stood at a distance , watching these things . The burial of Jesus
NIVUK	Luke	23	50	Now there was a man named Joseph , a member of the Council , a good and upright man ,
NIVUK	Luke	23	51	who had not consented to their decision and action . He came from the Judean town of Arimathea , and he himself was waiting for the kingdom of God .
NIVUK	Luke	23	52	Going to Pilate , he asked for Jesus ’ body .
NIVUK	Luke	23	53	Then he took it down , wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock , one in which no one had yet been laid .
NIVUK	Luke	23	54	It was Preparation Day , and the Sabbath was about to begin .
NIVUK	Luke	23	55	The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it .
NIVUK	Luke	23	56	Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes . But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment .

NIVUK	Luke	24	24	Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said , but they did not see Jesus. ’
NIVUK	Luke	24	2	They found the stone rolled away from the tomb ,
NIVUK	Luke	24	3	but when they entered , they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
NIVUK	Luke	24	4	While they were wondering about this , suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them .
NIVUK	Luke	24	5	In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground , but the men said to them , ‘ Why do you look for the living among the dead ?
NIVUK	Luke	24	6	He is not here ; he has risen ! Remember how he told you , while he was still with you in Galilee :
NIVUK	Luke	24	7	“ The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners , be crucified and on the third day be raised again. ” ’
NIVUK	Luke	24	8	Then they remembered his words .
NIVUK	Luke	24	9	When they came back from the tomb , they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others .
NIVUK	Luke	24	10	It was Mary Magdalene , Joanna , Mary the mother of James , and the others with them who told this to the apostles .

NIVUK	Luke	24	12	Peter , however , got up and ran to the tomb . Bending over , he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves , and he went away , wondering to himself what had happened . On the road to Emmaus
NIVUK	Luke	24	13	Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus , about seven miles [ a ] from Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Luke	24	14	They were talking with each other about everything that had happened .
NIVUK	Luke	24	15	As they talked and discussed these things with each other , Jesus himself came up and walked along with them ;
NIVUK	Luke	24	16	but they were kept from recognising him .
NIVUK	Luke	24	17	He asked them , ‘ What are you discussing together as you walk along ? ’ They stood still , their faces downcast .
NIVUK	Luke	24	18	One of them , named Cleopas , asked him , ‘ Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	24	19	‘ What things ? ’ he asked . ‘ About Jesus of Nazareth , ’ they replied . ‘ He was a prophet , powerful in word and deed before God and all the people .
NIVUK	Luke	24	20	The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death , and they crucified him ;
NIVUK	Luke	24	21	but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel . And what is more , it is the third day since all this took place .
NIVUK	Luke	24	22	In addition , some of our women amazed us . They went to the tomb early this morning
NIVUK	Luke	24	23	but didn ’ t find his body . They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels , who said he was alive .
NIVUK	Luke	24	25	He said to them , ‘ How foolish you are , and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken !
NIVUK	Luke	24	26	Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	24	27	And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets , he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself .
NIVUK	Luke	24	28	As they approached the village to which they were going , Jesus continued on as if he were going further .
NIVUK	Luke	24	29	But they urged him strongly , ‘ Stay with us , for it is nearly evening ; the day is almost over. ’ So he went in to stay with them .
NIVUK	Luke	24	30	When he was at the table with them , he took bread , gave thanks , broke it and began to give it to them .
NIVUK	Luke	24	31	Then their eyes were opened and they recognised him , and he disappeared from their sight .
NIVUK	Luke	24	32	They asked each other , ‘ Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	24	33	They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem . There they found the Eleven and those with them , assembled together
NIVUK	Luke	24	34	and saying , ‘ It is true ! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon. ’
NIVUK	Luke	24	35	Then the two told what had happened on the way , and how Jesus was recognised by them when he broke the bread . Jesus appears to the disciples
NIVUK	Luke	24	36	While they were still talking about this , Jesus himself stood among them and said to them , ‘ Peace be with you. ’
NIVUK	Luke	24	37	They were startled and frightened , thinking they saw a ghost .
NIVUK	Luke	24	38	He said to them , ‘ Why are you troubled , and why do doubts rise in your minds ?
NIVUK	Luke	24	39	Look at my hands and my feet . It is I myself ! Touch me and see ; a ghost does not have flesh and bones , as you see I have. ’
NIVUK	Luke	24	40	When he had said this , he showed them his hands and feet .
NIVUK	Luke	24	41	And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement , he asked them , ‘ Do you have anything here to eat ? ’
NIVUK	Luke	24	42	They gave him a piece of broiled fish ,
NIVUK	Luke	24	43	and he took it and ate it in their presence .
NIVUK	Luke	24	44	He said to them , ‘ This is what I told you while I was still with you : everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses , the Prophets and the Psalms. ’
NIVUK	Luke	24	45	Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures .
NIVUK	Luke	24	46	He told them , ‘ This is what is written : the Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day ,
NIVUK	Luke	24	47	and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations , beginning at Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Luke	24	48	You are witnesses of these things .
NIVUK	Luke	24	49	I am going to send you what my Father has promised ; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high. ’ The ascension of Jesus
NIVUK	Luke	24	50	When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany , he lifted up his hands and blessed them .
NIVUK	Luke	24	51	While he was blessing them , he left them and was taken up into heaven .
NIVUK	Luke	24	52	Then they worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy .

NIVUK	John	1	4	In him was life , and that life was the light of all mankind .
NIVUK	John	1	5	The light shines in the darkness , and the darkness has not overcome [ a ] it .
NIVUK	John	1	6	There was a man sent from God whose name was John .

NIVUK	John	1	19	Now this was John ’ s testimony when the Jewish leaders [ c ] in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was .
NIVUK	John	1	20	He did not fail to confess , but confessed freely , ‘ I am not the Messiah. ’
NIVUK	John	1	21	They asked him , ‘ Then who are you ? Are you Elijah ? ’ He said , ‘ I am not. ’ ‘ Are you the Prophet ? ’ He answered , ‘ No. ’
NIVUK	John	1	22	Finally they said , ‘ Who are you ? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? ’
NIVUK	John	1	23	John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet , ‘ I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness , “ Make straight the way for the Lord. ” ’ [ d ]
NIVUK	John	1	24	Now the Pharisees who had been sent
NIVUK	John	1	25	questioned him , ‘ Why then do you baptise if you are not the Messiah , nor Elijah , nor the Prophet ? ’
NIVUK	John	1	26	‘ I baptise with [ e ] water , ’ John replied , ‘ but among you stands one you do not know .
NIVUK	John	1	27	He is the one who comes after me , the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. ’
NIVUK	John	1	28	,
NIVUK	John	1	29	The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him and said , ‘ Look , the Lamb of God , who takes away the sin of the world !
NIVUK	John	1	30	This is the one I meant when I said , “ A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me. ”

NIVUK	John	1	40	Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother , was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus .
NIVUK	John	1	41	The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him , ‘ We have found the Messiah ’ ( that is , the Christ ) .
NIVUK	John	1	42	And he brought him to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , ‘ You are Simon son of John . You will be called Cephas ’ ( which , when translated , is Peter [ g ] ) . Jesus calls Philip and Nathanael
NIVUK	John	1	43	The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee . Finding Philip , he said to him , ‘ Follow me. ’
NIVUK	John	1	44	Philip , like Andrew and Peter , was from the town of Bethsaida .
NIVUK	John	1	45	Philip found Nathanael and told him , ‘ We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law , and about whom the prophets also wrote – Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph. ’
NIVUK	John	1	46	‘ Nazareth ! Can anything good come from there ? ’ Nathanael asked . ‘ Come and see , ’ said Philip .
NIVUK	John	1	47	When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching , he said of him , ‘ Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit. ’
NIVUK	John	1	48	‘ How do you know me ? ’ Nathanael asked . Jesus answered , ‘ I saw you while you were still under the fig-tree before Philip called you. ’
NIVUK	John	1	49	Then Nathanael declared , ‘ Rabbi , you are the Son of God ; you are the king of Israel. ’
NIVUK	John	1	50	Jesus said , ‘ You believe [ h ] because I told you I saw you under the fig-tree . You will see greater things than that. ’

NIVUK	John	2	3	When the wine was gone , Jesus ’ mother said to him , ‘ They have no more wine. ’
NIVUK	John	2	4	‘ Woman , [ a ] why do you involve me ? ’ Jesus replied . ‘ My hour has not yet come. ’
NIVUK	John	2	5	His mother said to the servants , ‘ Do whatever he tells you. ’
NIVUK	John	2	6	Nearby stood six stone water jars , the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing , each holding from eighty to a hundred and twenty litres .
NIVUK	John	2	7	Jesus said to the servants , ‘ Fill the jars with water ’ ; so they filled them to the brim .
NIVUK	John	2	8	Then he told them , ‘ Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet. ’ They did so ,
NIVUK	John	2	9	and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine . He did not realise where it had come from , though the servants who had drawn the water knew . Then he called the bridegroom aside
NIVUK	John	2	10	and said , ‘ Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink ; but you have saved the best till now. ’
NIVUK	John	2	11	What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs through which he revealed his glory ; and his disciples believed in him .
NIVUK	John	2	12	After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples . There they stayed for a few days . Jesus clears the temple courts
NIVUK	John	2	13	When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover , Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
NIVUK	John	2	14	In the temple courts he found people selling cattle , sheep and doves , and others sitting at tables exchanging money .
NIVUK	John	2	15	So he made a whip out of cords , and drove all from the temple courts , both sheep and cattle ; he scattered the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables .
NIVUK	John	2	16	To those who sold doves he said , ‘ Get these out of here ! Stop turning my Father ’ s house into a market ! ’
NIVUK	John	2	17	His disciples remembered that it is written : ‘ Zeal for your house will consume me. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	John	2	18	The Jews then responded to him , ‘ What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this ? ’
NIVUK	John	2	19	Jesus answered them , ‘ Destroy this temple , and I will raise it again in three days. ’
NIVUK	John	2	20	They replied , ‘ It has taken forty-six years to build this temple , and you are going to raise it in three days ? ’
NIVUK	John	2	21	But the temple he had spoken of was his body .
NIVUK	John	2	22	After he was raised from the dead , his disciples recalled what he had said . Then they believed the Scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken .
NIVUK	John	2	23	Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival , many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name . [ c ]

NIVUK	John	3	12	I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe ; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things ?
NIVUK	John	3	13	No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven – the Son of Man . [ e ]
NIVUK	John	3	14	Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness , so the Son of Man must be lifted up , [ f ]
NIVUK	John	3	15	that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him. ’ [ g ]
NIVUK	John	3	16	For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son , that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life .
NIVUK	John	3	17	For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world , but to save the world through him .
NIVUK	John	3	18	Whoever believes in him is not condemned , but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God ’ s one and only Son .
NIVUK	John	3	19	This is the verdict : light has come into the world , but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil .
NIVUK	John	3	20	Everyone who does evil hates the light , and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed .
NIVUK	John	3	21	. - John 3:30 Some interpreters end the quotation with verse
NIVUK	John	3	22	After this , Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside , where he spent some time with them , and baptised .
NIVUK	John	3	23	Now John also was baptising at Aenon near Salim , because there was plenty of water , and people were coming and being baptised .
NIVUK	John	3	24	( This was before John was put in prison . )
NIVUK	John	3	25	An argument developed between some of John ’ s disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing .
NIVUK	John	3	26	They came to John and said to him , ‘ Rabbi , that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan – the one you testified about – look , he is baptising , and everyone is going to him. ’
NIVUK	John	3	27	To this John replied , ‘ A person can receive only what is given them from heaven .
NIVUK	John	3	28	You yourselves can testify that I said , “ I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him. ”
NIVUK	John	3	29	The bride belongs to the bridegroom . The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him , and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom ’ s voice . That joy is mine , and it is now complete .
NIVUK	John	3	30	He must become greater ; I must become less. ’ [ h ]
NIVUK	John	3	31	The one who comes from above is above all ; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth , and speaks as one from the earth . The one who comes from heaven is above all .
NIVUK	John	3	32	He testifies to what he has seen and heard , but no one accepts his testimony .
NIVUK	John	3	33	Whoever has accepted it has certified that God is truthful .
NIVUK	John	3	34	For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God , for God [ i ] gives the Spirit without limit .
NIVUK	John	3	35	The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands .

NIVUK	John	4	4	Now he had to go through Samaria .
NIVUK	John	4	2	although in fact it was not Jesus who baptised , but his disciples .
NIVUK	John	4	3	So he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee .
NIVUK	John	4	5	So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar , near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph .
NIVUK	John	4	6	Jacob ’ s well was there , and Jesus , tired as he was from the journey , sat down by the well . It was about noon .
NIVUK	John	4	7	When a Samaritan woman came to draw water , Jesus said to her , ‘ Will you give me a drink ? ’
NIVUK	John	4	8	( His disciples had gone into the town to buy food . )
NIVUK	John	4	9	The Samaritan woman said to him , ‘ You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman . How can you ask me for a drink ? ’ ( For Jews do not associate with Samaritans . [ a ] )
NIVUK	John	4	10	Jesus answered her , ‘ If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink , you would have asked him and he would have given you living water. ’
NIVUK	John	4	11	‘ Sir , ’ the woman said , ‘ you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep . Where can you get this living water ?
NIVUK	John	4	12	Are you greater than our father Jacob , who gave us the well and drank from it himself , as did also his sons and his livestock ? ’
NIVUK	John	4	13	Jesus answered , ‘ Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again ,
NIVUK	John	4	14	but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst . Indeed , the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life. ’
NIVUK	John	4	15	The woman said to him , ‘ Sir , give me this water so that I won ’ t get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water. ’
NIVUK	John	4	16	He told her , ‘ Go , call your husband and come back. ’
NIVUK	John	4	17	‘ I have no husband , ’ she replied . Jesus said to her , ‘ You are right when you say you have no husband .
NIVUK	John	4	18	The fact is , you have had five husbands , and the man you now have is not your husband . What you have just said is quite true. ’
NIVUK	John	4	19	‘ Sir , ’ the woman said , ‘ I can see that you are a prophet .
NIVUK	John	4	20	Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain , but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem. ’
NIVUK	John	4	21	‘ Woman , ’ Jesus replied , ‘ believe me , a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem .
NIVUK	John	4	22	You Samaritans worship what you do not know ; we worship what we do know , for salvation is from the Jews .
NIVUK	John	4	23	Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshippers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth , for they are the kind of worshippers the Father seeks .
NIVUK	John	4	24	God is spirit , and his worshippers must worship in the Spirit and in truth. ’
NIVUK	John	4	25	The woman said , ‘ I know that Messiah ’ ( called Christ ) ‘ is coming . When he comes , he will explain everything to us. ’
NIVUK	John	4	26	Then Jesus declared , ‘ I , the one speaking to you – I am he. ’ The disciples rejoin Jesus
NIVUK	John	4	27	Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman . But no one asked , ‘ What do you want ? ’ or ‘ Why are you talking with her ? ’
NIVUK	John	4	28	Then , leaving her water jar , the woman went back to the town and said to the people ,
NIVUK	John	4	29	‘ Come , see a man who told me everything I ’ ve ever done . Could this be the Messiah ? ’
NIVUK	John	4	30	They came out of the town and made their way towards him .
NIVUK	John	4	31	Meanwhile his disciples urged him , ‘ Rabbi , eat something. ’
NIVUK	John	4	32	But he said to them , ‘ I have food to eat that you know nothing about. ’
NIVUK	John	4	33	Then his disciples said to each other , ‘ Could someone have brought him food ? ’
NIVUK	John	4	34	‘ My food , ’ said Jesus , ‘ is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work .
NIVUK	John	4	35	Don ’ t you have a saying , “ It ’ s still four months until harvest ” ? I tell you , open your eyes and look at the fields ! They are ripe for harvest .
NIVUK	John	4	36	Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvests a crop for eternal life , so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together .
NIVUK	John	4	37	Thus the saying “ One sows and another reaps ” is true .
NIVUK	John	4	38	I sent you to reap what you have not worked for . Others have done the hard work , and you have reaped the benefits of their labour. ’ Many Samaritans believe
NIVUK	John	4	39	Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman ’ s testimony , ‘ He told me everything I ’ ve ever done. ’
NIVUK	John	4	40	So when the Samaritans came to him , they urged him to stay with them , and he stayed two days .
NIVUK	John	4	41	And because of his words many more became believers .
NIVUK	John	4	42	They said to the woman , ‘ We no longer believe just because of what you said ; now we have heard for ourselves , and we know that this man really is the Saviour of the world. ’ Jesus heals an official ’ s son
NIVUK	John	4	43	After the two days he left for Galilee .
NIVUK	John	4	44	( Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honour in his own country . )
NIVUK	John	4	45	When he arrived in Galilee , the Galileans welcomed him . They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival , for they also had been there .
NIVUK	John	4	46	Once more he visited Cana in Galilee , where he had turned the water into wine . And there was a certain royal official whose son lay ill at Capernaum .
NIVUK	John	4	47	When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea , he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son , who was close to death .
NIVUK	John	4	48	‘ Unless you people see signs and wonders , ’ Jesus told him , ‘ you will never believe. ’
NIVUK	John	4	49	The royal official said , ‘ Sir , come down before my child dies. ’
NIVUK	John	4	50	‘ Go , ’ Jesus replied , ‘ your son will live. ’ The man took Jesus at his word and departed .
NIVUK	John	4	51	While he was still on the way , his servants met him with the news that his boy was living .
NIVUK	John	4	52	When he enquired as to the time when his son got better , they said to him , ‘ Yesterday , at one in the afternoon , the fever left him. ’
NIVUK	John	4	53	Then the father realised that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him , ‘ Your son will live. ’ So he and his whole household believed .

NIVUK	John	5	5	Some time later , Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals .
NIVUK	John	5	2	Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool , which in Aramaic is called Bethesda [ a ] and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades .
NIVUK	John	5	3	Here a great number of disabled people used to lie – the blind , the lame , the paralysed .
NIVUK	John	5	7	‘ Sir , ’ the invalid replied , ‘ I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred . While I am trying to get in , someone else goes down ahead of me. ’
NIVUK	John	5	8	Then Jesus said to him , ‘ Get up ! Pick up your mat and walk. ’
NIVUK	John	5	9	At once the man was cured ; he picked up his mat and walked . The day on which this took place was a Sabbath ,
NIVUK	John	5	10	and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed , ‘ It is the Sabbath ; the law forbids you to carry your mat. ’
NIVUK	John	5	11	But he replied , ‘ The man who made me well said to me , “ Pick up your mat and walk. ” ’
NIVUK	John	5	12	So they asked him , ‘ Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk ? ’
NIVUK	John	5	13	The man who was healed had no idea who it was , for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there .
NIVUK	John	5	14	Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him , ‘ See , you are well again . Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you. ’
NIVUK	John	5	15	The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well . The authority of the Son
NIVUK	John	5	16	So , because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath , the Jewish leaders began to persecute him .
NIVUK	John	5	17	In his defence Jesus said to them , ‘ My Father is always at his work to this very day , and I too am working. ’
NIVUK	John	5	18	For this reason they tried all the more to kill him ; not only was he breaking the Sabbath , but he was even calling God his own Father , making himself equal with God .
NIVUK	John	5	19	Jesus gave them this answer : ‘ Very truly I tell you , the Son can do nothing by himself ; he can do only what he sees his Father doing , because whatever the Father does the Son also does .
NIVUK	John	5	20	For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does . Yes , and he will show him even greater works than these , so that you will be amazed .
NIVUK	John	5	21	For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life , even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it .
NIVUK	John	5	22	Moreover , the Father judges no one , but has entrusted all judgment to the Son ,
NIVUK	John	5	23	that all may honour the Son just as they honour the Father . Whoever does not honour the Son does not honour the Father , who sent him .
NIVUK	John	5	24	‘ Very truly I tell you , whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life .
NIVUK	John	5	25	Very truly I tell you , a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live .
NIVUK	John	5	26	For as the Father has life in himself , so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself .
NIVUK	John	5	27	And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man .
NIVUK	John	5	28	‘ Do not be amazed at this , for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice
NIVUK	John	5	29	and come out – those who have done what is good will rise to live , and those who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned .
NIVUK	John	5	30	By myself I can do nothing ; I judge only as I hear , and my judgment is just , for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me . Testimonies about Jesus
NIVUK	John	5	31	‘ If I testify about myself , my testimony is not true .
NIVUK	John	5	32	There is another who testifies in my favour , and I know that his testimony about me is true .
NIVUK	John	5	33	‘ You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth .
NIVUK	John	5	34	Not that I accept human testimony ; but I mention it that you may be saved .
NIVUK	John	5	35	John was a lamp that burned and gave light , and you chose for a time to enjoy his light .
NIVUK	John	5	36	‘ I have testimony weightier than that of John . For the works that the Father has given me to finish – the very works that I am doing – testify that the Father has sent me .
NIVUK	John	5	37	And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me . You have never heard his voice nor seen his form ,
NIVUK	John	5	38	nor does his word dwell in you , for you do not believe the one he sent .

NIVUK	John	6	6	He asked this only to test him , for he already had in mind what he was going to do .
NIVUK	John	6	2	and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the signs he had performed by healing those who were ill.
NIVUK	John	6	3	Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples .
NIVUK	John	6	4	The Jewish Passover Festival was near .
NIVUK	John	6	5	When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming towards him , he said to Philip , ‘ Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat ? ’
NIVUK	John	6	7	Philip answered him , ‘ It would take more than half a year ’ s wages [ a ] to buy enough bread for each one to have a bite ! ’
NIVUK	John	6	8	Another of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother , spoke up ,
NIVUK	John	6	9	‘ Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish , but how far will they go among so many ? ’
NIVUK	John	6	10	Jesus said , ‘ Make the people sit down. ’ There was plenty of grass in that place , and they sat down ( about five thousand men were there ) .
NIVUK	John	6	11	Jesus then took the loaves , gave thanks , and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted . He did the same with the fish .
NIVUK	John	6	12	When they had all had enough to eat , he said to his disciples , ‘ Gather the pieces that are left over . Let nothing be wasted. ’
NIVUK	John	6	13	So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten .
NIVUK	John	6	14	After the people saw the sign Jesus performed , they began to say , ‘ Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world. ’
NIVUK	John	6	15	Jesus , knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force , withdrew again to a mountain by himself . Jesus walks on the water
NIVUK	John	6	16	When evening came , his disciples went down to the lake ,
NIVUK	John	6	17	where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum . By now it was dark , and Jesus had not yet joined them .
NIVUK	John	6	18	A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough .
NIVUK	John	6	19	When they had rowed about three or four miles , [ b ] they saw Jesus approaching the boat , walking on the water ; and they were frightened .
NIVUK	John	6	20	But he said to them , ‘ It is I ; don ’ t be afraid. ’
NIVUK	John	6	21	Then they were willing to take him into the boat , and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading .
NIVUK	John	6	22	The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realised that only one boat had been there , and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples , but that they had gone away alone .
NIVUK	John	6	23	Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks .
NIVUK	John	6	24	Once the crowd realised that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there , they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus . Jesus the bread of life
NIVUK	John	6	25	When they found him on the other side of the lake , they asked him , ‘ Rabbi , when did you get here ? ’
NIVUK	John	6	26	Jesus answered , ‘ Very truly I tell you , you are looking for me , not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill .
NIVUK	John	6	27	Do not work for food that spoils , but for food that endures to eternal life , which the Son of Man will give you . For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval. ’
NIVUK	John	6	28	Then they asked him , ‘ What must we do to do the works God requires ? ’
NIVUK	John	6	29	Jesus answered , ‘ The work of God is this : to believe in the one he has sent. ’
NIVUK	John	6	30	So they asked him , ‘ What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you ? What will you do ?
NIVUK	John	6	31	Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness ; as it is written : “ He gave them bread from heaven to eat. ” [ c ] ’
NIVUK	John	6	32	Jesus said to them , ‘ Very truly I tell you , it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven , but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven .
NIVUK	John	6	33	For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. ’
NIVUK	John	6	34	‘ Sir , ’ they said , ‘ always give us this bread. ’
NIVUK	John	6	35	Then Jesus declared , ‘ I am the bread of life . Whoever comes to me will never go hungry , and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty .
NIVUK	John	6	36	But as I told you , you have seen me and still you do not believe .
NIVUK	John	6	37	All those the Father gives me will come to me , and whoever comes to me I will never drive away .
NIVUK	John	6	38	For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me .
NIVUK	John	6	39	And this is the will of him who sent me , that I shall lose none of all those he has given me , but raise them up at the last day .
NIVUK	John	6	40	For my Father ’ s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life , and I will raise them up at the last day. ’
NIVUK	John	6	41	At this the Jews there began to grumble about him because he said , ‘ I am the bread that came down from heaven. ’
NIVUK	John	6	42	They said , ‘ Is this not Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? How can he now say , “ I came down from heaven ” ? ’
NIVUK	John	6	43	‘ Stop grumbling among yourselves , ’ Jesus answered .
NIVUK	John	6	44	‘ No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them , and I will raise them up at the last day .
NIVUK	John	6	45	It is written in the Prophets : “ They will all be taught by God. ” [ d ] Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me .
NIVUK	John	6	46	No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God ; only he has seen the Father .
NIVUK	John	6	47	Very truly I tell you , the one who believes has eternal life .
NIVUK	John	6	48	I am the bread of life .
NIVUK	John	6	49	Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness , yet they died .
NIVUK	John	6	50	But here is the bread that comes down from heaven , which anyone may eat and not die .
NIVUK	John	6	51	I am the living bread that came down from heaven . Whoever eats this bread will live for ever . This bread is my flesh , which I will give for the life of the world. ’
NIVUK	John	6	52	Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves , ‘ How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? ’
NIVUK	John	6	53	Jesus said to them , ‘ Very truly I tell you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you have no life in you .
NIVUK	John	6	54	Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life , and I will raise them up at the last day .
NIVUK	John	6	55	For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink .
NIVUK	John	6	56	Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me , and I in them .
NIVUK	John	6	57	Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father , so the one who feeds on me will live because of me .
NIVUK	John	6	58	This is the bread that came down from heaven . Your ancestors ate manna and died , but whoever feeds on this bread will live for ever. ’
NIVUK	John	6	59	He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum . Many disciples desert Jesus
NIVUK	John	6	60	On hearing it , many of his disciples said , ‘ This is a hard teaching . Who can accept it ? ’
NIVUK	John	6	61	Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this , Jesus said to them , ‘ Does this offend you ?
NIVUK	John	6	62	Then what if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before !
NIVUK	John	6	63	The Spirit gives life ; the flesh counts for nothing . The words I have spoken to you – they are full of the Spirit [ e ] and life .
NIVUK	John	6	64	Yet there are some of you who do not believe. ’ For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him .
NIVUK	John	6	65	He went on to say , ‘ This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled them. ’
NIVUK	John	6	66	From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him .
NIVUK	John	6	67	‘ You do not want to leave too , do you ? ’ Jesus asked the Twelve .
NIVUK	John	6	68	Simon Peter answered him , ‘ Lord , to whom shall we go ? You have the words of eternal life .
NIVUK	John	6	69	We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God. ’
NIVUK	John	6	70	Then Jesus replied , ‘ Have I not chosen you , the Twelve ? Yet one of you is a devil ! ’

NIVUK	John	7	7	The world can not hate you , but it hates me because I testify that its works are evil .
NIVUK	John	7	2	But when the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near ,
NIVUK	John	7	3	Jesus ’ brothers said to him , ‘ Leave Galilee and go to Judea , so that your disciples there may see the works you do .
NIVUK	John	7	4	No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret . Since you are doing these things , show yourself to the world. ’
NIVUK	John	7	5	For even his own brothers did not believe in him .
NIVUK	John	7	6	Therefore Jesus told them , ‘ My time is not yet here ; for you any time will do .
NIVUK	John	7	8	You go to the festival . I am not [ b ] going up to this festival , because my time has not yet fully come. ’
NIVUK	John	7	9	After he had said this , he stayed in Galilee .
NIVUK	John	7	10	However , after his brothers had left for the festival , he went also , not publicly , but in secret .
NIVUK	John	7	11	Now at the festival the Jewish leaders were watching for Jesus and asking , ‘ Where is he ? ’
NIVUK	John	7	12	Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him . Some said , ‘ He is a good man. ’ Others replied , ‘ No , he deceives the people. ’
NIVUK	John	7	13	But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the leaders . Jesus teaches at the festival
NIVUK	John	7	14	Not until halfway through the festival did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach .
NIVUK	John	7	15	The Jews there were amazed and asked , ‘ How did this man get such learning without having been taught ? ’
NIVUK	John	7	16	Jesus answered , ‘ My teaching is not my own . It comes from the one who sent me .
NIVUK	John	7	17	Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own .
NIVUK	John	7	18	Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory , but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth ; there is nothing false about him .
NIVUK	John	7	19	Has not Moses given you the law ? Yet not one of you keeps the law . Why are you trying to kill me ? ’
NIVUK	John	7	20	‘ You are demon-possessed , ’ the crowd answered . ‘ Who is trying to kill you ? ’
NIVUK	John	7	21	Jesus said to them , ‘ I did one miracle , and you are all amazed .
NIVUK	John	7	22	Yet , because Moses gave you circumcision ( though actually it did not come from Moses , but from the patriarchs ) , you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath .
NIVUK	John	7	23	Now if a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken , why are you angry with me for healing a man ’ s whole body on the Sabbath ?
NIVUK	John	7	24	Stop judging by mere appearances , but instead judge correctly. ’ Division over who Jesus is
NIVUK	John	7	25	At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask , ‘ Isn ’ t this the man they are trying to kill ?
NIVUK	John	7	26	Here he is , speaking publicly , and they are not saying a word to him . Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Messiah ?
NIVUK	John	7	27	But we know where this man is from ; when the Messiah comes , no one will know where he is from. ’
NIVUK	John	7	28	Then Jesus , still teaching in the temple courts , cried out , ‘ Yes , you know me , and you know where I am from . I am not here on my own authority , but he who sent me is true . You do not know him ,
NIVUK	John	7	29	but I know him because I am from him and he sent me. ’
NIVUK	John	7	30	At this they tried to seize him , but no one laid a hand on him , because his hour had not yet come .
NIVUK	John	7	31	Still , many in the crowd believed in him . They said , ‘ When the Messiah comes , will he perform more signs than this man ? ’
NIVUK	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him . Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him .
NIVUK	John	7	33	Jesus said , ‘ I am with you for only a short time , and then I am going to the one who sent me .
NIVUK	John	7	34	You will look for me , but you will not find me ; and where I am , you can not come. ’
NIVUK	John	7	35	The Jews said to one another , ‘ Where does this man intend to go that we can not find him ? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks , and teach the Greeks ?
NIVUK	John	7	36	What did he mean when he said , “ You will look for me , but you will not find me , ” and “ Where I am , you can not come ” ? ’
NIVUK	John	7	37	On the last and greatest day of the festival , Jesus stood and said in a loud voice , ‘ Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink .
NIVUK	John	7	38	Whoever believes in me , as Scripture has said , rivers of living water will flow from within them. ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	John	7	39	By this he meant the Spirit , whom those who believed in him were later to receive . Up to that time the Spirit had not been given , since Jesus had not yet been glorified .
NIVUK	John	7	40	On hearing his words , some of the people said , ‘ Surely this man is the Prophet. ’
NIVUK	John	7	41	Others said , ‘ He is the Messiah. ’ Still others asked , ‘ How can the Messiah come from Galilee ?
NIVUK	John	7	42	Does not Scripture say that the Messiah will come from David ’ s descendants and from Bethlehem , the town where David lived ? ’
NIVUK	John	7	43	Thus the people were divided because of Jesus .
NIVUK	John	7	44	Some wanted to seize him , but no one laid a hand on him . Unbelief of the Jewish leaders
NIVUK	John	7	45	Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and the Pharisees , who asked them , ‘ Why didn ’ t you bring him in ? ’
NIVUK	John	7	46	‘ No one ever spoke the way this man does , ’ the guards replied .
NIVUK	John	7	47	‘ You mean he has deceived you also ? ’ the Pharisees retorted .
NIVUK	John	7	48	‘ Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him ?
NIVUK	John	7	49	No ! But this mob that knows nothing of the law – there is a curse on them. ’
NIVUK	John	7	50	Nicodemus , who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number , asked ,
NIVUK	John	7	51	‘ Does our law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he has been doing ? ’
NIVUK	John	7	52	They replied , ‘ Are you from Galilee , too ? Look into it , and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee. ’ [ The earliest manuscripts and many other ancient witnesses do not have John 7:53 – 8:11 . A few manuscripts include these verses , wholly or in part , after John 7:36 , John 21:25 , Luke 21:38 or Luke 24:53 . ]

NIVUK	John	8	8	Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground .
NIVUK	John	8	1	but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives .
NIVUK	John	8	2	At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts , where all the people gathered round him , and he sat down to teach them .
NIVUK	John	8	3	The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery . They made her stand before the group
NIVUK	John	8	4	and said to Jesus , ‘ Teacher , this woman was caught in the act of adultery .
NIVUK	John	8	5	In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women . Now what do you say ? ’
NIVUK	John	8	6	They were using this question as a trap , in order to have a basis for accusing him . But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger .
NIVUK	John	8	7	When they kept on questioning him , he straightened up and said to them , ‘ Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her. ’
NIVUK	John	8	9	At this , those who heard began to go away one at a time , the older ones first , until only Jesus was left , with the woman still standing there .
NIVUK	John	8	10	Jesus straightened up and asked her , ‘ Woman , where are they ? Has no one condemned you ? ’
NIVUK	John	8	11	‘ No one , sir , ’ she said . ‘ Then neither do I condemn you , ’ Jesus declared . ‘ Go now and leave your life of sin. ’ Dispute over Jesus ’ testimony
NIVUK	John	8	12	When Jesus spoke again to the people , he said , ‘ I am the light of the world . Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness , but will have the light of life. ’
NIVUK	John	8	13	The Pharisees challenged him , ‘ Here you are , appearing as your own witness ; your testimony is not valid. ’
NIVUK	John	8	14	Jesus answered , ‘ Even if I testify on my own behalf , my testimony is valid , for I know where I came from and where I am going . But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going .
NIVUK	John	8	15	You judge by human standards ; I pass judgment on no one .
NIVUK	John	8	16	But if I do judge , my decisions are true , because I am not alone . I stand with the Father , who sent me .
NIVUK	John	8	17	In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true .
NIVUK	John	8	18	I am one who testifies for myself ; my other witness is the Father , who sent me. ’
NIVUK	John	8	19	Then they asked him , ‘ Where is your father ? ’ ‘ You do not know me or my Father , ’ Jesus replied . ‘ If you knew me , you would know my Father also. ’
NIVUK	John	8	20	He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts near the place where the offerings were put . Yet no one seized him , because his hour had not yet come . Dispute over who Jesus is
NIVUK	John	8	21	Once more Jesus said to them , ‘ I am going away , and you will look for me , and you will die in your sin . Where I go , you can not come. ’
NIVUK	John	8	22	This made the Jews ask , ‘ Will he kill himself ? Is that why he says , “ Where I go , you can not come ” ? ’
NIVUK	John	8	23	But he continued , ‘ You are from below ; I am from above . You are of this world ; I am not of this world .
NIVUK	John	8	24	I told you that you would die in your sins ; if you do not believe that I am he , you will indeed die in your sins. ’
NIVUK	John	8	25	‘ Who are you ? ’ they asked . ‘ Just what I have been telling you from the beginning , ’ Jesus replied .
NIVUK	John	8	26	‘ I have much to say in judgment of you . But he who sent me is trustworthy , and what I have heard from him I tell the world. ’
NIVUK	John	8	27	They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father .
NIVUK	John	8	28	So Jesus said , ‘ When you have lifted up [ a ] the Son of Man , then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me .
NIVUK	John	8	29	The one who sent me is with me ; he has not left me alone , for I always do what pleases him. ’
NIVUK	John	8	30	Even as he spoke , many believed in him . Dispute over whose children Jesus ’ opponents are
NIVUK	John	8	31	To the Jews who had believed him , Jesus said , ‘ If you hold to my teaching , you are really my disciples .
NIVUK	John	8	32	Then you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free. ’
NIVUK	John	8	33	They answered him , ‘ We are Abraham ’ s descendants and have never been slaves of anyone . How can you say that we shall be set free ? ’
NIVUK	John	8	34	Jesus replied , ‘ Very truly I tell you , everyone who sins is a slave to sin .
NIVUK	John	8	35	Now a slave has no permanent place in the family , but a son belongs to it for ever .
NIVUK	John	8	36	So if the Son sets you free , you will be free indeed .
NIVUK	John	8	37	I know you are Abraham ’ s descendants . Yet you are looking for a way to kill me , because you have no room for my word .
NIVUK	John	8	38	I am telling you what I have seen in the Father ’ s presence , and you are doing what you have heard from your father . [ b ] ’
NIVUK	John	8	39	‘ Abraham is our father , ’ they answered . ‘ If you were Abraham ’ s children , ’ said Jesus , ‘ then you would [ c ] do what Abraham did .
NIVUK	John	8	40	As it is , you are looking for a way to kill me , a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God . Abraham did not do such things .
NIVUK	John	8	41	You are doing the works of your own father. ’ ‘ We are not illegitimate children , ’ they protested . ‘ The only Father we have is God himself. ’
NIVUK	John	8	42	Jesus said to them , ‘ If God were your Father , you would love me , for I have come here from God . I have not come on my own ; God sent me .
NIVUK	John	8	43	Why is my language not clear to you ? Because you are unable to hear what I say .
NIVUK	John	8	44	You belong to your father , the devil , and you want to carry out your father ’ s desires . He was a murderer from the beginning , not holding to the truth , for there is no truth in him . When he lies , he speaks his native language , for he is a liar and the father of lies .
NIVUK	John	8	45	Yet because I tell the truth , you do not believe me !
NIVUK	John	8	46	Can any of you prove me guilty of sin ? If I am telling the truth , why don ’ t you believe me ?
NIVUK	John	8	47	Whoever belongs to God hears what God says . The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God. ’ Jesus ’ claims about himself
NIVUK	John	8	48	The Jews answered him , ‘ Aren ’ t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed ? ’
NIVUK	John	8	49	‘ I am not possessed by a demon , ’ said Jesus , ‘ but I honour my Father and you dishonour me .
NIVUK	John	8	50	I am not seeking glory for myself ; but there is one who seeks it , and he is the judge .
NIVUK	John	8	51	Very truly I tell you , whoever obeys my word will never see death. ’
NIVUK	John	8	52	At this they exclaimed , ‘ Now we know that you are demon-possessed ! Abraham died and so did the prophets , yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death .
NIVUK	John	8	53	Are you greater than our father Abraham ? He died , and so did the prophets . Who do you think you are ? ’
NIVUK	John	8	54	Jesus replied , ‘ If I glorify myself , my glory means nothing . My Father , whom you claim as your God , is the one who glorifies me .
NIVUK	John	8	55	Though you do not know him , I know him . If I said I did not , I would be a liar like you , but I do know him and obey his word .
NIVUK	John	8	56	Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day ; he saw it and was glad. ’
NIVUK	John	8	57	‘ You are not yet fifty years old , ’ they said to him , ‘ and you have seen Abraham ! ’
NIVUK	John	8	58	‘ Very truly I tell you , ’ Jesus answered , ‘ before Abraham was born , I am ! ’

NIVUK	John	9	9	Some claimed that he was . Others said , ‘ No , he only looks like him. ’ But he himself insisted , ‘ I am the man. ’
NIVUK	John	9	2	His disciples asked him , ‘ Rabbi , who sinned , this man or his parents , that he was born blind ? ’
NIVUK	John	9	3	‘ Neither this man nor his parents sinned , ’ said Jesus , ‘ but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him .
NIVUK	John	9	4	As long as it is day , we must do the works of him who sent me . Night is coming , when no one can work .
NIVUK	John	9	5	While I am in the world , I am the light of the world. ’
NIVUK	John	9	6	After saying this , he spat on the ground , made some mud with the saliva , and put it on the man ’ s eyes .
NIVUK	John	9	7	‘ Go , ’ he told him , ‘ wash in the Pool of Siloam ’ ( this word means ‘ Sent ’ ) . So the man went and washed , and came home seeing .
NIVUK	John	9	8	His neighbours and those who had formerly seen him begging asked , ‘ Isn ’ t this the same man who used to sit and beg ? ’
NIVUK	John	9	10	‘ How then were your eyes opened ? ’ they asked .
NIVUK	John	9	11	He replied , ‘ The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes . He told me to go to Siloam and wash . So I went and washed , and then I could see. ’
NIVUK	John	9	12	‘ Where is this man ? ’ they asked him . ‘ I don ’ t know , ’ he said . The Pharisees investigate the healing
NIVUK	John	9	13	They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind .
NIVUK	John	9	14	Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man ’ s eyes was a Sabbath .
NIVUK	John	9	15	Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight . ‘ He put mud on my eyes , ’ the man replied , ‘ and I washed , and now I see. ’
NIVUK	John	9	16	Some of the Pharisees said , ‘ This man is not from God , for he does not keep the Sabbath. ’ But others asked , ‘ How can a sinner perform such signs ? ’ So they were divided .
NIVUK	John	9	17	Then they turned again to the blind man , ‘ What have you to say about him ? It was your eyes he opened. ’ The man replied , ‘ He is a prophet. ’
NIVUK	John	9	18	They still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man ’ s parents .
NIVUK	John	9	19	‘ Is this your son ? ’ they asked . ‘ Is this the one you say was born blind ? How is it that now he can see ? ’
NIVUK	John	9	20	‘ We know he is our son , ’ the parents answered , ‘ and we know he was born blind .
NIVUK	John	9	21	But how he can see now , or who opened his eyes , we don ’ t know . Ask him . He is of age ; he will speak for himself. ’
NIVUK	John	9	22	His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders , who already had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue .
NIVUK	John	9	23	That was why his parents said , ‘ He is of age ; ask him. ’
NIVUK	John	9	24	A second time they summoned the man who had been blind . ‘ Give glory to God by telling the truth , ’ they said . ‘ We know this man is a sinner. ’
NIVUK	John	9	25	He replied , ‘ Whether he is a sinner or not , I don ’ t know . One thing I do know . I was blind but now I see ! ’
NIVUK	John	9	26	Then they asked him , ‘ What did he do to you ? How did he open your eyes ? ’
NIVUK	John	9	27	He answered , ‘ I have told you already and you did not listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you want to become his disciples too ? ’
NIVUK	John	9	28	Then they hurled insults at him and said , ‘ You are this fellow ’ s disciple ! We are disciples of Moses !
NIVUK	John	9	29	We know that God spoke to Moses , but as for this fellow , we don ’ t even know where he comes from. ’
NIVUK	John	9	30	The man answered , ‘ Now that is remarkable ! You don ’ t know where he comes from , yet he opened my eyes .
NIVUK	John	9	31	We know that God does not listen to sinners . He listens to the godly person who does his will .
NIVUK	John	9	32	Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind .
NIVUK	John	9	33	If this man were not from God , he could do nothing. ’
NIVUK	John	9	34	To this they replied , ‘ You were steeped in sin at birth ; how dare you lecture us ! ’ And they threw him out . Spiritual blindness
NIVUK	John	9	35	Jesus heard that they had thrown him out , and when he found him , he said , ‘ Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ’
NIVUK	John	9	36	‘ Who is he , sir ? ’ the man asked . ‘ Tell me so that I may believe in him. ’
NIVUK	John	9	37	Jesus said , ‘ You have now seen him ; in fact , he is the one speaking with you. ’
NIVUK	John	9	38	Then the man said , ‘ Lord , I believe , ’ and he worshipped him .

NIVUK	John	9	40	Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked , ‘ What ? Are we blind too ? ’

NIVUK	John	10	10	The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy ; I have come that they may have life , and have it to the full .
NIVUK	John	10	2	The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep .
NIVUK	John	10	3	The gatekeeper opens the gate for him , and the sheep listen to his voice . He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
NIVUK	John	10	4	When he has brought out all his own , he goes on ahead of them , and his sheep follow him because they know his voice .
NIVUK	John	10	5	But they will never follow a stranger ; in fact , they will run away from him because they do not recognise a stranger ’ s voice. ’
NIVUK	John	10	6	Jesus used this figure of speech , but the Pharisees did not understand what he was telling them .
NIVUK	John	10	7	Therefore Jesus said again , ‘ Very truly I tell you , I am the gate for the sheep .
NIVUK	John	10	8	All who have come before me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep have not listened to them .
NIVUK	John	10	9	I am the gate ; whoever enters through me will be saved . [ a ] They will come in and go out , and find pasture .
NIVUK	John	10	11	‘ I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep .
NIVUK	John	10	12	The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep . So when he sees the wolf coming , he abandons the sheep and runs away . Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it .
NIVUK	John	10	13	The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep .
NIVUK	John	10	14	‘ I am the good shepherd ; I know my sheep and my sheep know me –
NIVUK	John	10	15	just as the Father knows me and I know the Father – and I lay down my life for the sheep .
NIVUK	John	10	16	I have other sheep that are not of this sheepfold . I must bring them also . They too will listen to my voice , and there shall be one flock and one shepherd .
NIVUK	John	10	17	The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life – only to take it up again .
NIVUK	John	10	18	No one takes it from me , but I lay it down of my own accord . I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again . This command I received from my Father. ’
NIVUK	John	10	19	The Jews who heard these words were again divided .
NIVUK	John	10	20	Many of them said , ‘ He is demon-possessed and raving mad . Why listen to him ? ’
NIVUK	John	10	21	But others said , ‘ These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon . Can a demon open the eyes of the blind ? ’ Further conflict over Jesus ’ claims
NIVUK	John	10	22	Then came the Festival of Dedication [ b ] at Jerusalem . It was winter ,
NIVUK	John	10	23	and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon ’ s Colonnade .
NIVUK	John	10	24	The Jews who were there gathered round him , saying , ‘ How long will you keep us in suspense ? If you are the Messiah , tell us plainly. ’
NIVUK	John	10	25	Jesus answered , ‘ I did tell you , but you do not believe . The works I do in my Father ’ s name testify about me ,
NIVUK	John	10	26	but you do not believe because you are not my sheep .
NIVUK	John	10	27	My sheep listen to my voice ; I know them , and they follow me .
NIVUK	John	10	28	I give them eternal life , and they shall never perish ; no one will snatch them out of my hand .
NIVUK	John	10	29	My Father , who has given them to me , is greater than all [ c ] ; no one can snatch them out of my Father ’ s hand .
NIVUK	John	10	30	I and the Father are one. ’
NIVUK	John	10	31	Again his Jewish opponents picked up stones to stone him ,
NIVUK	John	10	32	but Jesus said to them , ‘ I have shown you many good works from the Father . For which of these do you stone me ? ’
NIVUK	John	10	33	‘ We are not stoning you for any good work , ’ they replied , ‘ but for blasphemy , because you , a mere man , claim to be God. ’
NIVUK	John	10	34	Jesus answered them , ‘ Is it not written in your Law , “ I have said you are ‘ gods ’ ” [ d ] ?
NIVUK	John	10	35	If he called them “ gods ” , to whom the word of God came – and Scripture can not be set aside –
NIVUK	John	10	36	what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world ? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said , “ I am God ’ s Son ” ?
NIVUK	John	10	37	Do not believe me unless I do the works of my Father .
NIVUK	John	10	38	But if I do them , even though you do not believe me , believe the works , that you may know and understand that the Father is in me , and I in the Father. ’
NIVUK	John	10	39	Again they tried to seize him , but he escaped their grasp .
NIVUK	John	10	40	Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptising in the early days . There he stayed ,
NIVUK	John	10	41	and many people came to him . They said , ‘ Though John never performed a sign , all that John said about this man was true. ’

NIVUK	John	11	4	When he heard this , Jesus said , ‘ This illness will not end in death . No , it is for God ’ s glory so that God ’ s Son may be glorified through it. ’
NIVUK	John	11	5	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
NIVUK	John	11	6	So when he heard that Lazarus was ill , he stayed where he was two more days ,
NIVUK	John	11	7	and then he said to his disciples , ‘ Let us go back to Judea. ’
NIVUK	John	11	8	‘ But Rabbi , ’ they said , ‘ a short while ago the Jews there tried to stone you , and yet you are going back ? ’
NIVUK	John	11	9	Jesus answered , ‘ Are there not twelve hours of daylight ? Anyone who walks in the day-time will not stumble , for they see by this world ’ s light .
NIVUK	John	11	10	It is when a person walks at night that they stumble , for they have no light. ’
NIVUK	John	11	12	His disciples replied , ‘ Lord , if he sleeps , he will get better. ’
NIVUK	John	11	13	Jesus had been speaking of his death , but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep .
NIVUK	John	11	14	So then he told them plainly , ‘ Lazarus is dead ,
NIVUK	John	11	15	and for your sake I am glad I was not there , so that you may believe . But let us go to him. ’
NIVUK	John	11	16	Then Thomas ( also known as Didymus [ a ] ) said to the rest of the disciples , ‘ Let us also go , that we may die with him. ’ Jesus comforts the sisters of Lazarus
NIVUK	John	11	17	On his arrival , Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days .
NIVUK	John	11	18	Now Bethany was less than two miles [ b ] from Jerusalem ,
NIVUK	John	11	19	and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother .
NIVUK	John	11	20	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went out to meet him , but Mary stayed at home .
NIVUK	John	11	21	‘ Lord , ’ Martha said to Jesus , ‘ if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
NIVUK	John	11	22	But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask. ’
NIVUK	John	11	23	Jesus said to her , ‘ Your brother will rise again. ’
NIVUK	John	11	24	Martha answered , ‘ I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day. ’
NIVUK	John	11	25	Jesus said to her , ‘ I am the resurrection and the life . The one who believes in me will live , even though they die ;
NIVUK	John	11	26	and whoever lives by believing in me will never die . Do you believe this ? ’
NIVUK	John	11	27	‘ Yes , Lord , ’ she replied , ‘ I believe that you are the Messiah , the Son of God , who is to come into the world. ’
NIVUK	John	11	28	After she had said this , she went back and called her sister Mary aside . ‘ The Teacher is here , ’ she said , ‘ and is asking for you. ’
NIVUK	John	11	29	When Mary heard this , she got up quickly and went to him .
NIVUK	John	11	30	Now Jesus had not yet entered the village , but was still at the place where Martha had met him .
NIVUK	John	11	31	When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house , comforting her , noticed how quickly she got up and went out , they followed her , supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there .
NIVUK	John	11	32	When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him , she fell at his feet and said , ‘ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died. ’
NIVUK	John	11	33	When Jesus saw her weeping , and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping , he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled .
NIVUK	John	11	34	‘ Where have you laid him ? ’ he asked . ‘ Come and see , Lord , ’ they replied .
NIVUK	John	11	35	Jesus wept .
NIVUK	John	11	36	Then the Jews said , ‘ See how he loved him ! ’
NIVUK	John	11	37	But some of them said , ‘ Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying ? ’ Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead
NIVUK	John	11	38	Jesus , once more deeply moved , came to the tomb . It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance .
NIVUK	John	11	39	‘ Take away the stone , ’ he said . ‘ But , Lord , ’ said Martha , the sister of the dead man , ‘ by this time there is a bad odour , for he has been there four days. ’
NIVUK	John	11	40	Then Jesus said , ‘ Did I not tell you that if you believe , you will see the glory of God ? ’
NIVUK	John	11	41	So they took away the stone . Then Jesus looked up and said , ‘ Father , I thank you that you have heard me .
NIVUK	John	11	42	I knew that you always hear me , but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here , that they may believe that you sent me. ’
NIVUK	John	11	43	When he had said this , Jesus called in a loud voice , ‘ Lazarus , come out ! ’
NIVUK	John	11	44	The dead man came out , his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen , and a cloth round his face . Jesus said to them , ‘ Take off the grave clothes and let him go. ’ The plot to kill Jesus
NIVUK	John	11	45	Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary , and had seen what Jesus did , believed in him .
NIVUK	John	11	46	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done .
NIVUK	John	11	47	Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin . ‘ What are we accomplishing ? ’ they asked . ‘ Here is this man performing many signs .
NIVUK	John	11	48	If we let him go on like this , everyone will believe in him , and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation. ’
NIVUK	John	11	49	Then one of them , named Caiaphas , who was high priest that year , spoke up , ‘ You know nothing at all !
NIVUK	John	11	50	You do not realise that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish. ’
NIVUK	John	11	51	He did not say this on his own , but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation ,
NIVUK	John	11	52	and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God , to bring them together and make them one .
NIVUK	John	11	53	So from that day on they plotted to take his life .
NIVUK	John	11	54	Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea . Instead he withdrew to a region near the wilderness , to a village called Ephraim , where he stayed with his disciples .
NIVUK	John	11	55	When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover , many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover .
NIVUK	John	11	56	They kept looking for Jesus , and as they stood in the temple courts they asked one another , ‘ What do you think ? Isn ’ t he coming to the festival at all ? ’
NIVUK	John	11	57	But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where Jesus was should report it so that they might arrest him . Footnotes - John 11:16 Thomas ( Aramaic ) and Didymus ( Greek ) both mean twin . - John 11:18 Or about

NIVUK	John	12	12	The next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem .
NIVUK	John	12	2	Here a dinner was given in Jesus ’ honour . Martha served , while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him .
NIVUK	John	12	3	Then Mary took about half a litre of pure nard , an expensive perfume ; she poured it on Jesus ’ feet and wiped his feet with her hair . And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume .
NIVUK	John	12	4	But one of his disciples , Judas Iscariot , who was later to betray him , objected ,
NIVUK	John	12	5	‘ Why wasn ’ t this perfume sold and the money given to the poor ? It was worth a year ’ s wages . [ a ] ’
NIVUK	John	12	6	He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief ; as keeper of the money bag , he used to help himself to what was put into it .
NIVUK	John	12	7	‘ Leave her alone , ’ Jesus replied . ‘ It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial .
NIVUK	John	12	8	You will always have the poor among you , [ b ] but you will not always have me. ’
NIVUK	John	12	9	Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came , not only because of him but also to see Lazarus , whom he had raised from the dead .
NIVUK	John	12	10	So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well ,
NIVUK	John	12	11	for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and believing in him . Jesus comes to Jerusalem as king
NIVUK	John	12	13	They took palm branches and went out to meet him , shouting , ‘ Hosanna ! [ c ] ’ ‘ Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! ’ [ d ] ‘ Blessed is the king of Israel ! ’
NIVUK	John	12	14	Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it , as it is written :
NIVUK	John	12	15	‘ Do not be afraid , Daughter Zion ; see , your king is coming , seated on a donkey ’ s colt. ’ [ e ]
NIVUK	John	12	16	At first his disciples did not understand all this . Only after Jesus was glorified did they realise that these things had been written about him and that these things had been done to him .
NIVUK	John	12	17	Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word .
NIVUK	John	12	18	Many people , because they had heard that he had performed this sign , went out to meet him .
NIVUK	John	12	19	So the Pharisees said to one another , ‘ See , this is getting us nowhere . Look how the whole world has gone after him ! ’ Jesus predicts his death
NIVUK	John	12	20	Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the festival .
NIVUK	John	12	21	They came to Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee , with a request . ‘ Sir , ’ they said , ‘ we would like to see Jesus. ’
NIVUK	John	12	22	Philip went to tell Andrew ; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus .
NIVUK	John	12	23	Jesus replied , ‘ The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified .
NIVUK	John	12	24	Very truly I tell you , unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies , it remains only a single seed . But if it dies , it produces many seeds .
NIVUK	John	12	25	Anyone who loves their life will lose it , while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life .
NIVUK	John	12	26	Whoever serves me must follow me ; and where I am , my servant also will be . My Father will honour the one who serves me .
NIVUK	John	12	27	‘ Now my soul is troubled , and what shall I say ? “ Father , save me from this hour ” ? No , it was for this very reason I came to this hour .
NIVUK	John	12	28	Father , glorify your name ! ’ Then a voice came from heaven , ‘ I have glorified it , and will glorify it again. ’
NIVUK	John	12	29	The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered ; others said an angel had spoken to him .
NIVUK	John	12	30	Jesus said , ‘ This voice was for your benefit , not mine .
NIVUK	John	12	31	Now is the time for judgment on this world ; now the prince of this world will be driven out .
NIVUK	John	12	32	And I , when I am lifted up [ f ] from the earth , will draw all people to myself. ’
NIVUK	John	12	33	He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die .
NIVUK	John	12	34	The crowd spoke up , ‘ We have heard from the Law that the Messiah will remain for ever , so how can you say , “ The Son of Man must be lifted up ” ? Who is this “ Son of Man ” ? ’
NIVUK	John	12	35	Then Jesus told them , ‘ You are going to have the light just a little while longer . Walk while you have the light , before darkness overtakes you . Whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going .
NIVUK	John	12	36	Believe in the light while you have the light , so that you may become children of light. ’ When he had finished speaking , Jesus left and hid himself from them . Belief and unbelief among the Jews
NIVUK	John	12	37	Even after Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence , they still would not believe in him .
NIVUK	John	12	38	This was to fulfil the word of Isaiah the prophet : ‘ Lord , who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ? ’ [ g ]
NIVUK	John	12	39	For this reason they could not believe , because , as Isaiah says elsewhere :
NIVUK	John	12	40	‘ He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts , so they can neither see with their eyes , nor understand with their hearts , nor turn – and I would heal them. ’ [ h ]
NIVUK	John	12	41	Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus ’ glory and spoke about him .
NIVUK	John	12	42	Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him . But because of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue ;
NIVUK	John	12	43	for they loved human praise more than praise from God .
NIVUK	John	12	44	Then Jesus cried out , ‘ Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only , but in the one who sent me .
NIVUK	John	12	45	The one who looks at me is seeing the one who sent me .
NIVUK	John	12	46	I have come into the world as a light , so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness .
NIVUK	John	12	47	‘ If anyone hears my words but does not keep them , I do not judge that person . For I did not come to judge the world , but to save the world .
NIVUK	John	12	48	There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words ; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day .
NIVUK	John	12	49	For I did not speak on my own , but the Father who sent me commanded me to say all that I have spoken .
NIVUK	John	12	50	I know that his command leads to eternal life . So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say. ’ Footnotes - John 12:5 Greek three hundred denarii - John 12:8 See Deut . 15:11 . - John 12:13 A Hebrew expression meaning ‘ Save ! ’ which became an exclamation of praise - John 12:13 Psalm 118:25,26 - John 12:15 Zech . 9:9 - John 12:32 The Greek for lifted up also means exalted . - John 12:38 Isaiah 53:1 - John 12:40 Isaiah 6:10 Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	John	13	13	‘ You call me “ Teacher ” and “ Lord ” , and rightly so , for that is what I am .
NIVUK	John	13	2	The evening meal was in progress , and the devil had already prompted Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot , to betray Jesus .
NIVUK	John	13	3	Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power , and that he had come from God and was returning to God ;
NIVUK	John	13	4	so he got up from the meal , took off his outer clothing , and wrapped a towel round his waist .
NIVUK	John	13	5	After that , he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples ’ feet , drying them with the towel that was wrapped round him .
NIVUK	John	13	6	He came to Simon Peter , who said to him , ‘ Lord , are you going to wash my feet ? ’
NIVUK	John	13	7	Jesus replied , ‘ You do not realise now what I am doing , but later you will understand. ’
NIVUK	John	13	8	‘ No , ’ said Peter , ‘ you shall never wash my feet. ’ Jesus answered , ‘ Unless I wash you , you have no part with me. ’
NIVUK	John	13	9	‘ Then , Lord , ’ Simon Peter replied , ‘ not just my feet but my hands and my head as well ! ’
NIVUK	John	13	10	Jesus answered , ‘ Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet ; their whole body is clean . And you are clean , though not every one of you. ’
NIVUK	John	13	11	For he knew who was going to betray him , and that was why he said not every one was clean .
NIVUK	John	13	12	When he had finished washing their feet , he put on his clothes and returned to his place . ‘ Do you understand what I have done for you ? ’ he asked them .
NIVUK	John	13	14	Now that I , your Lord and Teacher , have washed your feet , you also should wash one another ’ s feet .
NIVUK	John	13	15	I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you .
NIVUK	John	13	16	Very truly I tell you , no servant is greater than his master , nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him .
NIVUK	John	13	17	Now that you know these things , you will be blessed if you do them . Jesus predicts his betrayal
NIVUK	John	13	18	‘ I am not referring to all of you ; I know those I have chosen . But this is to fulfil this passage of Scripture : “ He who shared my bread has turned [ a ] against me. ” [ b ]
NIVUK	John	13	19	‘ I am telling you now before it happens , so that when it does happen you will believe that I am who I am .
NIVUK	John	13	20	Very truly I tell you , whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me ; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me. ’
NIVUK	John	13	21	After he had said this , Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified , ‘ Very truly I tell you , one of you is going to betray me. ’
NIVUK	John	13	22	His disciples stared at one another , at a loss to know which of them he meant .
NIVUK	John	13	23	One of them , the disciple whom Jesus loved , was reclining next to him .
NIVUK	John	13	24	Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said , ‘ Ask him which one he means. ’
NIVUK	John	13	25	Leaning back against Jesus , he asked him , ‘ Lord , who is it ? ’
NIVUK	John	13	26	Jesus answered , ‘ It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish. ’ Then , dipping the piece of bread , he gave it to Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot .
NIVUK	John	13	27	As soon as Judas took the bread , Satan entered into him . So Jesus told him , ‘ What you are about to do , do quickly. ’
NIVUK	John	13	28	But no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him .
NIVUK	John	13	29	Since Judas had charge of the money , some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the festival , or to give something to the poor .
NIVUK	John	13	30	As soon as Judas had taken the bread , he went out . And it was night . Jesus predicts Peter ’ s denial
NIVUK	John	13	31	When he was gone , Jesus said , ‘ Now the Son of Man is glorified and God is glorified in him .
NIVUK	John	13	32	If God is glorified in him , [ c ] God will glorify the Son in himself , and will glorify him at once .
NIVUK	John	13	33	‘ My children , I will be with you only a little longer . You will look for me , and just as I told the Jews , so I tell you now : where I am going , you can not come .
NIVUK	John	13	34	‘ A new command I give you : love one another . As I have loved you , so you must love one another .
NIVUK	John	13	35	By this everyone will know that you are my disciples , if you love one another. ’
NIVUK	John	13	36	Simon Peter asked him , ‘ Lord , where are you going ? ’ Jesus replied , ‘ Where I am going , you can not follow now , but you will follow later. ’
NIVUK	John	13	37	Peter asked , ‘ Lord , why can ’ t I follow you now ? I will lay down my life for you. ’
NIVUK	John	13	38	Then Jesus answered , ‘ Will you really lay down your life for me ? Very truly I tell you , before the cock crows , you will disown me three times !

NIVUK	John	14	14	You may ask me for anything in my name , and I will do it . Jesus promises the Holy Spirit
NIVUK	John	14	2	My Father ’ s house has many rooms ; if that were not so , would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you ?
NIVUK	John	14	3	And if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am .

NIVUK	John	14	5	Thomas said to him , ‘ Lord , we don ’ t know where you are going , so how can we know the way ? ’
NIVUK	John	14	6	Jesus answered , ‘ I am the way and the truth and the life . No one comes to the Father except through me .
NIVUK	John	14	7	If you really know me , you will know [ b ] my Father as well . From now on , you do know him and have seen him. ’
NIVUK	John	14	8	Philip said , ‘ Lord , show us the Father and that will be enough for us. ’
NIVUK	John	14	9	Jesus answered : ‘ Don ’ t you know me , Philip , even after I have been among you such a long time ? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father . How can you say , “ Show us the Father ” ?
NIVUK	John	14	10	Don ’ t you believe that I am in the Father , and that the Father is in me ? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority . Rather , it is the Father , living in me , who is doing his work .
NIVUK	John	14	11	Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me ; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves .
NIVUK	John	14	12	Very truly I tell you , whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing , and they will do even greater things than these , because I am going to the Father .
NIVUK	John	14	13	And I will do whatever you ask in my name , so that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
NIVUK	John	14	15	‘ If you love me , keep my commands .
NIVUK	John	14	16	And I will ask the Father , and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you for ever –

NIVUK	John	14	18	I will not leave you as orphans ; I will come to you .
NIVUK	John	14	19	Before long , the world will not see me any more , but you will see me . Because I live , you also will live .
NIVUK	John	14	20	On that day you will realise that I am in my Father , and you are in me , and I am in you .
NIVUK	John	14	21	Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me . The one who loves me will be loved by my Father , and I too will love them and show myself to them. ’
NIVUK	John	14	22	Then Judas ( not Judas Iscariot ) said , ‘ But , Lord , why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world ? ’
NIVUK	John	14	23	Jesus replied , ‘ Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching . My Father will love them , and we will come to them and make our home with them .
NIVUK	John	14	24	Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching . These words you hear are not my own ; they belong to the Father who sent me .

NIVUK	John	15	15	I no longer call you servants , because a servant does not know his master ’ s business . Instead , I have called you friends , for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you .
NIVUK	John	15	2	He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit , while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes [ a ] so that it will be even more fruitful .
NIVUK	John	15	3	You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you .
NIVUK	John	15	4	Remain in me , as I also remain in you . No branch can bear fruit by itself ; it must remain in the vine . Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me .
NIVUK	John	15	5	‘ I am the vine ; you are the branches . If you remain in me and I in you , you will bear much fruit ; apart from me you can do nothing .
NIVUK	John	15	6	If you do not remain in me , you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers ; such branches are picked up , thrown into the fire and burned .

NIVUK	John	15	10	If you keep my commands , you will remain in my love , just as I have kept my Father ’ s commands and remain in his love .
NIVUK	John	15	11	I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete .
NIVUK	John	15	12	My command is this : love each other as I have loved you .
NIVUK	John	15	13	Greater love has no one than this : to lay down one ’ s life for one ’ s friends .
NIVUK	John	15	14	You are my friends if you do what I command .
NIVUK	John	15	16	You did not choose me , but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit – fruit that will last – and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you .
NIVUK	John	15	17	This is my command : love each other . The world hates the disciples
NIVUK	John	15	18	‘ If the world hates you , keep in mind that it hated me first .
NIVUK	John	15	19	If you belonged to the world , it would love you as its own . As it is , you do not belong to the world , but I have chosen you out of the world . That is why the world hates you .
NIVUK	John	15	20	Remember what I told you : “ A servant is not greater than his master. ” [ b ] If they persecuted me , they will persecute you also . If they obeyed my teaching , they will obey yours also .
NIVUK	John	15	21	They will treat you this way because of my name , for they do not know the one who sent me .
NIVUK	John	15	22	If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not be guilty of sin ; but now they have no excuse for their sin .
NIVUK	John	15	23	Whoever hates me hates my Father as well .
NIVUK	John	15	24	If I had not done among them the works no one else did , they would not be guilty of sin . As it is , they have seen , and yet they have hated both me and my Father .
NIVUK	John	15	25	But this is to fulfil what is written in their Law : “ They hated me without reason. ” [ c ] The work of the Holy Spirit

NIVUK	John	16	2	They will put you out of the synagogue ; in fact , the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God .
NIVUK	John	16	3	They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me .
NIVUK	John	16	4	I have told you this , so that when their time comes you will remember that I warned you about them . I did not tell you this from the beginning because I was with you ,
NIVUK	John	16	5	but now I am going to him who sent me . None of you asks me , “ Where are you going ? ”
NIVUK	John	16	6	Rather , you are filled with grief because I have said these things .
NIVUK	John	16	7	But very truly I tell you , it is for your good that I am going away . Unless I go away , the Advocate will not come to you ; but if I go , I will send him to you .
NIVUK	John	16	8	When he comes , he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment :
NIVUK	John	16	9	about sin , because people do not believe in me ;
NIVUK	John	16	10	about righteousness , because I am going to the Father , where you can see me no longer ;
NIVUK	John	16	11	and about judgment , because the prince of this world now stands condemned .
NIVUK	John	16	12	‘ I have much more to say to you , more than you can now bear .
NIVUK	John	16	13	But when he , the Spirit of truth , comes , he will guide you into all the truth . He will not speak on his own ; he will speak only what he hears , and he will tell you what is yet to come .
NIVUK	John	16	14	He will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you .
NIVUK	John	16	15	All that belongs to the Father is mine . That is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what he will make known to you. ’ The disciples ’ grief will turn to joy
NIVUK	John	16	17	At this , some of his disciples said to one another , ‘ What does he mean by saying , “ In a little while you will see me no more , and then after a little while you will see me , ” and “ Because I am going to the Father ” ? ’
NIVUK	John	16	18	They kept asking , ‘ What does he mean by “ a little while ” ? We don ’ t understand what he is saying. ’
NIVUK	John	16	19	Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this , so he said to them , ‘ Are you asking one another what I meant when I said , “ In a little while you will see me no more , and then after a little while you will see me ” ?
NIVUK	John	16	20	Very truly I tell you , you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices . You will grieve , but your grief will turn to joy .
NIVUK	John	16	21	A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come ; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world .
NIVUK	John	16	22	So with you : now is your time of grief , but I will see you again and you will rejoice , and no one will take away your joy .
NIVUK	John	16	23	In that day you will no longer ask me anything . Very truly I tell you , my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name .
NIVUK	John	16	24	Until now you have not asked for anything in my name . Ask and you will receive , and your joy will be complete .
NIVUK	John	16	25	‘ Though I have been speaking figuratively , a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father .
NIVUK	John	16	26	In that day you will ask in my name . I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf .
NIVUK	John	16	27	No , the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God .
NIVUK	John	16	28	I came from the Father and entered the world ; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father. ’
NIVUK	John	16	29	Then Jesus ’ disciples said , ‘ Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech .
NIVUK	John	16	30	Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions . This makes us believe that you came from God. ’
NIVUK	John	16	31	‘ Do you now believe ? ’ Jesus replied .
NIVUK	John	16	32	‘ A time is coming and in fact has come when you will be scattered , each to your own home . You will leave me all alone . Yet I am not alone , for my Father is with me .
NIVUK	John	16	33	‘ I have told you these things , so that in me you may have peace . In this world you will have trouble . But take heart ! I have overcome the world. ’ Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	John	17	16	They are not of the world , even as I am not of it .

NIVUK	John	18	18	It was cold , and the servants and officials stood round a fire they had made to keep warm . Peter also was standing with them , warming himself . The high priest questions Jesus
NIVUK	John	18	2	Now Judas , who betrayed him , knew the place , because Jesus had often met there with his disciples .
NIVUK	John	18	3	So Judas came to the garden , guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and the Pharisees . They were carrying torches , lanterns and weapons .
NIVUK	John	18	4	Jesus , knowing all that was going to happen to him , went out and asked them , ‘ Who is it you want ? ’
NIVUK	John	18	5	‘ Jesus of Nazareth , ’ they replied . ‘ I am he , ’ Jesus said . ( And Judas the traitor was standing there with them . )
NIVUK	John	18	6	When Jesus said , ‘ I am he , ’ they drew back and fell to the ground .
NIVUK	John	18	7	Again he asked them , ‘ Who is it you want ? ’ ‘ Jesus of Nazareth , ’ they said .
NIVUK	John	18	8	Jesus answered , ‘ I told you that I am he . If you are looking for me , then let these men go. ’
NIVUK	John	18	9	This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled : ‘ I have not lost one of those you gave me. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	John	18	10	Then Simon Peter , who had a sword , drew it and struck the high priest ’ s servant , cutting off his right ear . ( The servant ’ s name was Malchus . )
NIVUK	John	18	11	Jesus commanded Peter , ‘ Put your sword away ! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me ? ’
NIVUK	John	18	12	Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus . They bound him
NIVUK	John	18	13	and brought him first to Annas , who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , the high priest that year .
NIVUK	John	18	14	Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be good if one man died for the people . Peter ’ s first denial
NIVUK	John	18	15	Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus . Because this disciple was known to the high priest , he went with Jesus into the high priest ’ s courtyard ,
NIVUK	John	18	16	but Peter had to wait outside at the door . The other disciple , who was known to the high priest , came back , spoke to the servant-girl on duty there and brought Peter in .
NIVUK	John	18	17	‘ You aren ’ t one of this man ’ s disciples too , are you ? ’ she asked Peter . He replied , ‘ I am not. ’
NIVUK	John	18	19	Meanwhile , the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching .
NIVUK	John	18	20	‘ I have spoken openly to the world , ’ Jesus replied . ‘ I always taught in synagogues or at the temple , where all the Jews come together . I said nothing in secret .
NIVUK	John	18	21	Why question me ? Ask those who heard me . Surely they know what I said. ’
NIVUK	John	18	22	When Jesus said this , one of the officials near by slapped him in the face . ‘ Is this the way you answer the high priest ? ’ he demanded .
NIVUK	John	18	23	‘ If I said something wrong , ’ Jesus replied , ‘ testify as to what is wrong . But if I spoke the truth , why did you strike me ? ’
NIVUK	John	18	24	Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest . Peter ’ s second and third denials
NIVUK	John	18	25	Meanwhile , Simon Peter was still standing there warming himself . So they asked him , ‘ You aren ’ t one of his disciples too , are you ? ’ He denied it , saying , ‘ I am not. ’
NIVUK	John	18	26	One of the high priest ’ s servants , a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off , challenged him , ‘ Didn ’ t I see you with him in the garden ? ’
NIVUK	John	18	27	Again Peter denied it , and at that moment a cock began to crow . Jesus before Pilate
NIVUK	John	18	28	Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor . By now it was early morning , and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness they did not enter the palace , because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover .
NIVUK	John	18	29	So Pilate came out to them and asked , ‘ What charges are you bringing against this man ? ’
NIVUK	John	18	30	‘ If he were not a criminal , ’ they replied , ‘ we would not have handed him over to you. ’
NIVUK	John	18	31	Pilate said , ‘ Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law. ’ ‘ But we have no right to execute anyone , ’ they objected .
NIVUK	John	18	32	This took place to fulfil what Jesus had said about the kind of death he was going to die .
NIVUK	John	18	33	Pilate then went back inside the palace , summoned Jesus and asked him , ‘ Are you the king of the Jews ? ’
NIVUK	John	18	34	‘ Is that your own idea , ’ Jesus asked , ‘ or did others talk to you about me ? ’
NIVUK	John	18	35	‘ Am I a Jew ? ’ Pilate replied . ‘ Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me . What is it you have done ? ’
NIVUK	John	18	36	Jesus said , ‘ My kingdom is not of this world . If it were , my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders . But now my kingdom is from another place. ’
NIVUK	John	18	37	‘ You are a king , then ! ’ said Pilate . Jesus answered , ‘ You say that I am a king . In fact , the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth . Everyone on the side of truth listens to me. ’
NIVUK	John	18	38	‘ What is truth ? ’ retorted Pilate . With this he went out again to the Jews gathered there and said , ‘ I find no basis for a charge against him .
NIVUK	John	18	39	But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover . Do you want me to release “ the king of the Jews ” ? ’
NIVUK	John	18	40	They shouted back , ‘ No , not him ! Give us Barabbas ! ’ Now Barabbas had taken part in an uprising . Footnotes - John 18:9 John 6:39 Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	John	19	19	Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross . It read : jesus of nazareth , the king of the jews .
NIVUK	John	19	2	The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head . They clothed him in a purple robe
NIVUK	John	19	3	and went up to him again and again , saying , ‘ Hail , king of the Jews ! ’ And they slapped him in the face .
NIVUK	John	19	4	Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews gathered there , ‘ Look , I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him. ’
NIVUK	John	19	5	When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe , Pilate said to them , ‘ Here is the man ! ’
NIVUK	John	19	6	As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him , they shouted , ‘ Crucify ! Crucify ! ’ But Pilate answered , ‘ You take him and crucify him . As for me , I find no basis for a charge against him. ’
NIVUK	John	19	7	The Jewish leaders insisted , ‘ We have a law , and according to that law he must die , because he claimed to be the Son of God. ’
NIVUK	John	19	8	When Pilate heard this , he was even more afraid ,
NIVUK	John	19	9	and he went back inside the palace . ‘ Where do you come from ? ’ he asked Jesus , but Jesus gave him no answer .
NIVUK	John	19	10	‘ Do you refuse to speak to me ? ’ Pilate said . ‘ Don ’ t you realise I have power either to free you or to crucify you ? ’
NIVUK	John	19	11	Jesus answered , ‘ You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above . Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin. ’
NIVUK	John	19	12	From then on , Pilate tried to set Jesus free , but the Jewish leaders kept shouting , ‘ If you let this man go , you are no friend of Caesar . Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar. ’
NIVUK	John	19	13	When Pilate heard this , he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge ’ s seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement ( which in Aramaic is Gabbatha ) .
NIVUK	John	19	14	It was the day of Preparation of the Passover ; it was about noon . ‘ Here is your king , ’ Pilate said to the Jews .
NIVUK	John	19	15	But they shouted , ‘ Take him away ! Take him away ! Crucify him ! ’ ‘ Shall I crucify your king ? ’ Pilate asked . ‘ We have no king but Caesar , ’ the chief priests answered .
NIVUK	John	19	16	Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified . The crucifixion of Jesus So the soldiers took charge of Jesus .
NIVUK	John	19	17	Carrying his own cross , he went out to the place of the Skull ( which in Aramaic is called Golgotha ) .
NIVUK	John	19	18	There they crucified him , and with him two others – one on each side and Jesus in the middle .
NIVUK	John	19	20	Many of the Jews read this sign , for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city , and the sign was written in Aramaic , Latin and Greek .
NIVUK	John	19	21	The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate , ‘ Do not write “ The King of the Jews ” , but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews. ’
NIVUK	John	19	22	Pilate answered , ‘ What I have written , I have written. ’
NIVUK	John	19	23	When the soldiers crucified Jesus , they took his clothes , dividing them into four shares , one for each of them , with the undergarment remaining . This garment was seamless , woven in one piece from top to bottom .
NIVUK	John	19	24	‘ Let ’ s not tear it , ’ they said to one another . ‘ Let ’ s decide by lot who will get it. ’ This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that said , ‘ They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment. ’ [ a ] So this is what the soldiers did .
NIVUK	John	19	25	Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother , his mother ’ s sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
NIVUK	John	19	26	When Jesus saw his mother there , and the disciple whom he loved standing near by , he said to her , ‘ Woman , [ b ] here is your son , ’
NIVUK	John	19	27	and to the disciple , ‘ Here is your mother. ’ From that time on , this disciple took her into his home . The death of Jesus
NIVUK	John	19	28	Later , knowing that everything had now been finished , and so that Scripture would be fulfilled , Jesus said , ‘ I am thirsty. ’
NIVUK	John	19	29	A jar of wine vinegar was there , so they soaked a sponge in it , put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant , and lifted it to Jesus ’ lips .
NIVUK	John	19	30	When he had received the drink , Jesus said , ‘ It is finished. ’ With that , he bowed his head and gave up his spirit .
NIVUK	John	19	31	Now it was the day of Preparation , and the next day was to be a special Sabbath . Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath , they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down .
NIVUK	John	19	32	The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus , and then those of the other .
NIVUK	John	19	33	But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead , they did not break his legs .
NIVUK	John	19	34	Instead , one of the soldiers pierced Jesus ’ side with a spear , bringing a sudden flow of blood and water .
NIVUK	John	19	35	The man who saw it has given testimony , and his testimony is true . He knows that he tells the truth , and he testifies so that you also may believe .
NIVUK	John	19	36	These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled : ‘ Not one of his bones will be broken , ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	John	19	37	and , as another scripture says , ‘ They will look on the one they have pierced. ’ [ d ] The burial of Jesus
NIVUK	John	19	38	Later , Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus . Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus , but secretly because he feared the Jewish leaders . With Pilate ’ s permission , he came and took the body away .
NIVUK	John	19	39	He was accompanied by Nicodemus , the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night . Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about thirty-five kilograms .
NIVUK	John	19	40	Taking Jesus ’ body , the two of them wrapped it , with the spices , in strips of linen . This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs .
NIVUK	John	19	41	At the place where Jesus was crucified , there was a garden , and in the garden a new tomb , in which no one had ever been laid .
NIVUK	John	19	42	Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was near by , they laid Jesus there .

NIVUK	John	20	20	After he said this , he showed them his hands and side . The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord .
NIVUK	John	20	2	So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple , the one Jesus loved , and said , ‘ They have taken the Lord out of the tomb , and we don ’ t know where they have put him ! ’
NIVUK	John	20	3	So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb .
NIVUK	John	20	4	Both were running , but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first .
NIVUK	John	20	5	He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in .
NIVUK	John	20	6	Then Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb . He saw the strips of linen lying there ,
NIVUK	John	20	7	as well as the cloth that had been wrapped round Jesus ’ head . The cloth was still lying in its place , separate from the linen .
NIVUK	John	20	8	Finally the other disciple , who had reached the tomb first , also went inside . He saw and believed .
NIVUK	John	20	9	( They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead . )
NIVUK	John	20	10	Then the disciples went back to where they were staying . Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene
NIVUK	John	20	11	Now Mary stood outside the tomb crying . As she wept , she bent over to look into the tomb
NIVUK	John	20	12	and saw two angels in white , seated where Jesus ’ body had been , one at the head and the other at the foot .
NIVUK	John	20	13	They asked her , ‘ Woman , why are you crying ? ’ ‘ They have taken my Lord away , ’ she said , ‘ and I don ’ t know where they have put him. ’
NIVUK	John	20	14	At this , she turned round and saw Jesus standing there , but she did not realise that it was Jesus .
NIVUK	John	20	15	He asked her , ‘ Woman , why are you crying ? Who is it you are looking for ? ’ Thinking he was the gardener , she said , ‘ Sir , if you have carried him away , tell me where you have put him , and I will get him. ’
NIVUK	John	20	16	Jesus said to her , ‘ Mary. ’ She turned towards him and cried out in Aramaic , ‘ Rabboni ! ’ ( which means ‘ Teacher ’ ) .
NIVUK	John	20	17	Jesus said , ‘ Do not hold on to me , for I have not yet ascended to the Father . Go instead to my brothers and tell them , “ I am ascending to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God. ” ’
NIVUK	John	20	18	Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news : ‘ I have seen the Lord ! ’ And she told them that he had said these things to her . Jesus appears to his disciples
NIVUK	John	20	19	On the evening of that first day of the week , when the disciples were together , with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders , Jesus came and stood among them and said , ‘ Peace be with you ! ’
NIVUK	John	20	21	Again Jesus said , ‘ Peace be with you ! As the Father has sent me , I am sending you. ’
NIVUK	John	20	22	And with that he breathed on them and said , ‘ Receive the Holy Spirit .
NIVUK	John	20	23	If you forgive anyone ’ s sins , their sins are forgiven ; if you do not forgive them , they are not forgiven. ’ Jesus appears to Thomas
NIVUK	John	20	24	Now Thomas ( also known as Didymus [ a ] ) , one of the Twelve , was not with the disciples when Jesus came .
NIVUK	John	20	25	So the other disciples told him , ‘ We have seen the Lord ! ’ But he said to them , ‘ Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were , and put my hand into his side , I will not believe. ’
NIVUK	John	20	26	A week later his disciples were in the house again , and Thomas was with them . Though the doors were locked , Jesus came and stood among them and said , ‘ Peace be with you ! ’
NIVUK	John	20	27	Then he said to Thomas , ‘ Put your finger here ; see my hands . Reach out your hand and put it into my side . Stop doubting and believe. ’
NIVUK	John	20	28	Thomas said to him , ‘ My Lord and my God ! ’
NIVUK	John	20	29	Then Jesus told him , ‘ Because you have seen me , you have believed ; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed. ’ The purpose of John ’ s gospel
NIVUK	John	20	30	Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples , which are not recorded in this book .
NIVUK	John	20	31	But these are written that you may believe [ b ] that Jesus is the Messiah , the Son of God , and that by believing you may have life in his name .

NIVUK	John	21	21	When Peter saw him , he asked , ‘ Lord , what about him ? ’
NIVUK	John	21	2	Simon Peter , Thomas ( also known as Didymus [ b ] ) , Nathanael from Cana in Galilee , the sons of Zebedee , and two other disciples were together .
NIVUK	John	21	3	‘ I ’ m going out to fish , ’ Simon Peter told them , and they said , ‘ We ’ ll go with you. ’ So they went out and got into the boat , but that night they caught nothing .
NIVUK	John	21	4	Early in the morning , Jesus stood on the shore , but the disciples did not realise that it was Jesus .
NIVUK	John	21	5	He called out to them , ‘ Friends , haven ’ t you any fish ? ’ ‘ No , ’ they answered .
NIVUK	John	21	6	He said , ‘ Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some. ’ When they did , they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish .
NIVUK	John	21	7	Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter , ‘ It is the Lord ! ’ As soon as Simon Peter heard him say , ‘ It is the Lord , ’ he wrapped his outer garment round him ( for he had taken it off ) and jumped into the water .
NIVUK	John	21	8	The other disciples followed in the boat , towing the net full of fish , for they were not far from shore , about a hundred metres .
NIVUK	John	21	9	When they landed , they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it , and some bread .
NIVUK	John	21	10	Jesus said to them , ‘ Bring some of the fish you have just caught. ’
NIVUK	John	21	11	So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore . It was full of large fish ,
NIVUK	John	21	153	, but even with so many the net was not torn .
NIVUK	John	21	12	Jesus said to them , ‘ Come and have breakfast. ’ None of the disciples dared ask him , ‘ Who are you ? ’ They knew it was the Lord .
NIVUK	John	21	13	Jesus came , took the bread and gave it to them , and did the same with the fish .
NIVUK	John	21	14	This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead . Jesus reinstates Peter
NIVUK	John	21	15	When they had finished eating , Jesus said to Simon Peter , ‘ Simon son of John , do you love me more than these ? ’ ‘ Yes , Lord , ’ he said , ‘ you know that I love you. ’ Jesus said , ‘ Feed my lambs. ’
NIVUK	John	21	16	Again Jesus said , ‘ Simon son of John , do you love me ? ’ He answered , ‘ Yes , Lord , you know that I love you. ’ Jesus said , ‘ Take care of my sheep. ’
NIVUK	John	21	17	The third time he said to him , ‘ Simon son of John , do you love me ? ’ Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time , ‘ Do you love me ? ’ He said , ‘ Lord , you know all things ; you know that I love you. ’ Jesus said , ‘ Feed my sheep .
NIVUK	John	21	18	Very truly I tell you , when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted ; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands , and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go. ’
NIVUK	John	21	19	Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God . Then he said to him , ‘ Follow me ! ’
NIVUK	John	21	20	Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them . ( This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said , ‘ Lord , who is going to betray you ? ’ )
NIVUK	John	21	22	Jesus answered , ‘ If I want him to remain alive until I return , what is that to you ? You must follow me. ’
NIVUK	John	21	23	Because of this , the rumour spread among the believers that this disciple would not die . But Jesus did not say that he would not die ; he only said , ‘ If I want him to remain alive until I return , what is that to you ? ’
NIVUK	John	21	24	This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down . We know that his testimony is true .
NIVUK	John	21	25	Jesus did many other things as well . If every one of them were written down , I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Romans	1	2	the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures
NIVUK	Romans	1	3	regarding his Son , who as to his earthly life [ a ] was a descendant of David ,
NIVUK	Romans	1	4	; 8:12 ,
NIVUK	Romans	1	5	Through him we received grace and apostleship to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from [ c ] faith for his name ’ s sake .
NIVUK	Romans	1	6	And you also are among those Gentiles who are called to belong to Jesus Christ .
NIVUK	Romans	1	7	To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be his holy people : Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ . Paul ’ s longing to visit Rome
NIVUK	Romans	1	8	First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , because your faith is being reported all over the world .
NIVUK	Romans	1	9	God , whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his Son , is my witness how constantly I remember you
NIVUK	Romans	1	10	in my prayers at all times ; and I pray that now at last by God ’ s will the way may be opened for me to come to you .
NIVUK	Romans	1	11	I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong –
NIVUK	Romans	1	12	that is , that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other ’ s faith .
NIVUK	Romans	1	13	I do not want you to be unaware , brothers and sisters , [ d ] that I planned many times to come to you ( but have been prevented from doing so until now ) in order that I might have a harvest among you , just as I have had among the other Gentiles .
NIVUK	Romans	1	14	I am a debtor both to Greeks and non-Greeks , both to the wise and the foolish .
NIVUK	Romans	1	15	That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome .
NIVUK	Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel , because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes : first to the Jew , then to the Gentile .

NIVUK	Romans	1	18	The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people , who suppress the truth by their wickedness ,
NIVUK	Romans	1	19	since what may be known about God is plain to them , because God has made it plain to them .
NIVUK	Romans	1	20	For since the creation of the world God ’ s invisible qualities – his eternal power and divine nature – have been clearly seen , being understood from what has been made , so that people are without excuse .
NIVUK	Romans	1	21	For although they knew God , they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him , but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened .
NIVUK	Romans	1	22	Although they claimed to be wise , they became fools
NIVUK	Romans	1	23	and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles .
NIVUK	Romans	1	24	Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another .
NIVUK	Romans	1	25	They exchanged the truth about God for a lie , and worshipped and served created things rather than the Creator – who is for ever praised . Amen .
NIVUK	Romans	1	26	Because of this , God gave them over to shameful lusts . Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones .
NIVUK	Romans	1	27	In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another . Men committed shameful acts with other men , and received in themselves the due penalty for their error .
NIVUK	Romans	1	28	Furthermore , just as they did not think it worth while to retain the knowledge of God , so God gave them over to a depraved mind , so that they do what ought not to be done .
NIVUK	Romans	1	29	; 10:1 ; 11:25 ; 12:1 ; 15:14 ,
NIVUK	Romans	1	30	; 16:14 ,
NIVUK	Romans	1	31	they have no understanding , no fidelity , no love , no mercy .
NIVUK	Romans	1	32	Although they know God ’ s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death , they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practise them . Footnotes - Romans 1:3 Or who according to the flesh - Romans 1:4 Or was declared with power to be the Son of God - Romans 1:5 Or that is - Romans 1:13 The Greek word for brothers and sisters ( adelphoi ) refers here to believers , both men and women , as part of God ’ s family ; also in 7:1 ,

NIVUK	Romans	2	2	Now we know that God ’ s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth .
NIVUK	Romans	2	3	So when you , a mere human being , pass judgment on them and yet do the same things , do you think you will escape God ’ s judgment ?
NIVUK	Romans	2	4	Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness , forbearance and patience , not realising that God ’ s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance ?
NIVUK	Romans	2	5	But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart , you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God ’ s wrath , when his righteous judgment will be revealed .
NIVUK	Romans	2	6	God ‘ will repay each person according to what they have done. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	Romans	2	7	To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory , honour and immortality , he will give eternal life .
NIVUK	Romans	2	8	But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil , there will be wrath and anger .
NIVUK	Romans	2	9	There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil : first for the Jew , then for the Gentile ;
NIVUK	Romans	2	10	but glory , honour and peace for everyone who does good : first for the Jew , then for the Gentile .
NIVUK	Romans	2	11	For God does not show favouritism .
NIVUK	Romans	2	12	All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law , and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law .
NIVUK	Romans	2	13	For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God ’ s sight , but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous .
NIVUK	Romans	2	14	( Indeed , when Gentiles , who do not have the law , do by nature things required by the law , they are a law for themselves , even though they do not have the law .
NIVUK	Romans	2	15	They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts , their consciences also bearing witness , and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them . )
NIVUK	Romans	2	16	This will take place on the day when God judges people ’ s secrets through Jesus Christ , as my gospel declares . The Jews and the law
NIVUK	Romans	2	17	Now you , if you call yourself a Jew ; if you rely on the law and boast in God ;
NIVUK	Romans	2	18	if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law ;
NIVUK	Romans	2	19	if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind , a light for those who are in the dark ,
NIVUK	Romans	2	20	an instructor of the foolish , a teacher of little children , because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth –
NIVUK	Romans	2	21	you , then , who teach others , do you not teach yourself ? You who preach against stealing , do you steal ?
NIVUK	Romans	2	22	You who say that people should not commit adultery , do you commit adultery ? You who abhor idols , do you rob temples ?
NIVUK	Romans	2	23	You who boast in the law , do you dishonour God by breaking the law ?
NIVUK	Romans	2	24	As it is written : ‘ God ’ s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	Romans	2	25	Circumcision has value if you observe the law , but if you break the law , you have become as though you had not been circumcised .
NIVUK	Romans	2	26	So then , if those who are not circumcised keep the law ’ s requirements , will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised ?
NIVUK	Romans	2	27	The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who , even though you have the [ c ] written code and circumcision , are a law-breaker .
NIVUK	Romans	2	28	A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly , nor is circumcision merely outward and physical .
NIVUK	Romans	2	29	No , a person is a Jew who is one inwardly ; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart , by the Spirit , not by the written code . Such a person ’ s praise is not from other people , but from God .

NIVUK	Romans	3	3	What if some were unfaithful ? Will their unfaithfulness nullify God ’ s faithfulness ?
NIVUK	Romans	3	2	Much in every way ! First of all , the Jews have been entrusted with the very words of God .
NIVUK	Romans	3	4	Not at all ! Let God be true , and every human being a liar . As it is written : ‘ So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness brings out God ’ s righteousness more clearly , what shall we say ? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us ? ( I am using a human argument . )
NIVUK	Romans	3	6	Certainly not ! If that were so , how could God judge the world ?
NIVUK	Romans	3	7	Someone might argue , ‘ If my falsehood enhances God ’ s truthfulness and so increases his glory , why am I still condemned as a sinner ? ’
NIVUK	Romans	3	8	Why not say – as some slanderously claim that we say – ‘ Let us do evil that good may result ’ ? Their condemnation is just ! No one is righteous
NIVUK	Romans	3	9	What shall we conclude then ? Do we have any advantage ? Not at all ! For we have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin .
NIVUK	Romans	3	10	As it is written : ‘ There is no one righteous , not even one ;
NIVUK	Romans	3	11	there is no one who understands ; there is no one who seeks God .
NIVUK	Romans	3	12	All have turned away , they have together become worthless ; there is no one who does good , not even one. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	Romans	3	13	‘ Their throats are open graves ; their tongues practise deceit. ’ [ c ] ‘ The poison of vipers is on their lips. ’ [ d ]
NIVUK	Romans	3	14	‘ Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness. ’ [ e ]
NIVUK	Romans	3	15	‘ Their feet are swift to shed blood ;
NIVUK	Romans	3	16	ruin and misery mark their ways ,
NIVUK	Romans	3	17	and the way of peace they do not know. ’ [ f ]
NIVUK	Romans	3	18	‘ There is no fear of God before their eyes. ’ [ g ]
NIVUK	Romans	3	19	Now we know that whatever the law says , it says to those who are under the law , so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God .
NIVUK	Romans	3	20	Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God ’ s sight by the works of the law ; rather , through the law we become conscious of our sin . Righteousness through faith
NIVUK	Romans	3	21	But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known , to which the Law and the Prophets testify .
NIVUK	Romans	3	22	This righteousness is given through faith in [ h ] Jesus Christ to all who believe . There is no difference between Jew and Gentile ,
NIVUK	Romans	3	23	for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God ,
NIVUK	Romans	3	24	and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus .
NIVUK	Romans	3	25	God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement , [ i ] through the shedding of his blood – to be received by faith . He did this to demonstrate his righteousness , because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished
NIVUK	Romans	3	26	– he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time , so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus .
NIVUK	Romans	3	27	Where , then , is boasting ? It is excluded . Because of what law ? The law that requires works ? No , because of the ‘ law ’ that requires faith .
NIVUK	Romans	3	28	For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law .
NIVUK	Romans	3	29	Or is God the God of Jews only ? Is he not the God of Gentiles too ? Yes , of Gentiles too ,
NIVUK	Romans	3	30	since there is only one God , who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith .
NIVUK	Romans	3	31	Do we , then , nullify the law by this faith ? Not at all ! Rather , we uphold the law .

NIVUK	Romans	4	4	Now to the one who works , wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation .
NIVUK	Romans	4	2	If , in fact , Abraham was justified by works , he had something to boast about – but not before God .
NIVUK	Romans	4	3	What does Scripture say ? ‘ Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	Romans	4	5	However , to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly , their faith is credited as righteousness .
NIVUK	Romans	4	6	David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works :
NIVUK	Romans	4	7	‘ Blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven , whose sins are covered .
NIVUK	Romans	4	8	Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord will never count against them. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	Romans	4	9	Is this blessedness only for the circumcised , or also for the uncircumcised ? We have been saying that Abraham ’ s faith was credited to him as righteousness .
NIVUK	Romans	4	10	Under what circumstances was it credited ? Was it after he was circumcised , or before ? It was not after , but before !
NIVUK	Romans	4	11	And he received circumcision as a sign , a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised . So then , he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised , in order that righteousness might be credited to them .
NIVUK	Romans	4	12	And he is then also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised .
NIVUK	Romans	4	13	It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world , but through the righteousness that comes by faith .
NIVUK	Romans	4	14	For if those who depend on the law are heirs , faith means nothing and the promise is worthless ,
NIVUK	Romans	4	15	because the law brings wrath . And where there is no law there is no transgression .
NIVUK	Romans	4	16	Therefore , the promise comes by faith , so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham ’ s offspring – not only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of Abraham . He is the father of us all .
NIVUK	Romans	4	17	As it is written : ‘ I have made you a father of many nations. ’ [ c ] He is our father in the sight of God , in whom he believed – the God who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that were not .
NIVUK	Romans	4	18	Against all hope , Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations , just as it had been said to him , ‘ So shall your offspring be. ’ [ d ]
NIVUK	Romans	4	19	Without weakening in his faith , he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead – since he was about a hundred years old – and that Sarah ’ s womb was also dead .
NIVUK	Romans	4	20	Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God , but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God ,
NIVUK	Romans	4	21	being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised .

NIVUK	Romans	4	23	The words ‘ it was credited to him ’ were written not for him alone ,
NIVUK	Romans	4	24	but also for us , to whom God will credit righteousness – for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead .
NIVUK	Romans	4	25	He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification . Footnotes - Romans 4:3 Gen. 15:6 ; also in verse

NIVUK	Romans	5	5	And hope does not put us to shame , because God ’ s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit , who has been given to us .
NIVUK	Romans	5	2	through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand . And we [ b ] boast in the hope of the glory of God .
NIVUK	Romans	5	3	Not only so , but we [ c ] also glory in our sufferings , because we know that suffering produces perseverance ;
NIVUK	Romans	5	4	perseverance , character ; and character , hope .
NIVUK	Romans	5	6	You see , at just the right time , when we were still powerless , Christ died for the ungodly .
NIVUK	Romans	5	7	Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person , though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die .
NIVUK	Romans	5	8	But God demonstrates his own love for us in this : while we were still sinners , Christ died for us .
NIVUK	Romans	5	9	Since we have now been justified by his blood , how much more shall we be saved from God ’ s wrath through him !
NIVUK	Romans	5	10	For if , while we were God ’ s enemies , we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son , how much more , having been reconciled , shall we be saved through his life !
NIVUK	Romans	5	11	Not only is this so , but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received reconciliation . Death through Adam , life through Christ
NIVUK	Romans	5	12	Therefore , just as sin entered the world through one man , and death through sin , and in this way death came to all people , because all sinned –
NIVUK	Romans	5	13	To be sure , sin was in the world before the law was given , but sin is not charged against anyone ’ s account where there is no law .
NIVUK	Romans	5	14	Nevertheless , death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses , even over those who did not sin by breaking a command , as did Adam , who is a pattern of the one to come .
NIVUK	Romans	5	15	But the gift is not like the trespass . For if the many died by the trespass of the one man , how much more did God ’ s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man , Jesus Christ , overflow to the many !
NIVUK	Romans	5	16	Nor can the gift of God be compared with the result of one man ’ s sin : the judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation , but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification .
NIVUK	Romans	5	17	For if , by the trespass of the one man , death reigned through that one man , how much more will those who receive God ’ s abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man , Jesus Christ !
NIVUK	Romans	5	18	Consequently , just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people , so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people .
NIVUK	Romans	5	19	For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners , so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous .
NIVUK	Romans	5	20	The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase . But where sin increased , grace increased all the more ,
NIVUK	Romans	5	21	so that , just as sin reigned in death , so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .

NIVUK	Romans	6	6	For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with , [ a ] that we should no longer be slaves to sin –
NIVUK	Romans	6	2	By no means ! We are those who have died to sin ; how can we live in it any longer ?
NIVUK	Romans	6	3	Or don ’ t you know that all of us who were baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into his death ?
NIVUK	Romans	6	4	We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that , just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , we too may live a new life .
NIVUK	Romans	6	5	For if we have been united with him in a death like his , we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his .
NIVUK	Romans	6	7	because anyone who has died has been set free from sin .
NIVUK	Romans	6	8	Now if we died with Christ , we believe that we will also live with him .
NIVUK	Romans	6	9	For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead , he can not die again ; death no longer has mastery over him .
NIVUK	Romans	6	10	The death he died , he died to sin once for all ; but the life he lives , he lives to God .
NIVUK	Romans	6	11	In the same way , count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus .
NIVUK	Romans	6	12	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires .
NIVUK	Romans	6	13	Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness , but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life ; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness .
NIVUK	Romans	6	14	For sin shall no longer be your master , because you are not under the law , but under grace . Slaves to righteousness
NIVUK	Romans	6	15	What then ? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace ? By no means !
NIVUK	Romans	6	16	Don ’ t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves , you are slaves of the one you obey – whether you are slaves to sin , which leads to death , or to obedience , which leads to righteousness ?
NIVUK	Romans	6	17	But thanks be to God that , though you used to be slaves to sin , you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance .
NIVUK	Romans	6	18	You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness .
NIVUK	Romans	6	19	I am using an example from everyday life because of your human limitations . Just as you used to offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness , so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness leading to holiness .
NIVUK	Romans	6	20	When you were slaves to sin , you were free from the control of righteousness .
NIVUK	Romans	6	21	What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of ? Those things result in death !
NIVUK	Romans	6	22	But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God , the benefit you reap leads to holiness , and the result is eternal life .
NIVUK	Romans	6	23	For the wages of sin is death , but the gift of God is eternal life in [ b ] Christ Jesus our Lord . Footnotes - Romans 6:6 Or be rendered powerless - Romans 6:23 Or through Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Romans	7	7	What shall we say , then ? Is the law sinful ? Certainly not ! Nevertheless , I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law . For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said , ‘ You shall not covet. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	Romans	7	2	For example , by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive , but if her husband dies , she is released from the law that binds her to him .
NIVUK	Romans	7	3	So then , if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive , she is called an adulteress . But if her husband dies , she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man .
NIVUK	Romans	7	4	So , my brothers and sisters , you also died to the law through the body of Christ , that you might belong to another , to him who was raised from the dead , in order that we might bear fruit for God .
NIVUK	Romans	7	5	For when we were in the realm of the flesh , [ a ] the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us , so that we bore fruit for death .
NIVUK	Romans	7	6	But now , by dying to what once bound us , we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit , and not in the old way of the written code . The law and sin
NIVUK	Romans	7	8	But sin , seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment , produced in me every kind of coveting . For apart from the law , sin was dead .
NIVUK	Romans	7	9	Once I was alive apart from the law ; but when the commandment came , sin sprang to life and I died .
NIVUK	Romans	7	10	I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death .
NIVUK	Romans	7	11	For sin , seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment , deceived me , and through the commandment put me to death .
NIVUK	Romans	7	12	So then , the law is holy , and the commandment is holy , righteous and good .
NIVUK	Romans	7	13	Did that which is good , then , become death to me ? By no means ! Nevertheless , in order that sin might be recognised as sin , it used what is good to bring about my death , so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful .
NIVUK	Romans	7	14	We know that the law is spiritual ; but I am unspiritual , sold as a slave to sin .
NIVUK	Romans	7	15	I do not understand what I do . For what I want to do I do not do , but what I hate I do .
NIVUK	Romans	7	16	And if I do what I do not want to do , I agree that the law is good .
NIVUK	Romans	7	17	As it is , it is no longer I myself who do it , but it is sin living in me .
NIVUK	Romans	7	18	For I know that good itself does not dwell in me , that is , in my sinful nature . [ c ] For I have the desire to do what is good , but I can not carry it out .
NIVUK	Romans	7	19	For I do not do the good I want to do , but the evil I do not want to do – this I keep on doing .
NIVUK	Romans	7	20	Now if I do what I do not want to do , it is no longer I who do it , but it is sin living in me that does it .
NIVUK	Romans	7	21	So I find this law at work : although I want to do good , evil is right there with me .
NIVUK	Romans	7	22	For in my inner being I delight in God ’ s law ;
NIVUK	Romans	7	23	but I see another law at work in me , waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me .
NIVUK	Romans	7	24	What a wretched man I am ! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death ?
NIVUK	Romans	7	25	Thanks be to God , who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So then , I myself in my mind am a slave to God ’ s law , but in my sinful nature [ d ] a slave to the law of sin .

NIVUK	Romans	8	3	For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh , [ b ] God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering . [ c ] And so he condemned sin in the flesh ,
NIVUK	Romans	8	4	in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us , who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit .
NIVUK	Romans	8	5	Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires ; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires .
NIVUK	Romans	8	6	The mind governed by the flesh is death , but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace .
NIVUK	Romans	8	7	The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God ; it does not submit to God ’ s law , nor can it do so .
NIVUK	Romans	8	9	You , however , are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit , if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you . And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ , they do not belong to Christ .
NIVUK	Romans	8	10	But if Christ is in you , then even though your body is subject to death because of sin , the Spirit gives life [ d ] because of righteousness .
NIVUK	Romans	8	11	And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you , he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of [ e ] his Spirit who lives in you .
NIVUK	Romans	8	12	Therefore , brothers and sisters , we have an obligation – but it is not to the flesh , to live according to it .
NIVUK	Romans	8	13	For if you live according to the flesh , you will die ; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body , you will live .
NIVUK	Romans	8	14	For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God .
NIVUK	Romans	8	15	The Spirit you received does not make you slaves , so that you live in fear again ; rather , the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship . [ f ] And by him we cry , ‘ Abba , [ g ] Father. ’
NIVUK	Romans	8	16	The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God ’ s children .
NIVUK	Romans	8	17	Now if we are children , then we are heirs – heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ , if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory . Present suffering and future glory
NIVUK	Romans	8	18	I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us .
NIVUK	Romans	8	19	For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed .
NIVUK	Romans	8	20	For the creation was subjected to frustration , not by its own choice , but by the will of the one who subjected it , in hope

NIVUK	Romans	8	22	We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time .
NIVUK	Romans	8	23	. - Romans 8:15 Aramaic for father - Romans 8:21 Or subjected it in hope .
NIVUK	Romans	8	24	For in this hope we were saved . But hope that is seen is no hope at all . Who hopes for what they already have ?
NIVUK	Romans	8	25	But if we hope for what we do not yet have , we wait for it patiently .
NIVUK	Romans	8	26	In the same way , the Spirit helps us in our weakness . We do not know what we ought to pray for , but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans .
NIVUK	Romans	8	27	And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit , because the Spirit intercedes for God ’ s people in accordance with the will of God .
NIVUK	Romans	8	28	And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him , who [ i ] have been called according to his purpose .
NIVUK	Romans	8	29	For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters .
NIVUK	Romans	8	30	And those he predestined , he also called ; those he called , he also justified ; those he justified , he also glorified . More than conquerors
NIVUK	Romans	8	31	What , then , shall we say in response to these things ? If God is for us , who can be against us ?
NIVUK	Romans	8	32	He who did not spare his own Son , but gave him up for us all – how will he not also , along with him , graciously give us all things ?
NIVUK	Romans	8	33	Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen ? It is God who justifies .
NIVUK	Romans	8	34	Who then is the one who condemns ? No one . Christ Jesus who died – more than that , who was raised to life – is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us .
NIVUK	Romans	8	35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword ?
NIVUK	Romans	8	36	As it is written : ‘ For your sake we face death all day long ; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered. ’ [ j ]
NIVUK	Romans	8	37	No , in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us .
NIVUK	Romans	8	38	For I am convinced that neither death nor life , neither angels nor demons , [ k ] neither the present nor the future , nor any powers ,
NIVUK	Romans	8	39	neither height nor depth , nor anything else in all creation , will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord .

NIVUK	Romans	9	9	For this was how the promise was stated : ‘ At the appointed time I will return , and Sarah will have a son. ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	Romans	9	2	I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart .
NIVUK	Romans	9	3	For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people , those of my own race ,
NIVUK	Romans	9	4	the people of Israel . Theirs is the adoption to sonship ; theirs the divine glory , the covenants , the receiving of the law , the temple worship and the promises .
NIVUK	Romans	9	5	Theirs are the patriarchs , and from them is traced the human ancestry of the Messiah , who is God over all , for ever praised ! [ a ] Amen . God ’ s sovereign choice
NIVUK	Romans	9	6	It is not as though God ’ s word had failed . For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel .
NIVUK	Romans	9	7	Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham ’ s children . On the contrary , ‘ It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	Romans	9	8	In other words , it is not the children by physical descent who are God ’ s children , but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham ’ s offspring .
NIVUK	Romans	9	10	Not only that , but Rebekah ’ s children were conceived at the same time by our father Isaac .
NIVUK	Romans	9	11	Yet , before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad – in order that God ’ s purpose in election might stand :
NIVUK	Romans	9	12	not by works but by him who calls – she was told , ‘ The older will serve the younger. ’ [ d ]
NIVUK	Romans	9	13	Just as it is written : ‘ Jacob I loved , but Esau I hated. ’ [ e ]
NIVUK	Romans	9	14	What then shall we say ? Is God unjust ? Not at all !
NIVUK	Romans	9	15	For he says to Moses , ‘ I will have mercy on whom I have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion. ’ [ f ]
NIVUK	Romans	9	16	It does not , therefore , depend on human desire or effort , but on God ’ s mercy .
NIVUK	Romans	9	17	For Scripture says to Pharaoh : ‘ I raised you up for this very purpose , that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth. ’ [ g ]
NIVUK	Romans	9	18	Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy , and he hardens whom he wants to harden .
NIVUK	Romans	9	19	One of you will say to me : ‘ Then why does God still blame us ? For who is able to resist his will ? ’
NIVUK	Romans	9	20	But who are you , a human being , to talk back to God ? ‘ Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it , “ Why did you make me like this ? ” ’ [ h ]
NIVUK	Romans	9	21	Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use ?
NIVUK	Romans	9	22	What if God , although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known , bore with great patience the objects of his wrath – prepared for destruction ?
NIVUK	Romans	9	23	What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy , whom he prepared in advance for glory –
NIVUK	Romans	9	24	even us , whom he also called , not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles ?
NIVUK	Romans	9	25	As he says in Hosea : ‘ I will call them “ my people ” who are not my people ; and I will call her “ my loved one ” who is not my loved one , ’ [ i ]
NIVUK	Romans	9	26	and , ‘ In the very place where it was said to them , “ You are not my people , ” there they will be called “ children of the living God. ” ’ [ j ]
NIVUK	Romans	9	27	Isaiah cries out concerning Israel : ‘ Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea , only the remnant will be saved .
NIVUK	Romans	9	28	For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality. ’ [ k ]
NIVUK	Romans	9	29	It is just as Isaiah said previously : ‘ Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants , we would have become like Sodom , we would have been like Gomorrah. ’ [ l ] Israel ’ s unbelief
NIVUK	Romans	9	30	What then shall we say ? That the Gentiles , who did not pursue righteousness , have obtained it , a righteousness that is by faith ;
NIVUK	Romans	9	31	but the people of Israel , who pursued the law as the way of righteousness , have not attained their goal .
NIVUK	Romans	9	32	Why not ? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works . They stumbled over the ‘ stumbling stone. ’
NIVUK	Romans	9	33	As it is written : ‘ See , I lay in Zion a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall , and the one who believes in him will never be put to shame. ’ [ m ] Footnotes - Romans 9:5 Or Messiah , who is over all .

NIVUK	Romans	10	10	For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified , and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved .
NIVUK	Romans	10	2	For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God , but their zeal is not based on knowledge .
NIVUK	Romans	10	3	Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own , they did not submit to God ’ s righteousness .
NIVUK	Romans	10	4	Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes .
NIVUK	Romans	10	5	Moses writes this about the righteousness that is by the law : ‘ The person who does these things will live by them. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	Romans	10	6	But the righteousness that is by faith says : ‘ Do not say in your heart , “ Who will ascend into heaven ? ” ’ [ b ] ( that is , to bring Christ down )
NIVUK	Romans	10	7	‘ or “ Who will descend into the deep ? ” ’ [ c ] ( that is , to bring Christ up from the dead ) .
NIVUK	Romans	10	8	But what does it say ? ‘ The word is near you ; it is in your mouth and in your heart , ’ [ d ] that is , the message concerning faith that we proclaim :
NIVUK	Romans	10	9	if you declare with your mouth , ‘ Jesus is Lord , ’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
NIVUK	Romans	10	11	As Scripture says , ‘ Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame. ’ [ e ]
NIVUK	Romans	10	12	For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile – the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him ,
NIVUK	Romans	10	13	for , ‘ Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. ’ [ f ]
NIVUK	Romans	10	14	How , then , can they call on the one they have not believed in ? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard ? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them ?
NIVUK	Romans	10	15	And how can anyone preach unless they are sent ? As it is written : ‘ How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news ! ’ [ g ]
NIVUK	Romans	10	16	But not all the Israelites accepted the good news . For Isaiah says , ‘ Lord , who has believed our message ? ’ [ h ]
NIVUK	Romans	10	17	Consequently , faith comes from hearing the message , and the message is heard through the word about Christ .
NIVUK	Romans	10	18	But I ask : did they not hear ? Of course they did : ‘ Their voice has gone out into all the earth , their words to the ends of the world. ’ [ i ]
NIVUK	Romans	10	19	Again I ask : did Israel not understand ? First , Moses says , ‘ I will make you envious by those who are not a nation ; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding. ’ [ j ]
NIVUK	Romans	10	20	And Isaiah boldly says , ‘ I was found by those who did not seek me ; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me. ’ [ k ]
NIVUK	Romans	10	21	But concerning Israel he says , ‘ All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people. ’ [ l ] Footnotes - Romans 10:5 Lev . 18:5 - Romans 10:6 Deut . 30:12 - Romans 10:7 Deut . 30:13 - Romans 10:8 Deut . 30:14 - Romans 10:11 Isaiah 28:16 ( see Septuagint ) - Romans 10:13 Joel 2:32 - Romans 10:15 Isaiah 52:7 - Romans 10:16 Isaiah 53:1 - Romans 10:18 Psalm 19:4 - Romans 10:19 Deut . 32:21 - Romans 10:20 Isaiah 65:1 - Romans 10:21 Isaiah 65:2 Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Romans	11	11	Again I ask : did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery ? Not at all ! Rather , because of their transgression , salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious .
NIVUK	Romans	11	2	God did not reject his people , whom he foreknew . Don ’ t you know what Scripture says in the passage about Elijah – how he appealed to God against Israel :
NIVUK	Romans	11	3	‘ Lord , they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars ; I am the only one left , and they are trying to kill me ’ [ a ] ?
NIVUK	Romans	11	4	And what was God ’ s answer to him ? ‘ I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	Romans	11	5	So too , at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace .
NIVUK	Romans	11	6	And if by grace , then it can not be based on works ; if it were , grace would no longer be grace .
NIVUK	Romans	11	7	What then ? What the people of Israel sought so earnestly they did not obtain . The elect among them did , but the others were hardened ,
NIVUK	Romans	11	8	as it is written : ‘ God gave them a spirit of stupor , eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear , to this very day. ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	Romans	11	9	And David says : ‘ May their table become a snare and a trap , a stumbling-block and a retribution for them .
NIVUK	Romans	11	10	May their eyes be darkened so they can not see , and their backs be bent for ever. ’ [ d ] Ingrafted branches
NIVUK	Romans	11	12	But if their transgression means riches for the world , and their loss means riches for the Gentiles , how much greater riches will their full inclusion bring !
NIVUK	Romans	11	13	I am talking to you Gentiles . Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles , I take pride in my ministry
NIVUK	Romans	11	14	in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them .
NIVUK	Romans	11	15	For if their rejection brought reconciliation to the world , what will their acceptance be but life from the dead ?
NIVUK	Romans	11	16	If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy , then the whole batch is holy ; if the root is holy , so are the branches .
NIVUK	Romans	11	17	If some of the branches have been broken off , and you , though a wild olive shoot , have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root ,
NIVUK	Romans	11	18	do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches . If you do , consider this : you do not support the root , but the root supports you .
NIVUK	Romans	11	19	You will say then , ‘ Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in. ’
NIVUK	Romans	11	20	Granted . But they were broken off because of unbelief , and you stand by faith . Do not be arrogant , but tremble .
NIVUK	Romans	11	21	For if God did not spare the natural branches , he will not spare you either .
NIVUK	Romans	11	22	Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God : sternness to those who fell , but kindness to you , provided that you continue in his kindness . Otherwise , you also will be cut off .
NIVUK	Romans	11	23	And if they do not persist in unbelief , they will be grafted in , for God is able to graft them in again .
NIVUK	Romans	11	24	After all , if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature , and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree , how much more readily will these , the natural branches , be grafted into their own olive tree ! All Israel will be saved
NIVUK	Romans	11	25	I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery , brothers and sisters , so that you may not be conceited : Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in ,
NIVUK	Romans	11	26	and in this way [ e ] all Israel will be saved . As it is written : ‘ The deliverer will come from Zion ; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob .
NIVUK	Romans	11	27	And this is [ f ] my covenant with them when I take away their sins. ’ [ g ]
NIVUK	Romans	11	28	As far as the gospel is concerned , they are enemies for your sake ; but as far as election is concerned , they are loved on account of the patriarchs ,
NIVUK	Romans	11	29	for God ’ s gifts and his call are irrevocable .
NIVUK	Romans	11	30	Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience ,
NIVUK	Romans	11	31	so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now [ h ] receive mercy as a result of God ’ s mercy to you .
NIVUK	Romans	11	32	For God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all . Doxology
NIVUK	Romans	11	33	Oh , the depth of the riches of the wisdom and [ i ] knowledge of God ! How unsearchable his judgments , and his paths beyond tracing out !

NIVUK	Romans	12	4	For just as each of us has one body with many members , and these members do not all have the same function ,
NIVUK	Romans	12	5	so in Christ we , though many , form one body , and each member belongs to all the others .
NIVUK	Romans	12	6	We have different gifts , according to the grace given to each of us . If your gift is prophesying , then prophesy in accordance with your [ a ] faith ;
NIVUK	Romans	12	7	if it is serving , then serve ; if it is teaching , then teach ;

NIVUK	Romans	13	13	Let us behave decently , as in the daytime , not in carousing and drunkenness , not in sexual immorality and debauchery , not in dissension and jealousy .
NIVUK	Romans	13	2	Consequently , whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted , and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves .
NIVUK	Romans	13	3	For rulers hold no terror for those who do right , but for those who do wrong . Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority ? Then do what is right and you will be commended .
NIVUK	Romans	13	4	For the one in authority is God ’ s servant for your good . But if you do wrong , be afraid , for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason . They are God ’ s servants , agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer .
NIVUK	Romans	13	5	Therefore , it is necessary to submit to the authorities , not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience .
NIVUK	Romans	13	6	This is also why you pay taxes , for the authorities are God ’ s servants , who give their full time to governing .
NIVUK	Romans	13	7	Give to everyone what you owe them : if you owe taxes , pay taxes ; if revenue , then revenue ; if respect , then respect ; if honour , then honour . Love fulfils the law
NIVUK	Romans	13	8	Let no debt remain outstanding , except the continuing debt to love one another , for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law .
NIVUK	Romans	13	9	The commandments , ‘ You shall not commit adultery , ’ ‘ You shall not murder , ’ ‘ You shall not steal , ’ ‘ You shall not covet , ’ [ a ] and whatever other command there may be , are summed up in this one command : ‘ Love your neighbour as yourself. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	Romans	13	10	Love does no harm to a neighbour . Therefore love is the fulfilment of the law . The day is near
NIVUK	Romans	13	11	And do this , understanding the present time : the hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber , because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed .
NIVUK	Romans	13	12	The night is nearly over ; the day is almost here . So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armour of light .

NIVUK	Romans	14	6	Whoever regards one day as special does so to the Lord . Whoever eats meat does so to the Lord , for they give thanks to God ; and whoever abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God .
NIVUK	Romans	14	7	For none of us lives for ourselves alone , and none of us dies for ourselves alone .
NIVUK	Romans	14	8	If we live , we live for the Lord ; and if we die , we die for the Lord . So , whether we live or die , we belong to the Lord .
NIVUK	Romans	14	9	For this very reason , Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living .
NIVUK	Romans	14	10	You , then , why do you judge your brother or sister ? [ a ] Or why do you treat them with contempt ? For we will all stand before God ’ s judgment seat .
NIVUK	Romans	14	11	It is written : ‘ “ As surely as I live , ” says the Lord , “ Every knee will bow before me ; every tongue will acknowledge God. ” ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	Romans	14	12	So then , each of us will give an account of ourselves to God .
NIVUK	Romans	14	13	,
NIVUK	Romans	14	15	and
NIVUK	Romans	14	16	Therefore do not let what you know is good be spoken of as evil .
NIVUK	Romans	14	17	For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking , but of righteousness , peace and joy in the Holy Spirit ,
NIVUK	Romans	14	18	because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval .
NIVUK	Romans	14	19	Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification .
NIVUK	Romans	14	20	Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food . All food is clean , but it is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble .

NIVUK	Romans	14	22	So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God . Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves .
NIVUK	Romans	14	23	But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat , because their eating is not from faith ; and everything that does not come from faith is sin .

NIVUK	Romans	15	3	For even Christ did not please himself but , as it is written : ‘ The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	Romans	15	4	For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us , so that through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and the encouragement they provide we might have hope .
NIVUK	Romans	15	5	May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had ,
NIVUK	Romans	15	6	so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
NIVUK	Romans	15	7	Accept one another , then , just as Christ accepted you , in order to bring praise to God .
NIVUK	Romans	15	8	For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews [ b ] on behalf of God ’ s truth , so that the promises made to the patriarchs might be confirmed
NIVUK	Romans	15	9	and , moreover , that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy . As it is written : ‘ Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles ; I will sing the praises of your name. ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	Romans	15	10	Again , it says , ‘ Rejoice , you Gentiles , with his people. ’ [ d ]
NIVUK	Romans	15	11	And again , ‘ Praise the Lord , all you Gentiles ; let all the peoples extol him. ’ [ e ]
NIVUK	Romans	15	12	And again , Isaiah says , ‘ The Root of Jesse will spring up , one who will arise to rule over the nations ; in him the Gentiles will hope. ’ [ f ]
NIVUK	Romans	15	13	May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him , so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit . Paul the minister to the Gentiles
NIVUK	Romans	15	14	I myself am convinced , my brothers and sisters , that you yourselves are full of goodness , filled with knowledge and competent to instruct one another .
NIVUK	Romans	15	16	to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles . He gave me the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God , so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God , sanctified by the Holy Spirit .
NIVUK	Romans	15	17	Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God .
NIVUK	Romans	15	18	I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done –
NIVUK	Romans	15	19	by the power of signs and wonders , through the power of the Spirit of God . So from Jerusalem all the way round to Illyricum , I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ .
NIVUK	Romans	15	20	It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known , so that I would not be building on someone else ’ s foundation .
NIVUK	Romans	15	21	Rather , as it is written : ‘ Those who were not told about him will see , and those who have not heard will understand. ’ [ g ]
NIVUK	Romans	15	22	This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you . Paul ’ s plan to visit Rome
NIVUK	Romans	15	23	But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions , and since I have been longing for many years to visit you ,
NIVUK	Romans	15	24	I plan to do so when I go to Spain . I hope to see you while passing through and that you will assist me on my journey there , after I have enjoyed your company for a while .
NIVUK	Romans	15	25	Now , however , I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the Lord ’ s people there .
NIVUK	Romans	15	26	For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the Lord ’ s people in Jerusalem .
NIVUK	Romans	15	27	They were pleased to do it , and indeed they owe it to them . For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews ’ spiritual blessings , they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings .
NIVUK	Romans	15	28	So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this contribution , I will go to Spain and visit you on the way .
NIVUK	Romans	15	29	I know that when I come to you , I will come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ .
NIVUK	Romans	15	30	I urge you , brothers and sisters , by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit , to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me .
NIVUK	Romans	15	31	Pray that I may be kept safe from the unbelievers in Judea and that the contribution I take to Jerusalem may be favourably received by the Lord ’ s people there ,
NIVUK	Romans	15	32	so that I may come to you with joy , by God ’ s will , and in your company be refreshed .
NIVUK	Romans	15	33	The God of peace be with you all . Amen . Footnotes - Romans 15:3 Psalm 69:9 - Romans 15:8 Greek circumcision - Romans 15:9

NIVUK	Romans	16	17	I urge you , brothers and sisters , to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned . Keep away from them .
NIVUK	Romans	16	18	For such people are not serving our Lord Christ , but their own appetites . By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naïve people .
NIVUK	Romans	16	19	Everyone has heard about your obedience , so I rejoice because of you ; but I want you to be wise about what is good , and innocent about what is evil .
NIVUK	Romans	16	20	The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet . The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you .

NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	2	To the church of God in Corinth , to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be his holy people , together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ – their Lord and ours :
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	3	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Thanksgiving
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I always thank my God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	5	For in him you have been enriched in every way – with all kinds of speech and with all knowledge –
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	6	,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	7	Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	8	He will also keep you firm to the end , so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful , who has called you into fellowship with his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord . A church divided over leaders
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	10	I appeal to you , brothers and sisters , [ a ] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	11	and
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	12	What I mean is this : one of you says , ‘ I follow Paul ’ ; another , ‘ I follow Apollos ’ ; another , ‘ I follow Cephas [ b ] ’ ; still another , ‘ I follow Christ. ’
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	13	Is Christ divided ? Was Paul crucified for you ? Were you baptised in the name of Paul ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I thank God that I did not baptise any of you except Crispus and Gaius ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	15	so no one can say that you were baptised in my name .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	16	( Yes , I also baptised the household of Stephanas ; beyond that , I don ’ t remember if I baptised anyone else . )
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	17	For Christ did not send me to baptise , but to preach the gospel – not with wisdom and eloquence , lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power . Christ crucified is God ’ s power and wisdom
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	18	For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing , but to us who are being saved it is the power of God .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	19	For it is written : ‘ I will destroy the wisdom of the wise ; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate. ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	20	. -
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	21	For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him , God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	22	Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	23	but we preach Christ crucified : a stumbling-block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	24	but to those whom God has called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	25	For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom , and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	26	,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	27	But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise ; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	28	God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things – and the things that are not – to nullify the things that are ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	29	; 10:1 ; 11:33 ; 12:1 ; 14:6 ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	30	It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus , who has become for us wisdom from God – that is , our righteousness , holiness and redemption .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	1	31	Therefore , as it is written : ‘ Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord. ’ [ d ] Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	2	2	For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	2	3	I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	2	4	My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words , but with a demonstration of the Spirit ’ s power ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	2	5	so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom , but on God ’ s power . God ’ s wisdom revealed by the Spirit
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	2	6	We do , however , speak a message of wisdom among the mature , but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age , who are coming to nothing .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	2	7	No , we declare God ’ s wisdom , a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	2	8	None of the rulers of this age understood it , for if they had , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	2	9	However , as it is written : ‘ What no eye has seen , what no ear has heard , and what no human mind has conceived ’ [ b ] – the things God has prepared for those who love him –
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	2	10	these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit . The Spirit searches all things , even the deep things of God .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	2	11	For who knows a person ’ s thoughts except their own spirit within them ? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	2	12	What we have received is not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit who is from God , so that we may understand what God has freely given us .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	2	13	This is what we speak , not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit , explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words . [ c ]
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	2	14	The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness , and can not understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	2	15	The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things , but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	2	16	for , ‘ Who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him ? ’ [ d ] But we have the mind of Christ . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	3	You are still worldly . For since there is jealousy and quarrelling among you , are you not worldly ? Are you not acting like mere humans ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	2	I gave you milk , not solid food , for you were not yet ready for it . Indeed , you are still not ready .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	4	For when one says , ‘ I follow Paul , ’ and another , ‘ I follow Apollos , ’ are you not mere human beings ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	5	What , after all , is Apollos ? And what is Paul ? Only servants , through whom you came to believe – as the Lord has assigned to each his task .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	6	I planted the seed , Apollos watered it , but God has been making it grow .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything , but only God , who makes things grow .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	8	The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose , and they will each be rewarded according to their own labour .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	9	For we are fellow workers in God ’ s service ; you are God ’ s field , God ’ s building .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	10	By the grace God has given me , I laid a foundation as a wise builder , and someone else is building on it . But each one should build with care .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	11	For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid , which is Jesus Christ .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	12	If anyone builds on this foundation using gold , silver , costly stones , wood , hay or straw ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	13	their work will be shown for what it is , because the Day will bring it to light . It will be revealed with fire , and the fire will test the quality of each person ’ s work .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If what has been built survives , the builder will receive a reward .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	15	If it is burned up , the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved – even though only as one escaping through the flames .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	16	Don ’ t you know that you yourselves are God ’ s temple and that God ’ s Spirit lives among you ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If anyone destroys God ’ s temple , God will destroy that person ; for God ’ s temple is sacred , and you together are that temple .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Do not deceive yourselves . If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age , you should become ‘ fools ’ so that you may become wise .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God ’ s sight . As it is written : ‘ He catches the wise in their craftiness ’ [ a ] ;
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	20	and again , ‘ The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	21	So then , no more boasting about human leaders ! All things are yours ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	22	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas [ c ] or the world or life or death or the present or the future – all are yours ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	3	23	and you are of Christ , and Christ is of God . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	1	Corinthians
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	4	My conscience is clear , but that does not make me innocent . It is the Lord who judges me .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	2	Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	3	I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court ; indeed , I do not even judge myself .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	5	Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time ; wait until the Lord comes . He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of the heart . At that time each will receive their praise from God .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	6	Now , brothers and sisters , I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit , so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying , ‘ Do not go beyond what is written. ’ Then you will not be puffed up in being a follower of one of us over against the other .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	7	For who makes you different from anyone else ? What do you have that you did not receive ? And if you did receive it , why do you boast as though you did not ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	8	Already you have all you want ! Already you have become rich ! You have begun to reign – and that without us ! How I wish that you really had begun to reign so that we also might reign with you !
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	9	For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession , like those condemned to die in the arena . We have been made a spectacle to the whole universe , to angels as well as to human beings .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ , but you are so wise in Christ ! We are weak , but you are strong ! You are honoured , we are dishonoured !
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	11	To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty , we are in rags , we are brutally treated , we are homeless .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	12	We work hard with our own hands . When we are cursed , we bless ; when we are persecuted , we endure it ;
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	13	when we are slandered , we answer kindly . We have become the scum of the earth , the garbage of the world – right up to this moment . Paul ’ s appeal and warning
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I am writing this not to shame you but to warn you as my dear children .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	15	Even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ , you do not have many fathers , for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	16	Therefore I urge you to imitate me .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	17	For this reason I have sent to you Timothy , my son whom I love , who is faithful in the Lord . He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus , which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	18	Some of you have become arrogant , as if I were not coming to you .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you very soon , if the Lord is willing , and then I will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking , but what power they have .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	4	20	For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power .

NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	5	2	And you are proud ! Shouldn ’ t you rather have gone into mourning and have put out of your fellowship the man who has been doing this ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	5	3	For my part , even though I am not physically present , I am with you in spirit . As one who is present with you in this way , I have already passed judgment in the name of our Lord Jesus on the one who has been doing this .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	5	4	So when you are assembled and I am with you in spirit , and the power of our Lord Jesus is present ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	5	6	Your boasting is not good . Don ’ t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough ?

NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	5	8	Therefore let us keep the Festival , not with the old bread leavened with malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	5	9	I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people –
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	5	10	not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral , or the greedy and swindlers , or idolaters . In that case you would have to leave this world .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	5	11	But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister [ c ] but is sexually immoral or greedy , an idolater or slanderer , a drunkard or swindler . Do not even eat with such people .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	5	12	What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church ? Are you not to judge those inside ?

NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	6	But instead , one brother takes another to court – and this in front of unbelievers !
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	2	Or do you not know that the Lord ’ s people will judge the world ? And if you are to judge the world , are you not competent to judge trivial cases ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	3	Do you not know that we will judge angels ? How much more the things of this life !
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	4	Therefore , if you have disputes about such matters , do you ask for a ruling from those whose way of life is scorned in the church ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	5	I say this to shame you . Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	7	The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already . Why not rather be wronged ? Why not rather be cheated ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	8	Instead , you yourselves cheat and do wrong , and you do this to your brothers and sisters .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	9	Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God ? Do not be deceived : neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men [ a ]
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	10	nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	11	And that is what some of you were . But you were washed , you were sanctified , you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God . Sexual immorality
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	12	‘ I have the right to do anything , ’ you say – but not everything is beneficial . ‘ I have the right to do anything ’ – but I will not be mastered by anything .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	13	You say , ‘ Food for the stomach and the stomach for food , and God will destroy them both. ’ The body , however , is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord , and the Lord for the body .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	14	By his power God raised the Lord from the dead , and he will raise us also .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	15	Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute ? Never !
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	16	Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body ? For it is said , ‘ The two will become one flesh. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	17	But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit . [ c ]
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	18	Flee from sexual immorality . All other sins a person commits are outside the body , but whoever sins sexually , sins against their own body .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	19	Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit , who is in you , whom you have received from God ? You are not your own ;
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	6	20	you were bought at a price . Therefore honour God with your bodies . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	1	Corinthians 7:38 Or
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	7	I wish that all of you were as I am . But each of you has your own gift from God ; one has this gift , another has that .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	2	But since sexual immorality is occurring , each man should have sexual relations with his own wife , and each woman with her own husband .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	3	The husband should fulfil his marital duty to his wife , and likewise the wife to her husband .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	4	The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband . In the same way , the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	5	Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time , so that you may devote yourselves to prayer . Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	6	I say this as a concession , not as a command .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	8	Now to the unmarried [ a ] and the widows I say : it is good for them to stay unmarried , as I do .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if they can not control themselves , they should marry , for it is better to marry than to burn with passion .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	10	To the married I give this command ( not I , but the Lord ) : a wife must not separate from her husband .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	11	But if she does , she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband . And a husband must not divorce his wife .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	12	To the rest I say this ( I , not the Lord ) : If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him , he must not divorce her .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	13	And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her , she must not divorce him .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife , and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband . Otherwise your children would be unclean , but as it is , they are holy .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	15	But if the unbeliever leaves , let it be so . The brother or the sister is not bound in such circumstances ; God has called us to live in peace .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	16	How do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? Or , how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ? Concerning change of status
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	17	Nevertheless , each person should live as a believer in whatever situation the Lord has assigned to them , just as God has called them . This is the rule I lay down in all the churches .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	18	Was a man already circumcised when he was called ? He should not become uncircumcised . Was a man uncircumcised when he was called ? He should not be circumcised .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing . Keeping God ’ s commands is what counts .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Each person should remain in the situation they were in when God called them .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Were you a slave when you were called ? Don ’ t let it trouble you – although if you can gain your freedom , do so .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	22	For the one who was a slave when called to faith in the Lord is the Lord ’ s freed person ; similarly , the one who was free when called is Christ ’ s slave .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	23	You were bought at a price ; do not become slaves of human beings .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	24	Brothers and sisters , each person , as responsible to God , should remain in the situation they were in when God called them . Concerning the unmarried
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now about virgins : I have no command from the Lord , but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord ’ s mercy is trustworthy .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	26	Because of the present crisis , I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Are you pledged to a woman ? Do not seek to be released . Are you free from such a commitment ? Do not look for a wife .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But if you do marry , you have not sinned ; and if a virgin marries , she has not sinned . But those who marry will face many troubles in this life , and I want to spare you this .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	29	What I mean , brothers and sisters , is that the time is short . From now on those who have wives should live as if they do not ;
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	30	those who mourn , as if they did not ; those who are happy , as if they were not ; those who buy something , as if it were not theirs to keep ;
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	31	those who use the things of the world , as if not engrossed in them . For this world in its present form is passing away .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	32	I would like you to be free from concern . An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord ’ s affairs – how he can please the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	33	But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world – how he can please his wife –
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	34	and his interests are divided . An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord ’ s affairs : her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit . But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world – how she can please her husband .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	35	I am saying this for your own good , not to restrict you , but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	36	If anyone thinks he is not treating his daughter properly , and if she is getting along in years ( or if her passions are too strong ) , and he feels she ought to marry , he should do as he wants . He is not sinning . He should let her get married .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	37	But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind , who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will , and who has made up his mind to keep the virgin unmarried – this man also does the right thing .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	38	So then , he who gives his virgin in marriage does right , but he who does not give her in marriage does better . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	39	A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives . But if her husband dies , she is free to marry anyone she wishes , but he must belong to the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	7	40	In my judgment , she is happier if she stays as she is – and I think that I too have the Spirit of God . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	8	1	Corinthians 8:3 An early manuscript and another ancient witness think they have knowledge do not yet know as they ought to know .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	8	8	But food does not bring us near to God ; we are no worse if we do not eat , and no better if we do .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	8	2	Those who think they know something do not yet know as they ought to know .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	8	3	But whoever loves truly knows . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	8	4	So then , about eating food sacrificed to idols : we know that ‘ An idol is nothing at all in the world ’ and that ‘ There is no God but one. ’
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	8	5	For even if there are so-called gods , whether in heaven or on earth ( as indeed there are many ‘ gods ’ and many ‘ lords ’ ) ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	8	6	yet for us there is but one God , the Father , from whom all things came and for whom we live ; and there is but one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom all things came and through whom we live .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	8	7	But not everyone possesses this knowledge . Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat sacrificial food they think of it as having been sacrificed to a god , and since their conscience is weak , it is defiled .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	8	9	Be careful , however , that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling-block to the weak .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	8	10	For if someone with a weak conscience sees you , with all your knowledge , eating in an idol ’ s temple , won ’ t that person be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to idols ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	8	11	So this weak brother or sister , for whom Christ died , is destroyed by your knowledge .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	8	12	When you sin against them in this way and wound their weak conscience , you sin against Christ .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	8	13	Therefore , if what I eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin , I will never eat meat again , so that I will not cause them to fall . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	9	For it is written in the Law of Moses : ‘ Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain. ’ [ b ] Is it about oxen that God is concerned ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	2	Even though I may not be an apostle to others , surely I am to you ! For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	3	This is my defence to those who sit in judgment on me .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	4	Don ’ t we have the right to food and drink ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	5	Don ’ t we have the right to take a believing wife along with us , as do the other apostles and the Lord ’ s brothers and Cephas [ a ] ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Or is it only I and Barnabas who lack the right to not work for a living ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	7	Who serves as a soldier at his own expense ? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its grapes ? Who tends a flock and does not drink the milk ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	8	Do I say this merely on human authority ? Doesn ’ t the Law say the same thing ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	10	Surely he says this for us , doesn ’ t he ? Yes , this was written for us , because whoever ploughs and threshes should be able to do so in the hope of sharing in the harvest .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	11	If we have sown spiritual seed among you , is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others have this right of support from you , shouldn ’ t we have it all the more ? But we did not use this right . On the contrary , we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	13	Don ’ t you know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple , and that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	14	In the same way , the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But I have not used any of these rights . And I am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me , for I would rather die than allow anyone to deprive me of this boast .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	16	For when I preach the gospel , I can not boast , since I am compelled to preach . Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel !
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	17	If I preach voluntarily , I have a reward ; if not voluntarily , I am simply discharging the trust committed to me .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	18	What then is my reward ? Just this : that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge , and so not make full use of my rights as a preacher of the gospel . Paul ’ s use of his freedom
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	19	Though I am free and belong to no one , I have made myself a slave to everyone , to win as many as possible .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	20	To the Jews I became like a Jew , to win the Jews . To those under the law I became like one under the law ( though I myself am not under the law ) , so as to win those under the law .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	21	To those not having the law I became like one not having the law ( though I am not free from God ’ s law but am under Christ ’ s law ) , so as to win those not having the law .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	22	To the weak I became weak , to win the weak . I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	23	I do all this for the sake of the gospel , that I may share in its blessings . The need for self-discipline
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	24	Do you not know that in a race all the runners run , but only one gets the prize ? Run in such a way as to get the prize .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	25	Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training . They do it to get a crown that will not last ; but we do it to get a crown that will last for ever .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	26	Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly ; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	9	27	No , I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others , I myself will not be disqualified for the prize . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	10	And do not grumble , as some of them did – and were killed by the destroying angel .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	2	They were all baptised into Moses in the cloud and in the sea .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	3	They all ate the same spiritual food
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	4	and drank the same spiritual drink ; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them , and that rock was Christ .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	5	Nevertheless , God was not pleased with most of them ; their bodies were scattered in the wilderness .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	6	Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	7	Do not be idolaters , as some of them were ; as it is written : ‘ The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	8	We should not commit sexual immorality , as some of them did – and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	9	We should not test Christ , [ b ] as some of them did – and were killed by snakes .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	11	These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us , on whom the culmination of the ages has come .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	12	So , if you think you are standing firm , be careful that you don ’ t fall !
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	13	No temptation [ c ] has overtaken you except what is common to mankind . And God is faithful ; he will not let you be tempted [ d ] beyond what you can bear . But when you are tempted , [ e ] he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it . Idol feasts and the Lord ’ s Supper
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	14	Therefore , my dear friends , flee from idolatry .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	15	I speak to sensible people ; judge for yourselves what I say .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	16	Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	17	Because there is one loaf , we , who are many , are one body , for we all share the one loaf .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	18	Consider the people of Israel : do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	19	Do I mean then that food sacrificed to an idol is anything , or that an idol is anything ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	20	No , but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons , not to God , and I do not want you to be participants with demons .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	21	You can not drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too ; you can not have a part in both the Lord ’ s table and the table of demons .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	22	Are we trying to arouse the Lord ’ s jealousy ? Are we stronger than he ? The believer ’ s freedom
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	23	‘ I have the right to do anything , ’ you say – but not everything is beneficial . ‘ I have the right to do anything ’ – but not everything is constructive .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	24	No one should seek their own good , but the good of others .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	25	Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	26	for , ‘ The earth is the Lord ’ s , and everything in it. ’ [ f ]
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	27	If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go , eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	28	But if someone says to you , ‘ This has been offered in sacrifice , ’ then do not eat it , both for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	29	I am referring to the other person ’ s conscience , not yours . For why is my freedom being judged by another ’ s conscience ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	30	If I take part in the meal with thankfulness , why am I denounced because of something I thank God for ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	31	So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do , do it all for the glory of God .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	32	Do not cause anyone to stumble , whether Jews , Greeks or the church of God –
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	10	33	even as I try to please everyone in every way . For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many , so that they may be saved . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	11	Nevertheless , in the Lord woman is not independent of man , nor is man independent of woman .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	2	I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the traditions just as I passed them on to you .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	3	But I want you to realise that the head of every man is Christ , and the head of the woman is man , [ a ] and the head of Christ is God .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	4	Every man who prays or prophesies with long hair dishonours his head .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	5	But every woman who prays or prophesies with no covering of hair dishonours her head – she is just like one of the ‘ shorn women ’ .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	6	If a woman has no covering , let her be for now with short hair ; but since it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair shorn or shaved , she should grow it again .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	7	A man ought not to have long hair -
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	8	For man did not come from woman , but woman from man ;
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	9	neither was man created for woman , but woman for man .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	10	It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own [ c ] head , because of the angels .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	12	For as woman came from man , so also man is born of woman . But everything comes from God .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	13	Judge for yourselves : is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	14	Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair , it is a disgrace to him ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	15	but that if a woman has long hair , it is her glory ? For long hair is given to her as a covering .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	16	If anyone wants to be contentious about this , we have no other practice – nor do the churches of God . Correcting an abuse of the Lord ’ s Supper
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	17	In the following directives I have no praise for you , for your meetings do more harm than good .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	18	In the first place , I hear that when you come together as a church , there are divisions among you , and to some extent I believe it .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	19	No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God ’ s approval .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	20	So then , when you come together , it is not the Lord ’ s Supper you eat ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	21	for when you are eating , some of you go ahead with your own private suppers . As a result , one person remains hungry and another gets drunk .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	22	Don ’ t you have homes to eat and drink in ? Or do you despise the church of God by humiliating those who have nothing ? What shall I say to you ? Shall I praise you ? Certainly not in this matter !
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	23	For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you : the Lord Jesus , on the night he was betrayed , took bread ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	24	and when he had given thanks , he broke it and said , ‘ This is my body , which is for you ; do this in remembrance of me. ’
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	25	In the same way , after supper he took the cup , saying , ‘ This cup is the new covenant in my blood ; do this , whenever you drink it , in remembrance of me. ’
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	26	For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup , you proclaim the Lord ’ s death until he comes .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	27	So then , whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	28	Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	29	For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	30	That is why many among you are weak and ill , and a number of you have fallen asleep .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	31	But if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves , we would not come under such judgment .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	32	Nevertheless , when we are judged in this way by the Lord , we are being disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	33	So then , my brothers and sisters , when you gather to eat , you should all eat together .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	11	34	Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home , so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment . And when I come I will give further instructions . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	12	Just as a body , though one , has many parts , but all its many parts form one body , so it is with Christ .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	2	You know that when you were pagans , somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to dumb idols .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	3	Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says , ‘ Jesus be cursed , ’ and no one can say , ‘ Jesus is Lord , ’ except by the Holy Spirit .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	4	There are different kinds of gifts , but the same Spirit distributes them .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	5	There are different kinds of service , but the same Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	6	There are different kinds of working , but in all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	7	Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	8	To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom , to another a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	9	to another faith by the same Spirit , to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	10	to another miraculous powers , to another prophecy , to another distinguishing between spirits , to another speaking in different kinds of tongues , [ a ] and to still another the interpretation of tongues . [ b ]
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	11	All these are the work of one and the same Spirit , and he distributes them to each one , just as he determines . Unity and diversity in the body
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	13	For we were all baptised by [ c ] one Spirit so as to form one body – whether Jews or Gentiles , slave or free – and we were all given the one Spirit to drink .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	14	And so the body is not made up of one part but of many .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	15	Now if the foot should say , ‘ Because I am not a hand , I do not belong to the body , ’ it would not for that reason stop being part of the body .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear should say , ‘ Because I am not an eye , I do not belong to the body , ’ it would not for that reason stop being part of the body .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye , where would the sense of hearing be ? If the whole body were an ear , where would the sense of smell be ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But in fact God has placed the parts in the body , every one of them , just as he wanted them to be .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	19	If they were all one part , where would the body be ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	20	As it is , there are many parts , but one body .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	21	The eye can not say to the hand , ‘ I don ’ t need you ! ’ And the head can not say to the feet , ‘ I don ’ t need you ! ’
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	22	On the contrary , those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	23	and the parts that we think are less honourable we treat with special honour . And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	24	while our presentable parts need no special treatment . But God has put the body together , giving greater honour to the parts that lacked it ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	25	so that there should be no division in the body , but that its parts should have equal concern for each other .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	26	If one part suffers , every part suffers with it ; if one part is honoured , every part rejoices with it .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	27	Now you are the body of Christ , and each one of you is a part of it .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	28	-
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	29	Are all apostles ? Are all prophets ? Are all teachers ? Do all work miracles ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	30	Do all have gifts of healing ? Do all speak in tongues [ d ] ? Do all interpret ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	12	31	Now eagerly desire the greater gifts . Love is indispensable And yet I will show you the most excellent way . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	13	13	And now these three remain : faith , hope and love . But the greatest of these is love . Footnotes -
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	13	2	If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge , and if I have a faith that can move mountains , but do not have love , I am nothing .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	13	3	If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast , [ b ] but do not have love , I gain nothing .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	13	4	Love is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	13	5	It does not dishonour others , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	13	6	Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	13	7	It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	13	8	Love never fails . But where there are prophecies , they will cease ; where there are tongues , they will be stilled ; where there is knowledge , it will pass away .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	13	9	For we know in part and we prophesy in part ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	13	10	but when completeness comes , what is in part disappears .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I talked like a child , I thought like a child , I reasoned like a child . When I became a man , I put the ways of childhood behind me .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	13	12	For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror ; then we shall see face to face . Now I know in part ; then I shall know fully , even as I am fully known .

NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	1	Corinthians 14:38 Some manuscripts But anyone who is ignorant of this will be ignorant Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	14	,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	2	For anyone who speaks in a tongue [ a ] does not speak to people but to God . Indeed , no one understands them ; they utter mysteries by the Spirit .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening , encouraging and comfort .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	4	,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	5	I would like every one of you to speak in tongues , [ b ] but even more to prophesy . The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues , [ c ] unless someone interprets , so that the church may be edified .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	6	,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	7	Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds , such as the pipe or harp , how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	8	Again , if the trumpet does not sound a clear call , who will get ready for battle ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	9	So it is with you . Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue , how will anyone know what you are saying ? You will just be speaking into the air .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	10	Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world , yet none of them is without meaning .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	11	If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying , I am a foreigner to the speaker , and the speaker is a foreigner to me .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	12	So it is with you . Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit , try to excel in those that build up the church .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	13	,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	15	So what shall I do ? I will pray with my spirit , but I will also pray with my understanding ; I will sing with my spirit , but I will also sing with my understanding .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	16	Otherwise when you are praising God in the Spirit , how can someone else , who is now put in the position of an enquirer , [ d ] say ‘ Amen ’ to your thanksgiving , since they do not know what you are saying ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	17	You are giving thanks well enough , but no one else is edified .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	18	,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	19	,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	20	Brothers and sisters , stop thinking like children . In regard to evil be infants , but in your thinking be adults .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	21	In the Law it is written : ‘ With other tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people , but even then they will not listen to me , says the Lord. ’ [ e ]

NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	24	. -
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	25	as the secrets of their hearts are laid bare . So they will fall down and worship God , exclaiming , ‘ God is really among you ! ’ Good order in worship
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	26	and
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	27	-
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	28	If there is no interpreter , the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and to God .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	29	Two or three prophets should speak , and the others should weigh carefully what is said .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	30	And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down , the first speaker should stop .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	31	For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	32	The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	33	For God is not a God of disorder but of peace – as in all the congregations of the Lord ’ s people .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	34	women -
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	35	If they want to enquire about something , they should ask their own husbands at home ; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church . [ g ]
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	36	Or did the word of God originate with you ? Or are you the only people it has reached ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	37	If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit , let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord ’ s command .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	14	38	But if anyone ignores this , they will themselves be ignored . [ h ]

NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	15	More than that , we are then found to be false witnesses about God , for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead . But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	2	By this gospel you are saved , if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you . Otherwise , you have believed in vain .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	3	For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance [ a ] : that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	4	that he was buried , that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	5	and that he appeared to Cephas , [ b ] and then to the Twelve .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	6	After that , he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time , most of whom are still living , though some have fallen asleep .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	7	Then he appeared to James , then to all the apostles ,
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	8	and last of all he appeared to me also , as to one abnormally born .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God I am what I am , and his grace to me was not without effect . No , I worked harder than all of them – yet not I , but the grace of God that was with me .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	11	Whether , then , it is I or they , this is what we preach , and this is what you believed . The resurrection of the dead
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	12	But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead , how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	13	If there is no resurrection of the dead , then not even Christ has been raised .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ has not been raised , our preaching is useless and so is your faith .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead are not raised , then Christ has not been raised either .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	17	And if Christ has not been raised , your faith is futile ; you are still in your sins .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	18	Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If only for this life we have hope in Christ , we are of all people most to be pitied .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead , the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	21	For since death came through a man , the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	22	For as in Adam all die , so in Christ all will be made alive .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	23	But each in turn : Christ , the firstfruits ; then , when he comes , those who belong to him .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	24	Then the end will come , when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion , authority and power .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	25	For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy to be destroyed is death .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	27	For he ‘ has put everything under his feet ’ . [ c ] Now when it says that ‘ everything ’ has been put under him , it is clear that this does not include God himself , who put everything under Christ .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	28	When he has done this , then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him , so that God may be all in all .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Now if there is no resurrection , what will those do who are baptised for the dead ? If the dead are not raised at all , why are people baptised for them ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	30	And as for us , why do we endanger ourselves every hour ?
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	31	I face death every day – yes , just as surely as I boast about you in Christ Jesus our Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	32	If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with no more than human hopes , what have I gained ? If the dead are not raised , ‘ Let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die. ’ [ d ]
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Do not be misled : ‘ Bad company corrupts good character. ’ [ e ]
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	34	Come back to your senses as you ought , and stop sinning ; for there are some who are ignorant of God – I say this to your shame . The resurrection body
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But someone will ask , ‘ How are the dead raised ? With what kind of body will they come ? ’
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	36	How foolish ! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	37	When you sow , you do not plant the body that will be , but just a seed , perhaps of wheat or of something else .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	38	But God gives it a body as he has determined , and to each kind of seed he gives its own body .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	39	Not all flesh is the same : people have one kind of flesh , animals have another , birds another and fish another .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	40	There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies ; but the splendour of the heavenly bodies is one kind , and the splendour of the earthly bodies is another .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	41	The sun has one kind of splendour , the moon another and the stars another ; and star differs from star in splendour .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	42	So will it be with the resurrection of the dead . The body that is sown is perishable , it is raised imperishable ;
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	43	it is sown in dishonour , it is raised in glory ; it is sown in weakness , it is raised in power ;
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	44	it is sown a natural body , it is raised a spiritual body . If there is a natural body , there is also a spiritual body .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	45	So it is written : ‘ The first man Adam became a living being ’ [ f ] ; the last Adam , a life-giving spirit .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	46	The spiritual did not come first , but the natural , and after that the spiritual .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man was of the dust of the earth ; the second man is of heaven .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	48	As was the earthly man , so are those who are of the earth ; and as is the heavenly man , so also are those who are of heaven .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	49	And just as we have borne the image of the earthly man , so shall we [ g ] bear the image of the heavenly man .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	50	I declare to you , brothers and sisters , that flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God , nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	51	Listen , I tell you a mystery : we will not all sleep , but we will all be changed –
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	52	in a flash , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet . For the trumpet will sound , the dead will be raised imperishable , and we will be changed .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	53	For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable , and the mortal with immortality .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	54	When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable , and the mortal with immortality , then the saying that is written will come true : ‘ Death has been swallowed up in victory. ’ [ h ]
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	55	‘ Where , O death , is your victory ? Where , O death , is your sting ? ’ [ i ]
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	56	The sting of death is sin , and the power of sin is the law .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God ! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
NIVUK	1%20Corinthians	15	58	Therefore , my dear brothers and sisters , stand firm . Let nothing move you . Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord , because you know that your labour in the Lord is not in vain . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and Timothy our brother , To the church of God in Corinth , together with all his holy people throughout Achaia :
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	3	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort ,
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	4	who comforts us in all our troubles , so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	5	For just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ , so also our comfort abounds through Christ .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	6	If we are distressed , it is for your comfort and salvation ; if we are comforted , it is for your comfort , which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	7	And our hope for you is firm , because we know that just as you share in our sufferings , so also you share in our comfort .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	8	We do not want you to be uninformed , brothers and sisters , [ a ] about the troubles we experienced in the province of Asia . We were under great pressure , far beyond our ability to endure , so that we despaired of life itself .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	9	Indeed , we felt we had received the sentence of death . But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God , who raises the dead .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	10	He has delivered us from such a deadly peril , and he will deliver us again . On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us ,
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	11	as you help us by your prayers . Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favour granted us in answer to the prayers of many . Paul ’ s change of plans
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	12	Now this is our boast : our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world , and especially in our relations with you , with integrity [ b ] and godly sincerity . We have done so , relying not on worldly wisdom but on God ’ s grace .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	13	For we do not write to you anything you can not read or understand . And I hope that ,
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	14	as you have understood us in part , you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	15	Because I was confident of this , I wanted to visit you first so that you might benefit twice .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	16	I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia , and then to let you send me on my way to Judea .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	17	Was I fickle when I intended to do this ? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say both ‘ Yes , yes ’ and ‘ No , no ’ ?
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	18	But as surely as God is faithful , our message to you is not ‘ Yes ’ and ‘ No ’ .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God , Jesus Christ , who was preached among you by us – by me , Silas [ c ] and Timothy – was not ‘ Yes ’ and ‘ No ’ , but in him it has always been ‘ Yes ’ .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	20	For no matter how many promises God has made , they are ‘ Yes ’ in Christ . And so through him the ‘ Amen ’ is spoken by us to the glory of God .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	21	Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ . He anointed us ,
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	22	set his seal of ownership on us , and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit , guaranteeing what is to come .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	23	I call God as my witness – and I stake my life on it – that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	1	24	Not that we lord it over your faith , but we work with you for your joy , because it is by faith you stand firm . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	2	2	For if I grieve you , who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved ?
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	2	1	So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	2	3	I wrote as I did , so that when I came I would not be distressed by those who should have made me rejoice . I had confidence in all of you , that you would all share my joy .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	2	4	For I wrote to you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears , not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you . Forgiveness for the offender
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	2	5	If anyone has caused grief , he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you to some extent – not to put it too severely .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	2	6	The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	2	7	Now instead , you ought to forgive and comfort him , so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	2	8	I urge you , therefore , to reaffirm your love for him .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	2	9	Another reason I wrote to you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	2	10	Anyone you forgive , I also forgive . And what I have forgiven – if there was anything to forgive – I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake ,
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	2	11	in order that Satan might not outwit us . For we are not unaware of his schemes . Ministers of the new covenant
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	2	12	Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me ,
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	2	13	I still had no peace of mind , because I did not find my brother Titus there . So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	2	14	But thanks be to God , who always leads us as captives in Christ ’ s triumphal procession and uses us to spread the aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	2	15	For we are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	2	16	To the one we are an aroma that brings death ; to the other , an aroma that brings life . And who is equal to such a task ?
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	2	17	Unlike so many , we do not peddle the word of God for profit . On the contrary , in Christ we speak before God with sincerity , as those sent from God . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	3	3	You show that you are a letter from Christ , the result of our ministry , written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God , not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	3	4	Such confidence we have through Christ before God .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	3	5	Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves , but our competence comes from God .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	3	6	He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant – not of the letter but of the Spirit ; for the letter kills , but the Spirit gives life . The greater glory of the new covenant
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	3	7	Now if the ministry that brought death , which was engraved in letters on stone , came with glory , so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory , transitory though it was ,
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	3	8	will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious ?
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	3	9	If the ministry that brought condemnation was glorious , how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness !
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	3	10	For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	3	11	And if what was transitory came with glory , how much greater is the glory of that which lasts !
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	3	12	Therefore , since we have such a hope , we are very bold .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	3	13	We are not like Moses , who would put a veil over his face to prevent the Israelites from seeing the end of what was passing away .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were made dull , for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read . It has not been removed , because only in Christ is it taken away .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	3	15	Even to this day when Moses is read , a veil covers their hearts .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	3	16	But whenever anyone turns to the Lord , the veil is taken away .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is the Spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is freedom .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	3	18	And we all , who with unveiled faces contemplate [ a ] the Lord ’ s glory , are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory , which comes from the Lord , who is the Spirit . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	4	4	The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers , so that they can not see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ , who is the image of God .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	4	3	And even if our gospel is veiled , it is veiled to those who are perishing .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	4	5	For what we preach is not ourselves , but Jesus Christ as Lord , and ourselves as your servants for Jesus ’ sake .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	4	6	For God , who said , ‘ Let light shine out of darkness , ’ [ a ] made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God ’ s glory displayed in the face of Christ .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	4	8	We are hard pressed on every side , but not crushed ; perplexed , but not in despair ;
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	4	9	persecuted , but not abandoned ; struck down , but not destroyed .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	4	10	We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus , so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	4	11	For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus ’ sake , so that his life may also be revealed in our mortal body .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	4	12	So then , death is at work in us , but life is at work in you .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	4	13	It is written : ‘ I believed ; therefore I have spoken. ’ [ b ] Since we have that same spirit of [ c ] faith , we also believe and therefore speak ,
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	4	14	because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you to himself .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	4	15	All this is for your benefit , so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	4	16	Therefore we do not lose heart . Though outwardly we are wasting away , yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	4	17	For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	4	18	So we fix our eyes not on what is seen , but on what is unseen , since what is seen is temporary , but what is unseen is eternal . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	5	Now the one who has fashioned us for this very purpose is God , who has given us the Spirit as a deposit , guaranteeing what is to come .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	3	because when we are clothed , we will not be found naked .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	4	For while we are in this tent , we groan and are burdened , because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling , so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	6	Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	7	For we live by faith , not by sight .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	8	We are confident , I say , and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	9	So we make it our goal to please him , whether we are at home in the body or away from it .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ , so that each of us may receive what is due to us for the things done while in the body , whether good or bad . The ministry of reconciliation
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	11	Since , then , we know what it is to fear the Lord , we try to persuade others . What we are is plain to God , and I hope it is also plain to your conscience .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	12	We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again , but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us , so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	13	If we are ‘ out of our mind , ’ as some say , it is for God ; if we are in our right mind , it is for you .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	14	For Christ ’ s love compels us , because we are convinced that one died for all , and therefore all died .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	15	And he died for all , that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	16	So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view . Though we once regarded Christ in this way , we do so no longer .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	17	Therefore , if anyone is in Christ , the new creation has come : [ a ] the old has gone , the new is here !
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	18	All this is from God , who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation :
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	19	that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ , not counting people ’ s sins against them . And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	20	We are therefore Christ ’ s ambassadors , as though God were making his appeal through us . We implore you on Christ ’ s behalf : be reconciled to God .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	5	21	God made him who had no sin to be sin [ b ] for us , so that in him we might become the righteousness of God . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	6	13	As a fair exchange – I speak as to my children – open wide your hearts also . Warning against idolatry
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	6	14	Do not be yoked together with unbelievers . For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common ? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness ?
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	6	15	What harmony is there between Christ and Belial [ b ] ? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever ?
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	6	16	What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols ? For we are the temple of the living God . As God has said : ‘ I will live with them and walk among them , and I will be their God , and they will be my people. ’ [ c ]

NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	7	2	Make room for us in your hearts . We have wronged no one , we have corrupted no one , we have exploited no one .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	7	7	and not only by his coming but also by the comfort you had given him . He told us about your longing for me , your deep sorrow , your ardent concern for me , so that my joy was greater than ever .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I do not say this to condemn you ; I have said before that you have such a place in our hearts that we would live or die with you .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	7	4	I have spoken to you with great frankness ; I take great pride in you . I am greatly encouraged ; in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	7	5	For when we came into Macedonia , we had no rest , but we were harassed at every turn – conflicts on the outside , fears within .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	7	6	But God , who comforts the downcast , comforted us by the coming of Titus ,
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	7	8	Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter , I do not regret it . Though I did regret it – I see that my letter hurt you , but only for a little while –
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	7	9	yet now I am happy , not because you were made sorry , but because your sorrow led you to repentance . For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	7	10	Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret , but worldly sorrow brings death .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	7	11	See what this godly sorrow has produced in you : what earnestness , what eagerness to clear yourselves , what indignation , what alarm , what longing , what concern , what readiness to see justice done . At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	7	12	So even though I wrote to you , it was neither on account of the one who did the wrong nor on account of the injured party , but rather that before God you could see for yourselves how devoted to us you are .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	7	13	By all this we are encouraged . In addition to our own encouragement , we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was , because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	7	14	I had boasted to him about you , and you have not embarrassed me . But just as everything we said to you was true , so our boasting about you to Titus has proved to be true as well .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	7	15	And his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that you were all obedient , receiving him with fear and trembling .

NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	8	I am not commanding you , but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	3	For I testify that they gave as much as they were able , and even beyond their ability . Entirely on their own ,
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	4	they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the Lord ’ s people .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	5	And they exceeded our expectations : they gave themselves first of all to the Lord , and then by the will of God also to us .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	6	So we urged Titus , just as he had earlier made a beginning , to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	7	But since you excel in everything – in faith , in speech , in knowledge , in complete earnestness and in the love we have kindled in you [ a ] – see that you also excel in this grace of giving .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	9	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that though he was rich , yet for your sake he became poor , so that you through his poverty might become rich .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	10	And here is my judgment about what is best for you in this matter . Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	11	Now finish the work , so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it , according to your means .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	12	For if the willingness is there , the gift is acceptable according to what one has , not according to what one does not have .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	13	Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed , but that there might be equality .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	14	At the present time your plenty will supply what they need , so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need . The goal is equality ,
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	15	as it is written : ‘ The one who gathered much did not have too much , and the one who gathered little did not have too little. ’ [ b ] Titus sent to receive the collection
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	16	Thanks be to God , who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	17	For Titus not only welcomed our appeal , but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	18	And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	19	What is more , he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering , which we administer in order to honour the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	20	We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	21	For we are taking pains to do what is right , not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of man .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	22	In addition , we are sending with them our brother who has often proved to us in many ways that he is zealous , and now even more so because of his great confidence in you .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	23	As for Titus , he is my partner and fellow worker among you ; as for our brothers , they are representatives of the churches and an honour to Christ .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	8	24	Therefore show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you , so that the churches can see it . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	9	9	As it is written : ‘ They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor ; their righteousness endures for ever. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	9	3	But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow , but that you may be ready , as I said you would be .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	9	4	For if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared , we – not to say anything about you – would be ashamed of having been so confident .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	9	5	So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised . Then it will be ready as a generous gift , not as one grudgingly given . Generosity encouraged
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	9	6	Remember this : whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly , and whoever sows generously will also reap generously .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	9	7	Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give , not reluctantly or under compulsion , for God loves a cheerful giver .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to bless you abundantly , so that in all things at all times , having all that you need , you will abound in every good work .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	9	10	Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	9	11	You will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion , and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	9	12	This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of the Lord ’ s people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	9	13	Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves , others will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ , and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	9	14	And in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you , because of the surpassing grace God has given you .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	9	15	Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift ! Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	10	10	For some say , ‘ His letters are weighty and forceful , but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing. ’
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	10	3	For though we live in the world , we do not wage war as the world does .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	10	4	The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world . On the contrary , they have divine power to demolish strongholds .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	10	5	We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God , and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	10	6	And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience , once your obedience is complete .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	10	7	You are judging by appearances . [ a ] If anyone is confident that they belong to Christ , they should consider again that we belong to Christ just as much as they do .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	10	8	So even if I boast somewhat freely about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than tearing you down , I will not be ashamed of it .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	10	9	I do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	10	11	Such people should realise that what we are in our letters when we are absent , we will be in our actions when we are present .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	10	12	We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves . When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves , they are not wise .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	10	13	We , however , will not boast beyond proper limits , but will confine our boasting to the sphere of service God himself has assigned to us , a sphere that also includes you .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	10	14	We are not going too far in our boasting , as would be the case if we had not come to you , for we did get as far as you with the gospel of Christ .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	10	15	Neither do we go beyond our limits by boasting of work done by others . Our hope is that , as your faith continues to grow , our sphere of activity among you will greatly expand ,

NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	11	Why ? Because I do not love you ? God knows I do !
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	3	But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the snake ’ s cunning , your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	4	For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached , or if you receive a different spirit from the Spirit you received , or a different gospel from the one you accepted , you put up with it easily enough .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	5	I do not think I am in the least inferior to those ‘ super-apostles ’ . [ a ]
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	6	I may indeed be untrained as a speaker , but I do have knowledge . We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	7	Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge ?
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	9	And when I was with you and needed something , I was not a burden to anyone , for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed . I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way , and will continue to do so .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	10	As surely as the truth of Christ is in me , nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	12	And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	13	For such people are false apostles , deceitful workers , masquerading as apostles of Christ .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	14	And no wonder , for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	15	It is not surprising , then , if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness . Their end will be what their actions deserve . Paul boasts about his sufferings
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	16	I repeat : let no one take me for a fool . But if you do , then tolerate me just as you would a fool , so that I may do a little boasting .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	17	In this self-confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would , but as a fool .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Since many are boasting in the way the world does , I too will boast .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	19	You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise !
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	20	In fact , you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or puts on airs or slaps you in the face .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	21	To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that ! Whatever anyone else dares to boast about – I am speaking as a fool – I also dare to boast about .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they Abraham ’ s descendants ? So am I .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	23	Are they servants of Christ ? ( I am out of my mind to talk like this . ) I am more . I have worked much harder , been in prison more frequently , been flogged more severely , and been exposed to death again and again .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	24	Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	25	Three times I was beaten with rods , once I was pelted with stones , three times I was shipwrecked , I spent a night and a day in the open sea ,
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	26	I have been constantly on the move . I have been in danger from rivers , in danger from bandits , in danger from my fellow Jews , in danger from Gentiles ; in danger in the city , in danger in the country , in danger at sea ; and in danger from false believers .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	27	I have laboured and toiled and have often gone without sleep ; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food ; I have been cold and naked .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	28	Besides everything else , I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak , and I do not feel weak ? Who is led into sin , and I do not inwardly burn ?
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	30	If I must boast , I will boast of the things that show my weakness .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus , who is to be praised for ever , knows that I am not lying .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	32	In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	11	33	But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	12	I persevered in demonstrating among you the marks of a true apostle , including signs , wonders and miracles .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	3	And I know that this man – whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know , but God knows –
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	4	was caught up to paradise and heard inexpressible things , things that no one is permitted to tell .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	5	I will boast about a man like that , but I will not boast about myself , except about my weaknesses .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	6	Even if I should choose to boast , I would not be a fool , because I would be speaking the truth . But I refrain , so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say ,
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	7	or because of these surpassingly great revelations . Therefore , in order to keep me from becoming conceited , I was given a thorn in my flesh , a messenger of Satan , to torment me .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	8	Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	9	But he said to me , ‘ My grace is sufficient for you , for my power is made perfect in weakness. ’ Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses , so that Christ ’ s power may rest on me .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	10	That is why , for Christ ’ s sake , I delight in weaknesses , in insults , in hardships , in persecutions , in difficulties . For when I am weak , then I am strong . Paul ’ s concern for the Corinthians
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I have made a fool of myself , but you drove me to it . I ought to have been commended by you , for I am not in the least inferior to the ‘ super-apostles ’ , [ a ] even though I am nothing .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	13	How were you inferior to the other churches , except that I was never a burden to you ? Forgive me this wrong !
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	14	Now I am ready to visit you for the third time , and I will not be a burden to you , because what I want is not your possessions but you . After all , children should not have to save up for their parents , but parents for their children .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	15	So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well . If I love you more , will you love me less ?
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	16	Be that as it may , I have not been a burden to you . Yet , crafty fellow that I am , I caught you by trickery !
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	17	Did I exploit you through any of the men I sent to you ?
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	18	I urged Titus to go to you and I sent our brother with him . Titus did not exploit you , did he ? Did we not walk in the same footsteps by the same Spirit ?
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	19	Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you ? We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ ; and everything we do , dear friends , is for your strengthening .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	20	For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I want you to be , and you may not find me as you want me to be . I fear that there may be discord , jealousy , fits of rage , selfish ambition , slander , gossip , arrogance and disorder .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	12	21	I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you , and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity , sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	13	13	All God ’ s people here send their greetings .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	13	3	since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me . He is not weak in dealing with you , but is powerful among you .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	13	4	For to be sure , he was crucified in weakness , yet he lives by God ’ s power . Likewise , we are weak in him , yet by God ’ s power we will live with him in our dealing with you .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	13	5	Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith ; test yourselves . Do you not realise that Christ Jesus is in you – unless , of course , you fail the test ?
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	13	6	And I trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	13	7	Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong – not so that people will see that we have stood the test but so that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	13	8	For we can not do anything against the truth , but only for the truth .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	13	9	We are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong ; and our prayer is that you may be fully restored .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	13	10	This is why I write these things when I am absent , that when I come I may not have to be harsh in my use of authority – the authority the Lord gave me for building you up , not for tearing you down . Final greetings
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	13	11	Finally , brothers and sisters , rejoice ! Strive for full restoration , encourage one another , be of one mind , live in peace . And the God of love and peace will be with you .
NIVUK	2%20Corinthians	13	12	Greet one another with a holy kiss .

NIVUK	Galatians	1	1	Paul , an apostle – sent not from men nor by a man , but by Jesus Christ and God the Father , who raised him from the dead –
NIVUK	Galatians	1	2	and all the brothers and sisters [ a ] with me , To the churches in Galatia :
NIVUK	Galatians	1	3	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ,
NIVUK	Galatians	1	4	who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age , according to the will of our God and Father ,
NIVUK	Galatians	1	5	to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen . No other gospel
NIVUK	Galatians	1	6	I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel –
NIVUK	Galatians	1	7	which is really no gospel at all . Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ .
NIVUK	Galatians	1	8	But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you , let them be under God ’ s curse !
NIVUK	Galatians	1	9	As we have already said , so now I say again : if anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted , let them be under God ’ s curse !
NIVUK	Galatians	1	10	Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings , or of God ? Or am I trying to please people ? If I were still trying to please people , I would not be a servant of Christ . Paul called by God
NIVUK	Galatians	1	11	; and in 3:15 ; 4:12 ,

NIVUK	Galatians	1	14	I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers .

NIVUK	Galatians	1	16	to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles , my immediate response was not to consult any human being .
NIVUK	Galatians	1	17	I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was , but I went into Arabia . Later I returned to Damascus .

NIVUK	Galatians	2	2	I went in response to a revelation and , meeting privately with those esteemed as leaders , I presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles . I wanted to be sure I was not running and had not been running my race in vain .
NIVUK	Galatians	2	3	Yet not even Titus , who was with me , was compelled to be circumcised , even though he was a Greek .
NIVUK	Galatians	2	4	This matter arose because some false believers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves .
NIVUK	Galatians	2	5	We did not give in to them for a moment , so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you .
NIVUK	Galatians	2	6	As for those who were held in high esteem – whatever they were makes no difference to me ; God does not show favouritism – they added nothing to my message .
NIVUK	Galatians	2	7	On the contrary , they recognised that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the uncircumcised , [ a ] just as Peter had been to the circumcised . [ b ]

NIVUK	Galatians	2	9	- Galatians 2:9 That is , Peter ; also in verses

NIVUK	Galatians	2	15	‘ We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles

So we , too , have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in [ d ] Christ and not by the works of the law , because by the works of the law no one will be justified .
NIVUK	Galatians	2	17	‘ But if , in seeking to be justified in Christ , we Jews find ourselves also among the sinners , doesn ’ t that mean that Christ promotes sin ? Absolutely not !
NIVUK	Galatians	2	18	If I rebuild what I destroyed , then I really would be a law-breaker .
NIVUK	Galatians	2	19	‘ For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God .
NIVUK	Galatians	2	20	I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live , but Christ lives in me . The life I now live in the body , I live by faith in the Son of God , who loved me and gave himself for me .

NIVUK	Galatians	3	3	Are you so foolish ? After beginning by means of the Spirit , are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh ? [ a ]
NIVUK	Galatians	3	2	I would like to learn just one thing from you : did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law , or by believing what you heard ?
NIVUK	Galatians	3	4	Have you experienced [ b ] so much in vain – if it really was in vain ?
NIVUK	Galatians	3	5	So again I ask , does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law , or by your believing what you heard ?
NIVUK	Galatians	3	6	So also Abraham ‘ believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness. ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	Galatians	3	7	Understand , then , that those who have faith are children of Abraham .
NIVUK	Galatians	3	8	Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith , and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham : ‘ All nations will be blessed through you. ’ [ d ]
NIVUK	Galatians	3	9	So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham , the man of faith .
NIVUK	Galatians	3	10	For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse , as it is written : ‘ Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law. ’ [ e ]
NIVUK	Galatians	3	11	Clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before God , because ‘ the righteous will live by faith. ’ [ f ]
NIVUK	Galatians	3	12	The law is not based on faith ; on the contrary , it says , ‘ The person who does these things will live by them. ’ [ g ]
NIVUK	Galatians	3	13	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us , for it is written : ‘ Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole. ’ [ h ]
NIVUK	Galatians	3	14	He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus , so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit . The law and the promise
NIVUK	Galatians	3	15	Brothers and sisters , let me take an example from everyday life . Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established , so it is in this case .
NIVUK	Galatians	3	16	The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed . Scripture does not say ‘ and to seeds ’ , meaning many people , but ‘ and to your seed ’ , [ i ] meaning one person , who is Christ .
NIVUK	Galatians	3	17	What I mean is this : the law , introduced
NIVUK	Galatians	3	430	years later , does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise .
NIVUK	Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance depends on the law , then it no longer depends on the promise ; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise .
NIVUK	Galatians	3	19	Why , then , was the law given at all ? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come . The law was given through angels and entrusted to a mediator .
NIVUK	Galatians	3	20	A mediator , however , implies more than one party ; but God is one .
NIVUK	Galatians	3	21	Is the law , therefore , opposed to the promises of God ? Absolutely not ! For if a law had been given that could impart life , then righteousness would certainly have come by the law .
NIVUK	Galatians	3	22	But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin , so that what was promised , being given through faith in Jesus Christ , might be given to those who believe . Children of God
NIVUK	Galatians	3	23	Before faith came Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	Galatians	3	24	So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith .
NIVUK	Galatians	3	25	Now that this faith has come , we are no longer under a guardian .
NIVUK	Galatians	3	26	So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith ,
NIVUK	Galatians	3	27	for all of you who were baptised into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ .
NIVUK	Galatians	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Gentile , neither slave nor free , nor is there male and female , for you are all one in Christ Jesus .
NIVUK	Galatians	3	29	If you belong to Christ , then you are Abraham ’ s seed , and heirs according to the promise .

NIVUK	Galatians	4	4	But when the set time had fully come , God sent his Son , born of a woman , born under the law ,
NIVUK	Galatians	4	2	The heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father .
NIVUK	Galatians	4	3	So also , when we were under age , we were in slavery under the elemental spiritual forces [ a ] of the world .
NIVUK	Galatians	4	5	to redeem those under the law , that we might receive adoption to sonship . [ b ]
NIVUK	Galatians	4	6	Because you are his sons , God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts , the Spirit who calls out , ‘ Abba , [ c ] Father. ’
NIVUK	Galatians	4	7	So you are no longer a slave , but God ’ s child ; and since you are his child , God has made you also an heir . Paul ’ s concern for the Galatians
NIVUK	Galatians	4	8	Formerly , when you did not know God , you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods .
NIVUK	Galatians	4	9	But now that you know God – or rather are known by God – how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable forces [ d ] ? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again ?
NIVUK	Galatians	4	10	You are observing special days and months and seasons and years !
NIVUK	Galatians	4	11	I fear for you , that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you .
NIVUK	Galatians	4	12	I plead with you , brothers and sisters , become like me , for I became like you . You did me no wrong .
NIVUK	Galatians	4	13	As you know , it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you ,
NIVUK	Galatians	4	14	and even though my illness was a trial to you , you did not treat me with contempt or scorn . Instead , you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God , as if I were Christ Jesus himself .
NIVUK	Galatians	4	15	Where , then , is your blessing of me now ? I can testify that , if you could have done so , you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me .
NIVUK	Galatians	4	16	Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth ?
NIVUK	Galatians	4	17	Those people are zealous to win you over , but for no good . What they want is to alienate you from us , so that you may have zeal for them .
NIVUK	Galatians	4	18	It is fine to be zealous , provided the purpose is good , and to be so always , not just when I am with you .
NIVUK	Galatians	4	19	My dear children , for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you ,
NIVUK	Galatians	4	20	how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone , because I am perplexed about you ! Hagar and Sarah
NIVUK	Galatians	4	21	Tell me , you who want to be under the law , are you not aware of what the law says ?
NIVUK	Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman .
NIVUK	Galatians	4	23	His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh , but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise .
NIVUK	Galatians	4	24	These things are being taken figuratively : the women represent two covenants . One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves : this is Hagar .
NIVUK	Galatians	4	25	Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem , because she is in slavery with her children .
NIVUK	Galatians	4	26	But the Jerusalem that is above is free , and she is our mother .
NIVUK	Galatians	4	27	For it is written : ‘ Be glad , barren woman , you who never bore a child ; break forth and cry aloud , you who were never in labour ; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband. ’ [ e ]
NIVUK	Galatians	4	28	Now you , brothers and sisters , like Isaac , are children of promise .
NIVUK	Galatians	4	29	At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit . It is the same now .
NIVUK	Galatians	4	30	But what does Scripture say ? ‘ Get rid of the slave woman and her son , for the slave woman ’ s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman ’ s son. ’ [ f ]
NIVUK	Galatians	4	31	Therefore , brothers and sisters , we are not children of the slave woman , but of the free woman .

NIVUK	Galatians	5	5	For through the Spirit we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope .
NIVUK	Galatians	5	2	Mark my words ! I , Paul , tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised , Christ will be of no value to you at all .
NIVUK	Galatians	5	3	Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is required to obey the whole law .
NIVUK	Galatians	5	4	You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ ; you have fallen away from grace .
NIVUK	Galatians	5	6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value . The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love .
NIVUK	Galatians	5	7	You were running a good race . Who cut in on you to keep you from obeying the truth ?
NIVUK	Galatians	5	8	That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you .
NIVUK	Galatians	5	9	‘ A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough. ’
NIVUK	Galatians	5	10	I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view . The one who is throwing you into confusion , whoever that may be , will have to pay the penalty .
NIVUK	Galatians	5	11	Brothers and sisters , if I am still preaching circumcision , why am I still being persecuted ? In that case the offence of the cross has been abolished .
NIVUK	Galatians	5	12	As for those agitators , I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves ! Life by the Spirit
NIVUK	Galatians	5	13	You , my brothers and sisters , were called to be free . But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh [ a ] ; rather , serve one another humbly in love .
NIVUK	Galatians	5	14	For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command : ‘ Love your neighbour as yourself. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	Galatians	5	15	If you bite and devour each other , watch out or you will be destroyed by each other .
NIVUK	Galatians	5	16	,
NIVUK	Galatians	5	17	,
NIVUK	Galatians	5	18	But if you are led by the Spirit , you are not under the law .
NIVUK	Galatians	5	19	and
NIVUK	Galatians	5	20	idolatry and witchcraft ; hatred , discord , jealousy , fits of rage , selfish ambition , dissensions , factions
NIVUK	Galatians	5	21	and envy ; drunkenness , orgies , and the like . I warn you , as I did before , that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God .
NIVUK	Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , forbearance , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
NIVUK	Galatians	5	23	gentleness and self-control . Against such things there is no law .

NIVUK	Galatians	5	25	Since we live by the Spirit , let us keep in step with the Spirit .
NIVUK	Galatians	5	26	Let us not become conceited , provoking and envying each other . Footnotes - Galatians 5:13 In contexts like this , the Greek word for flesh ( sarx ) refers to the sinful state of human beings , often presented as a power in opposition to the Spirit ; also in verses

NIVUK	Galatians	6	6	Nevertheless , the one who receives instruction in the word should share all good things with their instructor .
NIVUK	Galatians	6	2	Carry each other ’ s burdens , and in this way you will fulfil the law of Christ .
NIVUK	Galatians	6	3	If anyone thinks they are something when they are not , they deceive themselves .
NIVUK	Galatians	6	4	Each one should test their own actions . Then they can take pride in themselves alone , without comparing themselves to someone else ,
NIVUK	Galatians	6	5	for each one should carry their own load .
NIVUK	Galatians	6	7	Do not be deceived : God can not be mocked . A man reaps what he sows .
NIVUK	Galatians	6	8	Whoever sows to please their flesh , from the flesh will reap destruction ; whoever sows to please the Spirit , from the Spirit will reap eternal life .
NIVUK	Galatians	6	9	Let us not become weary in doing good , for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up .
NIVUK	Galatians	6	10	Therefore , as we have opportunity , let us do good to all people , especially to those who belong to the family of believers . Not circumcision but the new creation
NIVUK	Galatians	6	11	See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand !
NIVUK	Galatians	6	12	Those who want to impress people by means of the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised . The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ .
NIVUK	Galatians	6	13	Not even those who are circumcised keep the law , yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your circumcision in the flesh .
NIVUK	Galatians	6	14	May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through which [ a ] the world has been crucified to me , and I to the world .
NIVUK	Galatians	6	15	Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything ; what counts is the new creation .
NIVUK	Galatians	6	16	Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule – to [ b ] the Israel of God .
NIVUK	Galatians	6	17	From now on , let no one cause me trouble , for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus .
NIVUK	Galatians	6	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit , brothers and sisters . Amen . Footnotes - Galatians 6:14 Or whom - Galatians 6:16 Or rule and to Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Ephesians	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , To God ’ s holy people in Ephesus , [ a ] the faithful in Christ Jesus :
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	2	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Praise for spiritual blessings in Christ
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	3	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ .
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	4	For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight . In love
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	5	He - Ephesians 1:5 The Greek word for adoption to sonship is a legal term referring to the full legal standing of an adopted male heir in Roman culture . - Ephesians 1:9 Or us with all wisdom and understanding .
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	6	to the praise of his glorious grace , which he has freely given us in the One he loves .
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	7	In him we have redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of sins , in accordance with the riches of God ’ s grace
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	8	that he lavished on us . With all wisdom and understanding ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	9	And he - Ephesians 1:11 Or were made heirs - Ephesians 1:17 Or a spirit Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	10	to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfilment – to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ .
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	11	In him we were also chosen , [ e ] having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	12	in order that we , who were the first to put our hope in Christ , might be for the praise of his glory .
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	13	And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth , the gospel of your salvation . When you believed , you were marked in him with a seal , the promised Holy Spirit ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	14	who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God ’ s possession – to the praise of his glory . Thanksgiving and prayer
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	15	For this reason , ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God ’ s people ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	16	I have not stopped giving thanks for you , remembering you in my prayers .
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	17	I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the glorious Father , may give you the Spirit [ f ] of wisdom and revelation , so that you may know him better .
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	18	I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you , the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	19	and his incomparably great power for us who believe . That power is the same as the mighty strength
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	20	he exerted when he raised Christ from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	21	far above all rule and authority , power and dominion , and every name that is invoked , not only in the present age but also in the one to come .
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	22	And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	1	23	which is his body , the fullness of him who fills everything in every way . Footnotes - Ephesians 1:1 Some early manuscripts do not have in Ephesus . - Ephesians 1:5 Or sight in love .

NIVUK	Ephesians	2	2	in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air , the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient .
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	3	All of us also lived among them at one time , gratifying the cravings of our flesh [ a ] and following its desires and thoughts . Like the rest , we were by nature deserving of wrath .
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	4	But because of his great love for us , God , who is rich in mercy ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	5	made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions – it is by grace you have been saved .
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	6	And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	7	in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace , expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus .
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	8	For it is by grace you have been saved , through faith – and this is not from yourselves , it is the gift of God –
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	9	not by works , so that no one can boast .
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	10	For we are God ’ s handiwork , created in Christ Jesus to do good works , which God prepared in advance for us to do . Jew and Gentile reconciled through Christ
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	11	Therefore , remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called ‘ uncircumcised ’ by those who call themselves ‘ the circumcision ’ ( which is done in the body by human hands ) –
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	12	remember that at that time you were separate from Christ , excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise , without hope and without God in the world .
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	13	But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ .
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	14	For he himself is our peace , who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier , the dividing wall of hostility ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	15	by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations . His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two , thus making peace ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	16	and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross , by which he put to death their hostility .
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	17	He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near .
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	18	For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit .
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	19	Consequently , you are no longer foreigners and strangers , but fellow citizens with God ’ s people and also members of his household ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	20	built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets , with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone .
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	21	In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord .
NIVUK	Ephesians	2	22	And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit .

NIVUK	Ephesians	3	3	that is , the mystery made known to me by revelation , as I have already written briefly .
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	2	Surely you have heard about the administration of God ’ s grace that was given to me for you ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	4	In reading this , then , you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	5	which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God ’ s holy apostles and prophets .
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	6	This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel , members together of one body , and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus .
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	7	I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God ’ s grace given me through the working of his power .
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	8	Although I am less than the least of all the Lord ’ s people , this grace was given me : to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	9	and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery , which for ages past was kept hidden in God , who created all things .
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	10	His intent was that now , through the church , the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	11	according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord .
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	12	In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence .
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	13	I ask you , therefore , not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you , which are your glory . A prayer for the Ephesians
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	14	For this reason I kneel before the Father ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	15	from whom every family [ a ] in heaven and on earth derives its name .
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	16	I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	17	so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith . And I pray that you , being rooted and established in love ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	18	may have power , together with all the Lord ’ s holy people , to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	19	and to know this love that surpasses knowledge – that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God .
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	20	Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine , according to his power that is at work within us ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	3	21	to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations , for ever and ever ! Amen .

NIVUK	Ephesians	4	4	There is one body and one Spirit , just as you were called to one hope when you were called ;
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	2	Be completely humble and gentle ; be patient , bearing with one another in love .
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	3	Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace .
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	5	one Lord , one faith , one baptism ;
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	6	one God and Father of all , who is over all and through all and in all .
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	7	But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it .
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	8	This is why it [ a ] says : ‘ When he ascended on high , he took many captives and gave gifts to his people. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	9	( What does ‘ he ascended ’ mean except that he also descended to the lower , earthly regions [ c ] ?
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	10	He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens , in order to fill the whole universe . )
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	11	So Christ himself gave the apostles , the prophets , the evangelists , the pastors and teachers ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	12	to equip his people for works of service , so that the body of Christ may be built up
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	13	until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature , attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ .
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	14	Then we will no longer be infants , tossed back and forth by the waves , and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming .
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	15	Instead , speaking the truth in love , we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head , that is , Christ .
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	16	From him the whole body , joined and held together by every supporting ligament , grows and builds itself up in love , as each part does its work . Instructions for Christian living
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	17	So I tell you this , and insist on it in the Lord , that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do , in the futility of their thinking .
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	18	They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts .
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	19	Having lost all sensitivity , they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity , and they are full of greed .
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	20	That , however , is not the way of life you learned
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	21	when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus .
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	22	You were taught , with regard to your former way of life , to put off your old self , which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires ;
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	23	to be made new in the attitude of your minds ;
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	24	and to put on the new self , created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness .
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	25	Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbour , for we are all members of one body .
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	26	‘ In your anger do not sin ’ [ d ] : do not let the sun go down while you are still angry ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	27	and do not give the devil a foothold .
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	28	Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer , but must work , doing something useful with their own hands , that they may have something to share with those in need .
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	29	Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths , but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs , that it may benefit those who listen .
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	30	And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God , with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption .
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	31	Get rid of all bitterness , rage and anger , brawling and slander , along with every form of malice .
NIVUK	Ephesians	4	32	Be kind and compassionate to one another , forgiving each other , just as in Christ God forgave you .

NIVUK	Ephesians	5	5	For of this you can be sure : no immoral , impure or greedy person – such a person is an idolater – has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God . [ a ]
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	1	Follow God ’ s example , therefore , as dearly loved children
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	2	and live a life of love , just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	3	But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality , or of any kind of impurity , or of greed , because these are improper for God ’ s holy people .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	4	Nor should there be obscenity , foolish talk or coarse joking , which are out of place , but rather thanksgiving .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	6	Let no one deceive you with empty words , for because of such things God ’ s wrath comes on those who are disobedient .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	7	Therefore do not be partners with them .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	8	For you were once darkness , but now you are light in the Lord . Live as children of light
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	9	( for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness , righteousness and truth )
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	10	and find out what pleases the Lord .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	11	Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness , but rather expose them .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	12	It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	13	But everything exposed by the light becomes visible – and everything that is illuminated becomes a light .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	14	This is why it is said : ‘ Wake up , sleeper , rise from the dead , and Christ will shine on you. ’
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	15	Be very careful , then , how you live – not as unwise but as wise ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	16	making the most of every opportunity , because the days are evil .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	17	Therefore do not be foolish , but understand what the Lord ’ s will is .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	18	Do not get drunk on wine , which leads to debauchery . Instead , be filled with the Spirit ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	19	speaking to one another with psalms , hymns , and songs from the Spirit . Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	20	always giving thanks to God the Father for everything , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ . Instructions for Christian households
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	21	Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	22	Wives , submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	23	For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church , his body , of which he is the Saviour .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	24	Now as the church submits to Christ , so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	25	Husbands , love your wives , just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	26	to make her holy , cleansing [ b ] her by the washing with water through the word ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	27	and to present her to himself as a radiant church , without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish , but holy and blameless .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	28	In this same way , husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies . He who loves his wife loves himself .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	29	After all , no one ever hated their own body , but they feed and care for their body , just as Christ does the church –
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	30	for we are members of his body .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	31	‘ For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife , and the two will become one flesh. ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	32	This is a profound mystery – but I am talking about Christ and the church .
NIVUK	Ephesians	5	33	However , each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself , and the wife must respect her husband .

NIVUK	Ephesians	6	6	Obey them not only to win their favour when their eye is on you , but as slaves of Christ , doing the will of God from your heart .
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	2	‘ Honour your father and mother ’ – which is the first commandment with a promise –
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	3	‘ so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	4	Fathers , [ b ] do not exasperate your children ; instead , bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord .
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	5	Slaves , obey your earthly masters with respect and fear , and with sincerity of heart , just as you would obey Christ .
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	7	Serve wholeheartedly , as if you were serving the Lord , not people ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	8	because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do , whether they are slave or free .
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	9	And masters , treat your slaves in the same way . Do not threaten them , since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven , and there is no favouritism with him . The armour of God
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	10	Finally , be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power .
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	11	Put on the full armour of God , so that you can take your stand against the devil ’ s schemes .
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	12	For our struggle is not against flesh and blood , but against the rulers , against the authorities , against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms .
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	13	Therefore put on the full armour of God , so that when the day of evil comes , you may be able to stand your ground , and after you have done everything , to stand .
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	14	Stand firm then , with the belt of truth buckled round your waist , with the breastplate of righteousness in place ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	15	and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace .
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	16	In addition to all this , take up the shield of faith , with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one .
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	17	Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God .
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	18	And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests . With this in mind , be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord ’ s people .
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	19	Pray also for me , that whenever I speak , words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel ,
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	20	for which I am an ambassador in chains . Pray that I may declare it fearlessly , as I should . Final greetings
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	21	Tychicus , the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord , will tell you everything , so that you also may know how I am and what I am doing .
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	22	I am sending him to you for this very purpose , that you may know how we are , and that he may encourage you .
NIVUK	Ephesians	6	23	Peace to the brothers and sisters , [ c ] and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .

NIVUK	Philippians	1	12	Now I want you to know , brothers and sisters , [ b ] that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel .
NIVUK	Philippians	1	13	,
NIVUK	Philippians	1	14	; and in 3:1 ,
NIVUK	Philippians	1	15	It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry , but others out of goodwill .
NIVUK	Philippians	1	16	The latter do so out of love , knowing that I am put here for the defence of the gospel .
NIVUK	Philippians	1	17	; 4:1 ,
NIVUK	Philippians	1	18	But what does it matter ? The important thing is that in every way , whether from false motives or true , Christ is preached . And because of this I rejoice . Yes , and I will continue to rejoice ,
NIVUK	Philippians	1	19	for I know that through your prayers and God ’ s provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance . [ d ]
NIVUK	Philippians	1	20	I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed , but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body , whether by life or by death .

NIVUK	Philippians	1	22	If I am to go on living in the body , this will mean fruitful labour for me . Yet what shall I choose ? I do not know !
NIVUK	Philippians	1	23	I am torn between the two : I desire to depart and be with Christ , which is better by far ;
NIVUK	Philippians	1	24	but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body .
NIVUK	Philippians	1	25	Convinced of this , I know that I will remain , and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith ,
NIVUK	Philippians	1	26	so that through my being with you again your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me . Life worthy of the gospel
NIVUK	Philippians	1	27	Whatever happens , conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ . Then , whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence , I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit , [ e ] striving together as one for the faith of the gospel
NIVUK	Philippians	1	28	without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you . This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed , but that you will be saved – and that by God .
NIVUK	Philippians	1	29	For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him , but also to suffer for him ,
NIVUK	Philippians	1	30	since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had , and now hear that I still have . Footnotes - Philippians 1:1 The word deacons refers here to Christians designated to serve with the overseers/elders of the church in a variety of ways ; similarly in Romans 16:1 and

NIVUK	Philippians	2	2	then make my joy complete by being like-minded , having the same love , being one in spirit and of one mind .
NIVUK	Philippians	2	3	Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit . Rather , in humility value others above yourselves ,
NIVUK	Philippians	2	4	not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others .
NIVUK	Philippians	2	5	In your relationships with one another , have the same mindset as Christ Jesus :
NIVUK	Philippians	2	6	who , being in very nature [ a ] God , did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage ;
NIVUK	Philippians	2	7	rather , he made himself nothing by taking the very nature [ b ] of a servant , being made in human likeness .
NIVUK	Philippians	2	8	And being found in appearance as a man , he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death – even death on a cross !
NIVUK	Philippians	2	9	Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name ,
NIVUK	Philippians	2	10	that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow , in heaven and on earth and under the earth ,
NIVUK	Philippians	2	11	and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father . Do everything without grumbling
NIVUK	Philippians	2	12	Therefore , my dear friends , as you have always obeyed – not only in my presence , but now much more in my absence – continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling ,
NIVUK	Philippians	2	13	for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfil his good purpose .
NIVUK	Philippians	2	14	Do everything without grumbling or arguing ,
NIVUK	Philippians	2	15	so that you may become blameless and pure , ‘ children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation. ’ [ c ] Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky
NIVUK	Philippians	2	16	as you hold firmly to the word of life . And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labour in vain .
NIVUK	Philippians	2	17	But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith , I am glad and rejoice with all of you .
NIVUK	Philippians	2	18	So you too should be glad and rejoice with me . Timothy and Epaphroditus
NIVUK	Philippians	2	19	I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon , that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you .
NIVUK	Philippians	2	20	I have no one else like him , who will show genuine concern for your welfare .
NIVUK	Philippians	2	21	For everyone looks out for their own interests , not those of Jesus Christ .
NIVUK	Philippians	2	22	But you know that Timothy has proved himself , because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel .
NIVUK	Philippians	2	23	I hope , therefore , to send him as soon as I see how things go with me .
NIVUK	Philippians	2	24	And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon .
NIVUK	Philippians	2	25	But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus , my brother , co-worker and fellow soldier , who is also your messenger , whom you sent to take care of my needs .
NIVUK	Philippians	2	26	For he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill.
NIVUK	Philippians	2	27	Indeed he was ill , and almost died . But God had mercy on him , and not on him only but also on me , to spare me sorrow upon sorrow .
NIVUK	Philippians	2	28	Therefore I am all the more eager to send him , so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety .
NIVUK	Philippians	2	29	So then , welcome him in the Lord with great joy , and honour people like him ,
NIVUK	Philippians	2	30	because he almost died for the work of Christ . He risked his life to make up for the help you yourselves could not give me .

NIVUK	Philippians	3	3	For it is we who are the circumcision , we who serve God by his Spirit , who boast in Christ Jesus , and who put no confidence in the flesh –
NIVUK	Philippians	3	2	Watch out for those dogs , those evildoers , those mutilators of the flesh .
NIVUK	Philippians	3	4	though I myself have reasons for such confidence . If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh , I have more :
NIVUK	Philippians	3	5	circumcised on the eighth day , of the people of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of Hebrews ; in regard to the law , a Pharisee ;
NIVUK	Philippians	3	6	as for zeal , persecuting the church ; as for righteousness based on the law , faultless .
NIVUK	Philippians	3	7	But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ .
NIVUK	Philippians	3	8	What is more , I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord , for whose sake I have lost all things . I consider them garbage , that I may gain Christ
NIVUK	Philippians	3	9	and be found in him , not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law , but that which is through faith in [ a ] Christ – the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith .
NIVUK	Philippians	3	10	I want to know Christ – yes , to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings , becoming like him in his death ,
NIVUK	Philippians	3	11	and so , somehow , attaining to the resurrection from the dead .
NIVUK	Philippians	3	12	Not that I have already obtained all this , or have already arrived at my goal , but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me .
NIVUK	Philippians	3	13	Brothers and sisters , I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it . But one thing I do : forgetting what is behind and straining towards what is ahead ,
NIVUK	Philippians	3	14	I press on towards the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenwards in Christ Jesus . Following Paul ’ s example
NIVUK	Philippians	3	15	All of us , then , who are mature should take such a view of things . And if on some point you think differently , that too God will make clear to you .
NIVUK	Philippians	3	16	Only let us live up to what we have already attained .
NIVUK	Philippians	3	17	Join together in following my example , brothers and sisters , and just as you have us as a model , keep your eyes on those who live as we do .
NIVUK	Philippians	3	18	For , as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears , many live as enemies of the cross of Christ .
NIVUK	Philippians	3	19	Their destiny is destruction , their god is their stomach , and their glory is in their shame . Their mind is set on earthly things .
NIVUK	Philippians	3	20	But our citizenship is in heaven . And we eagerly await a Saviour from there , the Lord Jesus Christ ,
NIVUK	Philippians	3	21	who , by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control , will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body .

NIVUK	Philippians	4	4	Rejoice in the Lord always . I will say it again : rejoice !
NIVUK	Philippians	4	2	I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord .
NIVUK	Philippians	4	3	Yes , and I ask you , my true companion , help these women since they have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel , along with Clement and the rest of my co-workers , whose names are in the book of life . Final exhortations
NIVUK	Philippians	4	5	Let your gentleness be evident to all . The Lord is near .
NIVUK	Philippians	4	6	Do not be anxious about anything , but in every situation , by prayer and petition , with thanksgiving , present your requests to God .
NIVUK	Philippians	4	7	And the peace of God , which transcends all understanding , will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus .
NIVUK	Philippians	4	8	Finally , brothers and sisters , whatever is true , whatever is noble , whatever is right , whatever is pure , whatever is lovely , whatever is admirable – if anything is excellent or praiseworthy – think about such things .
NIVUK	Philippians	4	9	Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me , or seen in me – put it into practice . And the God of peace will be with you . Thanks for their gifts
NIVUK	Philippians	4	10	I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me . Indeed , you were concerned , but you had no opportunity to show it .
NIVUK	Philippians	4	11	I am not saying this because I am in need , for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances .
NIVUK	Philippians	4	12	I know what it is to be in need , and I know what it is to have plenty . I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation , whether well fed or hungry , whether living in plenty or in want .
NIVUK	Philippians	4	13	I can do all this through him who gives me strength .
NIVUK	Philippians	4	14	Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles .
NIVUK	Philippians	4	15	Moreover , as you Philippians know , in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel , when I set out from Macedonia , not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving , except you only ;
NIVUK	Philippians	4	16	for even when I was in Thessalonica , you sent me aid more than once when I was in need .
NIVUK	Philippians	4	17	Not that I desire your gifts ; what I desire is that more be credited to your account .
NIVUK	Philippians	4	18	I have received full payment and have more than enough . I am amply supplied , now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent . They are a fragrant offering , an acceptable sacrifice , pleasing to God .
NIVUK	Philippians	4	19	And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus .
NIVUK	Philippians	4	20	To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever . Amen . Final greetings
NIVUK	Philippians	4	21	Greet all God ’ s people in Christ Jesus . The brothers and sisters who are with me send greetings .
NIVUK	Philippians	4	22	All God ’ s people here send you greetings , especially those who belong to Caesar ’ s household .

NIVUK	Colossians	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and Timothy our brother ,
NIVUK	Colossians	1	2	To God ’ s holy people in Colossae , the faithful brothers and sisters [ a ] in Christ : Grace and peace to you from God our Father . [ b ] Thanksgiving and prayer
NIVUK	Colossians	1	3	We always thank God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , when we pray for you ,
NIVUK	Colossians	1	4	because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all God ’ s people –
NIVUK	Colossians	1	5	the faith and love that spring from the hope stored up for you in heaven and about which you have already heard in the true message of the gospel
NIVUK	Colossians	1	6	that has come to you . In the same way , the gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world – just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood God ’ s grace .
NIVUK	Colossians	1	7	You learned it from Epaphras , our dear fellow servant , [ c ] who is a faithful minister of Christ on our [ d ] behalf ,
NIVUK	Colossians	1	8	and who also told us of your love in the Spirit .
NIVUK	Colossians	1	9	For this reason , since the day we heard about you , we have not stopped praying for you . We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives , [ e ]
NIVUK	Colossians	1	10	so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way : bearing fruit in every good work , growing in the knowledge of God ,
NIVUK	Colossians	1	11	being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience ,
NIVUK	Colossians	1	12	and giving joyful thanks to the Father , who has qualified you [ f ] to share in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light .
NIVUK	Colossians	1	13	For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves ,
NIVUK	Colossians	1	14	in whom we have redemption , the forgiveness of sins . The supremacy of the Son of God
NIVUK	Colossians	1	15	The Son is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn over all creation .
NIVUK	Colossians	1	16	For in him all things were created : things in heaven and on earth , visible and invisible , whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities ; all things have been created through him and for him .
NIVUK	Colossians	1	17	He is before all things , and in him all things hold together .
NIVUK	Colossians	1	18	And he is the head of the body , the church ; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead , so that in everything he might have the supremacy .
NIVUK	Colossians	1	19	For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him ,
NIVUK	Colossians	1	20	and through him to reconcile to himself all things , whether things on earth or things in heaven , by making peace through his blood , shed on the cross .
NIVUK	Colossians	1	21	Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of [ g ] your evil behaviour .
NIVUK	Colossians	1	22	But now he has reconciled you by Christ ’ s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight , without blemish and free from accusation –
NIVUK	Colossians	1	23	if you continue in your faith , established and firm , and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel . This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven , and of which I , Paul , have become a servant . Paul ’ s labour for the church
NIVUK	Colossians	1	24	Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you , and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ ’ s afflictions , for the sake of his body , which is the church .
NIVUK	Colossians	1	25	I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness –
NIVUK	Colossians	1	26	the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations , but is now disclosed to the Lord ’ s people .
NIVUK	Colossians	1	27	To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery , which is Christ in you , the hope of glory .
NIVUK	Colossians	1	28	He is the one we proclaim , admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom , so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ .
NIVUK	Colossians	1	29	To this end I strenuously contend with all the energy Christ so powerfully works in me .

NIVUK	Colossians	2	2	My goal is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love , so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding , in order that they may know the mystery of God , namely , Christ ,
NIVUK	Colossians	2	3	in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
NIVUK	Colossians	2	4	I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine-sounding arguments .
NIVUK	Colossians	2	5	For though I am absent from you in body , I am present with you in spirit and delight to see how disciplined you are and how firm your faith in Christ is . Spiritual fullness in Christ
NIVUK	Colossians	2	6	So then , just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord , continue to live your lives in him ,
NIVUK	Colossians	2	7	rooted and built up in him , strengthened in the faith as you were taught , and overflowing with thankfulness .
NIVUK	Colossians	2	8	See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy , which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces [ a ] of this world rather than on Christ .
NIVUK	Colossians	2	9	For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form ,
NIVUK	Colossians	2	10	and in Christ you have been brought to fullness . He is the head over every power and authority .
NIVUK	Colossians	2	11	In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands . Your whole self ruled by the flesh [ b ] was put off when you were circumcised by [ c ] Christ ,
NIVUK	Colossians	2	12	having been buried with him in baptism , in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God , who raised him from the dead .

NIVUK	Colossians	2	16	Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink , or with regard to a religious festival , a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day .
NIVUK	Colossians	2	17	These are a shadow of the things that were to come ; the reality , however , is found in Christ .
NIVUK	Colossians	2	18	Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you . Such a person also goes into great detail about what they have seen ; they are puffed up with idle notions by their unspiritual mind .
NIVUK	Colossians	2	19	They have lost connection with the head , from whom the whole body , supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews , grows as God causes it to grow .

NIVUK	Colossians	2	21	‘ Do not handle ! Do not taste ! Do not touch ! ’ ?
NIVUK	Colossians	2	22	These rules , which have to do with things that are all destined to perish with use , are based on merely human commands and teachings .
NIVUK	Colossians	2	23	Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom , with their self-imposed worship , their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body , but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence . Footnotes - Colossians 2:8 Or the basic principles ; also in verse

NIVUK	Colossians	3	7	You used to walk in these ways , in the life you once lived .

NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	1	4	,

NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	1	6	You became imitators of us and of the Lord , for you welcomed the message in the midst of severe suffering with the joy given by the Holy Spirit .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	1	7	And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	1	8	The Lord ’ s message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia – your faith in God has become known everywhere . Therefore we do not need to say anything about it ,

NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	2	We had previously suffered and been treated outrageously in Philippi , as you know , but with the help of our God we dared to tell you his gospel in the face of strong opposition .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	3	For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives , nor are we trying to trick you .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	4	On the contrary , we speak as those approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel . We are not trying to please people but God , who tests our hearts .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	5	You know we never used flattery , nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed – God is our witness .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	6	We were not looking for praise from people , not from you or anyone else , even though as apostles of Christ we could have asserted our authority .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	7	Instead , we were like young children [ a ] among you . Just as a nursing mother cares for her children ,
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	8	so we cared for you . Because we loved you so much , we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	9	Surely you remember , brothers and sisters , our toil and hardship ; we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	10	You are witnesses , and so is God , of how holy , righteous and blameless we were among you who believed .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	11	For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children ,
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	12	encouraging , comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God , who calls you into his kingdom and glory .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	13	And we also thank God continually because , when you received the word of God , which you heard from us , you accepted it not as a human word , but as it actually is , the word of God , which is indeed at work in you who believe .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	For you , brothers and sisters , became imitators of God ’ s churches in Judea , which are in Christ Jesus : you suffered from your own people the same things those churches suffered from the Jews
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	15	who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out . They displease God and are hostile to everyone
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	16	in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved . In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit . The wrath of God has come upon them at last . [ b ] Paul ’ s longing to see the Thessalonians
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	17	But , brothers and sisters , when we were orphaned by being separated from you for a short time ( in person , not in thought ) , out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	18	For we wanted to come to you – certainly I , Paul , did , again and again – but Satan blocked our way .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	19	For what is our hope , our joy , or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes ? Is it not you ?
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	2	20	Indeed , you are our glory and joy . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	3	3	so that no one would be unsettled by these trials . For you know quite well that we are destined for them .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	3	2	We sent Timothy , who is our brother and co-worker in God ’ s service in spreading the gospel of Christ , to strengthen and encourage you in your faith ,
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	3	4	In fact , when we were with you , we kept telling you that we would be persecuted . And it turned out that way , as you well know .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	3	5	For this reason , when I could stand it no longer , I sent to find out about your faith . I was afraid that in some way the tempter had tempted you and that our labours might have been in vain . Timothy ’ s encouraging report
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	3	6	But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love . He has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us and that you long to see us , just as we also long to see you .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	3	7	Therefore , brothers and sisters , in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	3	8	For now we really live , since you are standing firm in the Lord .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	3	9	How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you ?
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	3	10	Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	3	11	Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to come to you .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	3	12	May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else , just as ours does for you .

NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	4	4	that each of you should learn to control your own body [ a ] in a way that is holy and honourable ,
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	4	2	For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	4	3	It is God ’ s will that you should be sanctified : that you should avoid sexual immorality ;
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	4	5	not in passionate lust like the pagans , who do not know God ;
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	4	6	and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister . [ b ] The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins , as we told you and warned you before .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	4	7	For God did not call us to be impure , but to live a holy life .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	4	8	Therefore , anyone who rejects this instruction does not reject a human being but God , the very God who gives you his Holy Spirit .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	4	9	Now about your love for one another we do not need to write to you , for you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	4	10	And in fact , you do love all of God ’ s family throughout Macedonia . Yet we urge you , brothers and sisters , to do so more and more ,
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	4	11	and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life : you should mind your own business and work with your hands , just as we told you ,
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	4	12	so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody . Believers who have died
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	4	13	Brothers and sisters , we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death , so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind , who have no hope .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	4	14	For we believe that Jesus died and rose again , and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	4	15	According to the Lord ’ s word , we tell you that we who are still alive , who are left until the coming of the Lord , will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	4	16	For the Lord himself will come down from heaven , with a loud command , with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God , and the dead in Christ will rise first .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	4	17	After that , we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air . And so we will be with the Lord for ever .

NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	5	4	But you , brothers and sisters , are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	5	6	So then , let us not be like others , who are asleep , but let us be awake and sober .
NIVUK	1%20Thessalonians	5	7	For those who sleep , sleep at night , and those who get drunk , get drunk at night .

NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	1	1	Paul , Silas [ a ] and Timothy , To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	1	3	We ought always to thank God for you , brothers and sisters , [ b ] and rightly so , because your faith is growing more and more , and the love all of you have for one another is increasing .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	1	4	Therefore , among God ’ s churches we boast about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and trials you are enduring .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	1	5	All this is evidence that God ’ s judgment is right , and as a result you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God , for which you are suffering .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	1	6	,
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	1	7	and give relief to you who are troubled , and to us as well . This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	1	8	He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	1	9	They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	1	10	on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marvelled at among all those who have believed . This includes you , because you believed our testimony to you .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	1	11	With this in mind , we constantly pray for you , that our God may make you worthy of his calling , and that by his power he may bring to fruition your every desire for goodness and your every deed prompted by faith .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	1	12	We pray this so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you , and you in him , according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ . [ c ] Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	2	3	Don ’ t let anyone deceive you in any way , for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness [ a ] is revealed , the man doomed to destruction .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	2	4	He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshipped , so that he sets himself up in God ’ s temple , proclaiming himself to be God .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	2	5	Don ’ t you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things ?
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	2	6	And now you know what is holding him back , so that he may be revealed at the proper time .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	2	7	For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work ; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	2	8	And then the lawless one will be revealed , whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendour of his coming .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	2	9	The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works . He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie ,
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	2	10	and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing . They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	2	11	For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	2	12	and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness . Stand firm
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	2	13	But we ought always to thank God for you , brothers and sisters loved by the Lord , because God chose you as firstfruits [ b ] to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	2	14	He called you to this through our gospel , that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	2	15	So then , brothers and sisters , stand firm and hold fast to the teachings [ c ] we passed on to you , whether by word of mouth or by letter .

NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	3	6	In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ , we command you , brothers and sisters , to keep away from every believer who is idle and disruptive and does not live according to the teaching [ a ] you received from us .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	3	7	For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example . We were not idle when we were with you ,
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	3	8	nor did we eat anyone ’ s food without paying for it . On the contrary , we worked night and day , labouring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	3	9	We did this , not because we do not have the right to such help , but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	3	10	For even when we were with you , we gave you this rule : ‘ The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat. ’
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	3	11	We hear that some among you are idle and disruptive . They are not busy ; they are busybodies .
NIVUK	2%20Thessalonians	3	12	Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the food they eat .

NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Saviour and of Christ Jesus our hope ,
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	2	To Timothy my true son in the faith : Grace , mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord . Timothy charged to oppose false teachers
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	3	As I urged you when I went into Macedonia , stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines any longer
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	4	or to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies . Such things promote controversial speculations rather than advancing God ’ s work – which is by faith .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	5	The goal of this command is love , which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	6	Some have departed from these and have turned to meaningless talk .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	7	They want to be teachers of the law , but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	8	We know that the law is good if one uses it properly .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	9	We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels , the ungodly and sinful , the unholy and irreligious , for those who kill their fathers or mothers , for murderers ,
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	10	for the sexually immoral , for those practising homosexuality , for slave traders and liars and perjurers – and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	11	that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed God , which he entrusted to me . The Lord ’ s grace to Paul
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	12	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who has given me strength , that he considered me trustworthy , appointing me to his service .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	13	Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man , I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	14	The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly , along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	15	Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance : Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners – of whom I am the worst .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	16	But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me , the worst of sinners , Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	17	Now to the King eternal , immortal , invisible , the only God , be honour and glory for ever and ever . Amen . The charge to Timothy renewed
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	18	Timothy , my son , I am giving you this command in keeping with the prophecies once made about you , so that by recalling them you may fight the battle well ,
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	1	19	holding on to faith and a good conscience , which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck with regard to the faith .

NIVUK	1%20Timothy	3	3	not given to drunkenness , not violent but gentle , not quarrelsome , not a lover of money .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	3	2	Now the overseer is to be above reproach , faithful to his wife , temperate , self-controlled , respectable , hospitable , able to teach ,
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	3	4	He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him , and he must do so in a manner worthy of full [ a ] respect .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	3	5	( If anyone does not know how to manage his own family , how can he take care of God ’ s church ? )
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	3	6	He must not be a recent convert , or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	3	7	He must also have a good reputation with outsiders , so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil ’ s trap .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	3	8	In the same way , deacons [ b ] are to be worthy of respect , sincere , not indulging in much wine , and not pursuing dishonest gain .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	3	9	They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	3	10	They must first be tested ; and then if there is nothing against them , let them serve as deacons .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	3	11	In the same way , the women [ c ] are to be worthy of respect , not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	3	12	; and in Romans 16:1 and Phil . 1:1 . -
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	3	13	Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus . Reasons for Paul ’ s instructions
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	3	14	Although I hope to come to you soon , I am writing to you with these instructions so that ,
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	3	15	if I am delayed , you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God ’ s household , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and foundation of the truth .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	3	16	Beyond all question , the mystery from which true godliness springs is great : He appeared in the flesh , was vindicated by the Spirit , [ d ] was seen by angels , was preached among the nations , was believed on in the world , was taken up in glory . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Timothy	4	1	Timothy 4:6 The Greek word for brothers and sisters ( adelphoi ) refers here to believers , both men and women , as part of God ’ s family . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	4	4	For everything God created is good , and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving ,
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	4	2	Such teachings come through hypocritical liars , whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	4	3	They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods , which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	4	5	because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	4	6	If you point these things out to the brothers and sisters , [ a ] you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus , nourished on the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	4	7	Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives ’ tales ; rather , train yourself to be godly .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	4	8	For physical training is of some value , but godliness has value for all things , holding promise for both the present life and the life to come .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	4	9	This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	4	10	That is why we labour and strive , because we have put our hope in the living God , who is the Saviour of all people , and especially of those who believe .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	4	11	Command and teach these things .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	4	12	Don ’ t let anyone look down on you because you are young , but set an example for the believers in speech , in conduct , in love , in faith and in purity .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	4	13	Until I come , devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture , to preaching and to teaching .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	4	14	Do not neglect your gift , which was given you through prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	4	15	Be diligent in these matters ; give yourself wholly to them , so that everyone may see your progress .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	4	16	Watch your life and doctrine closely . Persevere in them , because if you do , you will save both yourself and your hearers . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	1	Timothy 5:18 Luke 10:7 Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	5	The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	2	older women as mothers , and younger women as sisters , with absolute purity .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	3	Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	4	But if a widow has children or grandchildren , these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents , for this is pleasing to God .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	6	But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	7	Give the people these instructions , so that no one may be open to blame .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	8	Anyone who does not provide for their relatives , and especially for their own household , has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	9	No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty , has been faithful to her husband ,
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	10	and is well known for her good deeds , such as bringing up children , showing hospitality , washing the feet of the Lord ’ s people , helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	11	As for younger widows , do not put them on such a list . For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ , they want to marry .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	12	Thus they bring judgment on themselves , because they have broken their first pledge .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	13	Besides , they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house . And not only do they become idlers , but also busybodies who talk nonsense , saying things they ought not to .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	14	So I counsel younger widows to marry , to have children , to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	15	Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	16	If any woman who is a believer has widows in her care , she should continue to help them and not let the church be burdened with them , so that the church can help those widows who are really in need .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	17	The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honour , especially those whose work is preaching and teaching .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	18	For Scripture says , ‘ Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain , ’ [ a ] and ‘ The worker deserves his wages. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	19	Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	20	But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone , so that the others may take warning .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	21	I charge you , in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels , to keep these instructions without partiality , and to do nothing out of favouritism .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	22	Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands , and do not share in the sins of others . Keep yourself pure .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	23	Stop drinking only water , and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	24	The sins of some are obvious , reaching the place of judgment ahead of them ; the sins of others trail behind them .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	5	25	In the same way , good deeds are obvious , and even those that are not obvious can not remain hidden for ever . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	1	Timothy 6:2 Or and benefit from the service Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	6	But godliness with contentment is great gain .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	2	Those who have believing masters should not show them disrespect just because they are fellow believers . Instead , they should serve them even better because their masters are dear to them as fellow believers and are devoted to the welfare [ a ] of their slaves . False teachers and the love of money These are the things you are to teach and insist on .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	3	If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching ,
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	4	they are conceited and understand nothing . They have an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy , strife , malicious talk , evil suspicions
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	5	and constant friction between people of corrupt mind , who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	7	For we brought nothing into the world , and we can take nothing out of it .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	8	But if we have food and clothing , we will be content with that .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	9	Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	10	For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil . Some people , eager for money , have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs . Final charge to Timothy
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	11	But you , man of God , flee from all this , and pursue righteousness , godliness , faith , love , endurance and gentleness .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	12	Fight the good fight of the faith . Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	13	In the sight of God , who gives life to everything , and of Christ Jesus , who while testifying before Pontius Pilate made the good confession , I charge you
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	14	to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	15	which God will bring about in his own time – God , the blessed and only Ruler , the King of kings and Lord of lords ,
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	16	who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light , whom no one has seen or can see . To him be honour and might for ever . Amen .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	17	Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth , which is so uncertain , but to put their hope in God , who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	18	Command them to do good , to be rich in good deeds , and to be generous and willing to share .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	19	In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age , so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life .
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	20	Timothy , guard what has been entrusted to your care . Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge ,
NIVUK	1%20Timothy	6	21	which some have professed and in so doing have departed from the faith . Grace be with you all . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Timothy	1	2	To Timothy , my dear son : Grace , mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord . Thanksgiving
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , in keeping with the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus ,
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	1	3	I thank God , whom I serve , as my ancestors did , with a clear conscience , as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	1	4	Recalling your tears , I long to see you , so that I may be filled with joy .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	1	5	I am reminded of your sincere faith , which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and , I am persuaded , now lives in you also . Appeal for loyalty to Paul and the gospel
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	1	6	For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God , which is in you through the laying on of my hands .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	1	7	For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid , but gives us power , love and self-discipline .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	1	8	So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner . Rather , join with me in suffering for the gospel , by the power of God .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	1	9	He has saved us and called us to a holy life – not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace . This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time ,
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	1	10	but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Saviour , Christ Jesus , who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	1	11	And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	1	12	That is why I am suffering as I am . Yet this is no cause for shame , because I know whom I have believed , and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	1	13	What you heard from me , keep as the pattern of sound teaching , with faith and love in Christ Jesus .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	1	14	Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you – guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us . Examples of disloyalty and loyalty
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	1	15	You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me , including Phygelus and Hermogenes .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	1	16	May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus , because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	1	17	On the contrary , when he was in Rome , he searched hard for me until he found me .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	1	18	May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day ! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	2	And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	3	Join with me in suffering , like a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	4	No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs , but rather tries to please his commanding officer .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	5	Similarly , anyone who competes as an athlete does not receive the victor ’ s crown except by competing according to the rules .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	6	The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	7	Reflect on what I am saying , for the Lord will give you insight into all this .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	8	Remember Jesus Christ , raised from the dead , descended from David . This is my gospel ,
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	9	for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal . But God ’ s word is not chained .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	10	Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect , that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus , with eternal glory .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	11	Here is a trustworthy saying : If we died with him , we will also live with him ;
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	12	if we endure , we will also reign with him . If we disown him , he will also disown us ;
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	13	if we are faithless , he remains faithful , for he can not disown himself . Dealing with false teachers
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	14	Keep reminding God ’ s people of these things . Warn them before God against quarrelling about words ; it is of no value , and only ruins those who listen .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	15	Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved , a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	16	Avoid godless chatter , because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	17	Their teaching will spread like gangrene . Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus ,
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	18	who have departed from the truth . They say that the resurrection has already taken place , and they destroy the faith of some .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	19	Nevertheless , God ’ s solid foundation stands firm , sealed with this inscription : ‘ The Lord knows those who are his , ’ and , ‘ Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness. ’
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	20	In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver , but also of wood and clay ; some are for special purposes and some for common use .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	21	Those who cleanse themselves from the latter will be instruments for special purposes , made holy , useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	22	Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness , faith , love and peace , along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	23	Don ’ t have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments , because you know they produce quarrels .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	24	And the Lord ’ s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone , able to teach , not resentful .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	25	Opponents must be gently instructed , in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth ,
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	2	26	and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil , who has taken them captive to do his will . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	2%20Timothy	3	4	treacherous , rash , conceited , lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God –
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	3	5	having a form of godliness but denying its power . Have nothing to do with such people .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	3	6	They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over gullible women , who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires ,
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	3	7	always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	3	8	Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses , so also these teachers oppose the truth . They are men of depraved minds , who , as far as the faith is concerned , are rejected .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	3	9	But they will not get very far because , as in the case of those men , their folly will be clear to everyone . A final charge to Timothy
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	3	10	You , however , know all about my teaching , my way of life , my purpose , faith , patience , love , endurance ,
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	3	11	persecutions , sufferings – what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch , Iconium and Lystra , the persecutions I endured . Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	3	12	In fact , everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted ,
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	3	13	while evildoers and impostors will go from bad to worse , deceiving and being deceived .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	3	14	But as for you , continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of , because you know those from whom you learned it ,
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	3	15	and how from infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures , which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	3	16	All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching , rebuking , correcting and training in righteousness ,

NIVUK	2%20Timothy	4	4	They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	4	3	For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine . Instead , to suit their own desires , they will gather round them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	4	5	But you , keep your head in all situations , endure hardship , do the work of an evangelist , discharge all the duties of your ministry .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	4	6	For I am already being poured out like a drink offering , and the time for my departure is near .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	4	7	I have fought the good fight , I have finished the race , I have kept the faith .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	4	8	Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous Judge , will award to me on that day – and not only to me , but also to all who have longed for his appearing . Personal remarks
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	4	9	Do your best to come to me quickly ,
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	4	10	for Demas , because he loved this world , has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica . Crescens has gone to Galatia , and Titus to Dalmatia .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	4	11	Only Luke is with me . Get Mark and bring him with you , because he is helpful to me in my ministry .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	4	12	I sent Tychicus to Ephesus .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	4	13	When you come , bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas , and my scrolls , especially the parchments .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	4	14	Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm . The Lord will repay him for what he has done .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	4	15	You too should be on your guard against him , because he strongly opposed our message .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	4	16	At my first defence , no one came to my support , but everyone deserted me . May it not be held against them .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	4	17	But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength , so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it . And I was delivered from the lion ’ s mouth .
NIVUK	2%20Timothy	4	18	The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom . To him be glory for ever and ever . Amen . Final greetings

NIVUK	Titus	1	1	Paul , a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ to further the faith of God ’ s elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness –
NIVUK	Titus	1	2	in the hope of eternal life , which God , who does not lie , promised before the beginning of time ,
NIVUK	Titus	1	3	and which now at his appointed season he has brought to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Saviour ,
NIVUK	Titus	1	4	To Titus , my true son in our common faith : Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour . Appointing elders who love what is good
NIVUK	Titus	1	5	The reason I left you in Crete was that you might put in order what was left unfinished and appoint [ a ] elders in every town , as I directed you .
NIVUK	Titus	1	6	An elder must be blameless , faithful to his wife , a man whose children believe [ b ] and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient .
NIVUK	Titus	1	7	Since an overseer manages God ’ s household , he must be blameless – not overbearing , not quick-tempered , not given to drunkenness , not violent , not pursuing dishonest gain .
NIVUK	Titus	1	8	Rather , he must be hospitable , one who loves what is good , who is self-controlled , upright , holy and disciplined .
NIVUK	Titus	1	9	He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught , so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it . Rebuking those who fail to do good
NIVUK	Titus	1	10	For there are many rebellious people , full of meaningless talk and deception , especially those of the circumcision group .
NIVUK	Titus	1	11	They must be silenced , because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach – and that for the sake of dishonest gain .
NIVUK	Titus	1	12	One of Crete ’ s own prophets has said it : ‘ Cretans are always liars , evil brutes , lazy gluttons. ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	Titus	1	13	This saying is true . Therefore rebuke them sharply , so that they will be sound in the faith
NIVUK	Titus	1	14	and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the merely human commands of those who reject the truth .
NIVUK	Titus	1	15	To the pure , all things are pure , but to those who are corrupted and do not believe , nothing is pure . In fact , both their minds and consciences are corrupted .
NIVUK	Titus	1	16	They claim to know God , but by their actions they deny him . They are detestable , disobedient and unfit for doing anything good .

NIVUK	Titus	2	2	Teach the older men to be temperate , worthy of respect , self-controlled , and sound in faith , in love and in endurance .
NIVUK	Titus	2	3	Likewise , teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live , not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine , but to teach what is good .

NIVUK	Titus	2	5	to be self-controlled and pure , to be busy at home , to be kind , and to be subject to their husbands , so that no one will malign the word of God .
NIVUK	Titus	2	6	Similarly , encourage the young men to be self-controlled .
NIVUK	Titus	2	7	In everything set them an example by doing what is good . In your teaching show integrity , seriousness
NIVUK	Titus	2	8	and soundness of speech that can not be condemned , so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us .
NIVUK	Titus	2	9	Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything , to try to please them , not to talk back to them ,
NIVUK	Titus	2	10	and not to steal from them , but to show that they can be fully trusted , so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Saviour attractive .
NIVUK	Titus	2	11	For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people .
NIVUK	Titus	2	12	It teaches us to say ‘ No ’ to ungodliness and worldly passions , and to live self-controlled , upright and godly lives in this present age ,
NIVUK	Titus	2	13	while we wait for the blessed hope – the appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour , Jesus Christ ,
NIVUK	Titus	2	14	who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own , eager to do what is good .
NIVUK	Titus	2	15	These , then , are the things you should teach . Encourage and rebuke with all authority . Do not let anyone despise you . Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Titus	3	3	At one time we too were foolish , disobedient , deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures . We lived in malice and envy , being hated and hating one another .
NIVUK	Titus	3	2	to slander no one , to be peaceable and considerate , and always to be gentle towards everyone .
NIVUK	Titus	3	4	But when the kindness and love of God our Saviour appeared ,
NIVUK	Titus	3	5	he saved us , not because of righteous things we had done , but because of his mercy . He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit ,
NIVUK	Titus	3	6	whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Saviour ,
NIVUK	Titus	3	7	so that , having been justified by his grace , we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life .
NIVUK	Titus	3	8	This is a trustworthy saying . And I want you to stress these things , so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good . These things are excellent and profitable for everyone .
NIVUK	Titus	3	9	But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law , because these are unprofitable and useless .
NIVUK	Titus	3	10	Warn a divisive person once , and then warn them a second time . After that , have nothing to do with them .

NIVUK	Philemon	1	1	Paul , a prisoner of Christ Jesus , and Timothy our brother , To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker –
NIVUK	Philemon	1	2	also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier – and to the church that meets in your home :
NIVUK	Philemon	1	3	Grace and peace to you [ a ] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Thanksgiving and prayer
NIVUK	Philemon	1	4	I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers ,
NIVUK	Philemon	1	5	because I hear about your love for all his holy people and your faith in the Lord Jesus .
NIVUK	Philemon	1	6	I pray that your partnership with us in the faith may be effective in deepening your understanding of every good thing we share for the sake of Christ .
NIVUK	Philemon	1	7	Your love has given me great joy and encouragement , because you , brother , have refreshed the hearts of the Lord ’ s people . Paul ’ s plea for Onesimus
NIVUK	Philemon	1	8	Therefore , although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do ,
NIVUK	Philemon	1	9	yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love . It is as none other than Paul – an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus –
NIVUK	Philemon	1	10	that I appeal to you for my son Onesimus , [ b ] who became my son while I was in chains .
NIVUK	Philemon	1	11	Formerly he was useless to you , but now he has become useful both to you and to me .
NIVUK	Philemon	1	12	I am sending him – who is my very heart – back to you .
NIVUK	Philemon	1	13	I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel .
NIVUK	Philemon	1	14	But I did not want to do anything without your consent , so that any favour you do would not seem forced but would be voluntary .
NIVUK	Philemon	1	15	Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for ever –
NIVUK	Philemon	1	16	no longer as a slave , but better than a slave , as a dear brother . He is very dear to me but even dearer to you , both as a fellow man and as a brother in the Lord .
NIVUK	Philemon	1	17	So if you consider me a partner , welcome him as you would welcome me .
NIVUK	Philemon	1	18	If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything , charge it to me .
NIVUK	Philemon	1	19	I , Paul , am writing this with my own hand . I will pay it back – not to mention that you owe me your very self .
NIVUK	Philemon	1	20	I do wish , brother , that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord ; refresh my heart in Christ .
NIVUK	Philemon	1	21	Confident of your obedience , I write to you , knowing that you will do even more than I ask .
NIVUK	Philemon	1	22	and
NIVUK	Philemon	1	23	Epaphras , my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus , sends you greetings .

NIVUK	Hebrews	1	2	Samuel 7:14 ;
NIVUK	Hebrews	1	3	The Son is the radiance of God ’ s glory and the exact representation of his being , sustaining all things by his powerful word . After he had provided purification for sins , he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven .
NIVUK	Hebrews	1	4	So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs . The Son superior to angels
NIVUK	Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the angels did God ever say , ‘ You are my Son ; today I have become your Father ’ [ a ] ? Or again , ‘ I will be his Father , and he will be my Son ’ [ b ] ?
NIVUK	Hebrews	1	6	And again , when God brings his firstborn into the world , he says , ‘ Let all God ’ s angels worship him. ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	1	7	In speaking of the angels he says , ‘ He makes his angels spirits , and his servants flames of fire. ’ [ d ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	1	8	But about the Son he says , ‘ Your throne , O God , will last for ever and ever ; a sceptre of justice will be the sceptre of your kingdom .
NIVUK	Hebrews	1	9	You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness ; therefore God , your God , has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy. ’ [ e ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	1	10	He also says , ‘ In the beginning , Lord , you laid the foundations of the earth , and the heavens are the work of your hands .
NIVUK	Hebrews	1	11	They will perish , but you remain ; they will all wear out like a garment .
NIVUK	Hebrews	1	12	You will roll them up like a robe ; like a garment they will be changed . But you remain the same , and your years will never end. ’ [ f ]

NIVUK	Hebrews	2	2	For since the message spoken through angels was binding , and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	2	3	how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation ? This salvation , which was first announced by the Lord , was confirmed to us by those who heard him .
NIVUK	Hebrews	2	4	God also testified to it by signs , wonders and various miracles , and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will . Jesus made fully human
NIVUK	Hebrews	2	5	It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come , about which we are speaking .
NIVUK	Hebrews	2	6	But there is a place where someone has testified : ‘ What is mankind that you are mindful of them , a son of man that you care for him ?
NIVUK	Hebrews	2	7	You made him a little lower than the angels ; / you crowned him with glory and honour/

NIVUK	Hebrews	2	9	But we do see Jesus , who was made lower than the angels for a little while , now crowned with glory and honour because he suffered death , so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone .
NIVUK	Hebrews	2	10	In bringing many sons and daughters to glory , it was fitting that God , for whom and through whom everything exists , should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through what he suffered .
NIVUK	Hebrews	2	11	Both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family . So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters . [ g ]

NIVUK	Hebrews	2	14	Since the children have flesh and blood , he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death – that is , the devil –
NIVUK	Hebrews	2	15	and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death .
NIVUK	Hebrews	2	16	For surely it is not angels he helps , but Abraham ’ s descendants .
NIVUK	Hebrews	2	17	For this reason he had to be made like them , [ k ] fully human in every way , in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God , and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people .

NIVUK	Hebrews	3	3	Jesus has been found worthy of greater honour than Moses , just as the builder of a house has greater honour than the house itself .
NIVUK	Hebrews	3	2	He was faithful to the one who appointed him , just as Moses was faithful in all God ’ s house .
NIVUK	Hebrews	3	4	For every house is built by someone , but God is the builder of everything .
NIVUK	Hebrews	3	5	‘ Moses was faithful as a servant in all God ’ s house , ’ [ a ] bearing witness to what would be spoken by God in the future .
NIVUK	Hebrews	3	6	But Christ is faithful as the Son over God ’ s house . And we are his house , if indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we glory . Warning against unbelief
NIVUK	Hebrews	3	7	So , as the Holy Spirit says : ‘ Today , if you hear his voice ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	3	8	do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion , during the time of testing in the wilderness ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	3	9	where your ancestors tested and tried me , though for forty years they saw what I did .
NIVUK	Hebrews	3	10	That is why I was angry with that generation ; I said , “ Their hearts are always going astray , and they have not known my ways. ”
NIVUK	Hebrews	3	11	So I declared on oath in my anger , “ They shall never enter my rest. ” ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	3	12	See to it , brothers and sisters , that none of you has a sinful , unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God .
NIVUK	Hebrews	3	13	But encourage one another daily , as long as it is called ‘ Today ’ , so that none of you may be hardened by sin ’ s deceitfulness .
NIVUK	Hebrews	3	14	We have come to share in Christ , if indeed we hold our original conviction firmly to the very end .
NIVUK	Hebrews	3	15	As has just been said : ‘ Today , if you hear his voice , do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion. ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	3	16	Who were they who heard and rebelled ? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt ?
NIVUK	Hebrews	3	17	And with whom was he angry for forty years ? Was it not with those who sinned , whose bodies perished in the wilderness ?
NIVUK	Hebrews	3	18	And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed ?
NIVUK	Hebrews	3	19	So we see that they were not able to enter , because of their unbelief . Footnotes - Hebrews 3:5 Num . 12:7 - Hebrews 3:11 Psalm 95:7-11 - Hebrews 3:15 Psalm 95:7,8 Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Hebrews	4	4	For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words : ‘ On the seventh day God rested from all his works. ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	4	2	For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us , just as they did ; but the message they heard was of no value to them , because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed . [ a ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	4	3	Now we who have believed enter that rest , just as God has said , ‘ So I declared on oath in my anger , “ They shall never enter my rest. ” ’ [ b ] And yet his works have been finished since the creation of the world .

NIVUK	Hebrews	4	6	Therefore since it still remains for some to enter that rest , and since those who formerly had the good news proclaimed to them did not go in because of their disobedience ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	4	7	God again set a certain day , calling it ‘ Today ’ . This he did when a long time later he spoke through David , as in the passage already quoted : ‘ Today , if you hear his voice , do not harden your hearts. ’ [ d ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	4	8	For if Joshua had given them rest , God would not have spoken later about another day .
NIVUK	Hebrews	4	9	There remains , then , a Sabbath-rest for the people of God ;
NIVUK	Hebrews	4	10	for anyone who enters God ’ s rest also rests from their works , [ e ] just as God did from his .
NIVUK	Hebrews	4	11	Let us , therefore , make every effort to enter that rest , so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience .
NIVUK	Hebrews	4	12	For the word of God is alive and active . Sharper than any double-edged sword , it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit , joints and marrow ; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart .
NIVUK	Hebrews	4	13	Nothing in all creation is hidden from God ’ s sight . Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account . Jesus the great high priest
NIVUK	Hebrews	4	14	Therefore , since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven , [ f ] Jesus the Son of God , let us hold firmly to the faith we profess .
NIVUK	Hebrews	4	15	For we do not have a high priest who is unable to feel sympathy for our weaknesses , but we have one who has been tempted in every way , just as we are – yet he did not sin .
NIVUK	Hebrews	4	16	Let us then approach God ’ s throne of grace with confidence , so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need . Footnotes - Hebrews 4:2 Some manuscripts because those who heard did not combine it with faith - Hebrews 4:3 Psalm 95:11 ; also in verse

NIVUK	Hebrews	5	5	In the same way , Christ did not take on himself the glory of becoming a high priest . But God said to him , ‘ You are my Son ; today I have become your Father. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	5	2	He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray , since he himself is subject to weakness .
NIVUK	Hebrews	5	3	This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins , as well as for the sins of the people .
NIVUK	Hebrews	5	4	And no one takes this honour on himself , but he receives it when called by God , just as Aaron was .
NIVUK	Hebrews	5	6	And he says in another place , ‘ You are a priest for ever , in the order of Melchizedek. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	5	7	During the days of Jesus ’ life on earth , he offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries and tears to the one who could save him from death , and he was heard because of his reverent submission .
NIVUK	Hebrews	5	8	Son though he was , he learned obedience from what he suffered
NIVUK	Hebrews	5	9	and , once made perfect , he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him
NIVUK	Hebrews	5	10	and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek . Warning against falling away
NIVUK	Hebrews	5	11	We have much to say about this , but it is hard to make it clear to you because you no longer try to understand .
NIVUK	Hebrews	5	12	In fact , though by this time you ought to be teachers , you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God ’ s word all over again . You need milk , not solid food !
NIVUK	Hebrews	5	13	Anyone who lives on milk , being still an infant , is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness .
NIVUK	Hebrews	5	14	But solid food is for the mature , who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil . Footnotes - Hebrews 5:5 Psalm 2:7 - Hebrews 5:6 Psalm 110:4 Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Hebrews	6	5	who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age
NIVUK	Hebrews	6	7	Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God .
NIVUK	Hebrews	6	8	But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed . In the end it will be burned .
NIVUK	Hebrews	6	9	Even though we speak like this , dear friends , we are convinced of better things in your case – the things that have to do with salvation .
NIVUK	Hebrews	6	10	God is not unjust ; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them .
NIVUK	Hebrews	6	11	We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end , so that what you hope for may be fully realized .
NIVUK	Hebrews	6	12	We do not want you to become lazy , but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised . The certainty of God ’ s promise
NIVUK	Hebrews	6	13	When God made his promise to Abraham , since there was no one greater for him to swear by , he swore by himself ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	6	14	saying , ‘ I will surely bless you and give you many descendants. ’ [ d ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	6	15	And so after waiting patiently , Abraham received what was promised .
NIVUK	Hebrews	6	16	People swear by someone greater than themselves , and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument .
NIVUK	Hebrews	6	17	Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised , he confirmed it with an oath .
NIVUK	Hebrews	6	18	God did this so that , by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie , we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged .
NIVUK	Hebrews	6	19	We have this hope as an anchor for the soul , firm and secure . It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain ,

NIVUK	Hebrews	7	7	And without doubt the lesser is blessed by the greater .
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	2	and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything . First , the name Melchizedek means ‘ king of righteousness ’ ; then also , ‘ king of Salem ’ means ‘ king of peace ’ .
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	3	Without father or mother , without genealogy , without beginning of days or end of life , resembling the Son of God , he remains a priest for ever .
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	4	Just think how great he was : even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder !
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	5	Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people – that is , from their fellow Israelites – even though they also are descended from Abraham .
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	6	This man , however , did not trace his descent from Levi , yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises .
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	8	In the one case , the tenth is collected by people who die ; but in the other case , by him who is declared to be living .
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	9	One might even say that Levi , who collects the tenth , paid the tenth through Abraham ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	10	because when Melchizedek met Abraham , Levi was still in the body of his ancestor . Jesus like Melchizedek
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	11	If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood – and indeed the law given to the people established that priesthood – why was there still need for another priest to come , one in the order of Melchizedek , not in the order of Aaron ?
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	12	For when the priesthood is changed , the law must be changed also .
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	13	He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe , and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar .
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	14	For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah , and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests .
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	15	And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	16	one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life .
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	17	For it is declared : ‘ You are a priest for ever , in the order of Melchizedek. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	18	The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	19	( for the law made nothing perfect ) , and a better hope is introduced , by which we draw near to God .
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	20	And it was not without an oath ! Others became priests without any oath ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	21	but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him : ‘ The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind : “ You are a priest for ever. ” ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	22	Because of this oath , Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant .
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	23	Now there have been many of those priests , since death prevented them from continuing in office ;
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	24	but because Jesus lives for ever , he has a permanent priesthood .
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	25	Therefore he is able to save completely [ c ] those who come to God through him , because he always lives to intercede for them .
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	26	Such a high priest truly meets our need – one who is holy , blameless , pure , set apart from sinners , exalted above the heavens .
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	27	Unlike the other high priests , he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day , first for his own sins , and then for the sins of the people . He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself .
NIVUK	Hebrews	7	28	For the law appoints as high priests men in all their weakness ; but the oath , which came after the law , appointed the Son , who has been made perfect for ever .

NIVUK	Hebrews	8	8	But God found fault with the people and said [ b ] : ‘ The days are coming , declares the Lord , when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah .
NIVUK	Hebrews	8	2	and who serves in the sanctuary , the true tabernacle set up by the Lord , not by a mere human being .
NIVUK	Hebrews	8	3	Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices , and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer .
NIVUK	Hebrews	8	4	If he were on earth , he would not be a priest , for there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law .
NIVUK	Hebrews	8	5	They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven . This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle : ‘ See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	8	6	But in fact the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one , since the new covenant is established on better promises .
NIVUK	Hebrews	8	7	For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant , no place would have been sought for another .
NIVUK	Hebrews	8	9	It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt , because they did not remain faithful to my covenant , and I turned away from them , declares the Lord .
NIVUK	Hebrews	8	10	This is the covenant I will establish with the people of Israel after that time , declares the Lord . I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
NIVUK	Hebrews	8	11	No longer will they teach their neighbours , or say to one another , “ Know the Lord , ” because they will all know me , from the least of them to the greatest .
NIVUK	Hebrews	8	12	For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more. ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	8	13	By calling this covenant ‘ new ’ , he has made the first one obsolete ; and what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear .

NIVUK	Hebrews	9	9	This is an illustration for the present time , indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshipper .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	2	A tabernacle was set up . In its first room were the lampstand and the table with its consecrated bread ; this was called the Holy Place .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	3	Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	4	which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant . This ark contained the gold jar of manna , Aaron ’ s staff that had budded , and the stone tablets of the covenant .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	5	Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory , overshadowing the atonement cover . But we can not discuss these things in detail now .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	6	When everything had been arranged like this , the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	7	But only the high priest entered the inner room , and that only once a year , and never without blood , which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	8	The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still functioning .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	10	They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings – external regulations applying until the time of the new order . The blood of Christ
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	11	But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here , [ a ] he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made with human hands , that is to say , is not a part of this creation .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	12	He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves ; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood , so obtaining [ b ] eternal redemption .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	13	The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	14	How much more , then , will the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God , cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death , [ c ] so that we may serve the living God !
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	15	For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant , that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance – now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	16	In the case of a will , [ d ] it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	17	- Hebrews 9:20 Exodus 24:8 Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	18	This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	19	When Moses had proclaimed every command of the law to all the people , he took the blood of calves , together with water , scarlet wool and branches of hyssop , and sprinkled the scroll and all the people .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	20	He said , ‘ This is the blood of the covenant , which God has commanded you to keep. ’ [ e ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	21	In the same way , he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	22	In fact , the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood , and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	23	It was necessary , then , for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices , but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	24	For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands that was only a copy of the true one ; he entered heaven itself , now to appear for us in God ’ s presence .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	25	Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again , the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	26	Otherwise Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world . But he has appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself .
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	27	Just as people are destined to die once , and after that to face judgment ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	9	28	so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many ; and he will appear a second time , not to bear sin , but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him . Footnotes - Hebrews 9:11 Some early manuscripts are to come - Hebrews 9:12 Or blood , having obtained - Hebrews 9:14 Or from useless rituals - Hebrews 9:16 Same Greek word as covenant ; also in verse

NIVUK	Hebrews	10	10	And by that will , we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	2	Otherwise , would they not have stopped being offered ? For the worshippers would have been cleansed once for all , and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	3	But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	4	It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	5	Therefore , when Christ came into the world , he said : ‘ Sacrifice and offering you did not desire , but a body you prepared for me ;
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	6	with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	7	Then I said , “ Here I am – it is written about me in the scroll – I have come to do your will , my God. ” ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	8	First he said , ‘ Sacrifices and offerings , burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire , nor were you pleased with them ’ – though they were offered in accordance with the law .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	9	Then he said , ‘ Here I am , I have come to do your will. ’ He sets aside the first to establish the second .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	11	Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties ; again and again he offers the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	12	But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins , he sat down at the right hand of God ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	13	and since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	14	For by one sacrifice he has made perfect for ever those who are being made holy .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	15	The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this . First he says :
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	16	‘ This is the covenant I will make with them after that time , says the Lord . I will put my laws in their hearts , and I will write them on their minds. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	17	Then he adds : ‘ Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more. ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	18	And where these have been forgiven , sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary . A call to persevere in faith
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	19	Therefore , brothers and sisters , since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	20	by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain , that is , his body ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	21	and since we have a great priest over the house of God ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	22	let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings , having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	23	Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess , for he who promised is faithful .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	24	And let us consider how we may spur one another on towards love and good deeds ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	25	not giving up meeting together , as some are in the habit of doing , but encouraging one another – and all the more as you see the Day approaching .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	26	If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth , no sacrifice for sins is left ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	27	but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	28	Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	29	How much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot , who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them , and who has insulted the Spirit of grace ?
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	30	For we know him who said , ‘ It is mine to avenge ; I will repay , ’ [ d ] and again , ‘ The Lord will judge his people. ’ [ e ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	31	It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	32	Remember those earlier days after you had received the light , when you endured in a great conflict full of suffering .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	33	Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution ; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	34	You suffered along with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property , because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	35	So do not throw away your confidence ; it will be richly rewarded .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	36	You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God , you will receive what he has promised .
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	37	For , ‘ In just a little while , he who is coming will come and will not delay. ’ [ f ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	38	And , ‘ But my righteous [ g ] one will live by faith . And I take no pleasure in the one who shrinks back. ’ [ h ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	10	39	But we do not belong to those who shrink back and are destroyed , but to those who have faith and are saved .

NIVUK	Hebrews	11	11	And by faith even Sarah , who was past childbearing age , was enabled to bear children because she [ b ] considered him faithful who had made the promise .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	2	This is what the ancients were commended for .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	3	By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God ’ s command , so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	4	By faith Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did . By faith he was commended as righteous , when God spoke well of his offerings . And by faith Abel still speaks , even though he is dead .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	5	By faith Enoch was taken from this life , so that he did not experience death : ‘ He could not be found , because God had taken him away. ’ [ a ] For before he was taken , he was commended as one who pleased God .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	6	And without faith it is impossible to please God , because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	7	By faith Noah , when warned about things not yet seen , in holy fear built an ark to save his family . By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that is in keeping with faith .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	8	By faith Abraham , when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance , obeyed and went , even though he did not know where he was going .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	9	By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country ; he lived in tents , as did Isaac and Jacob , who were heirs with him of the same promise .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	10	For he was looking forward to the city with foundations , whose architect and builder is God .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	12	And so from this one man , and he as good as dead , came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	13	All these people were still living by faith when they died . They did not receive the things promised ; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance , admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	14	People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	15	If they had been thinking of the country they had left , they would have had opportunity to return .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	16	Instead , they were longing for a better country – a heavenly one . Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God , for he has prepared a city for them .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham , when God tested him , offered Isaac as a sacrifice . He who had embraced the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	18	even though God had said to him , ‘ It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned. ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	19	Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead , and so in a manner of speaking he did receive Isaac back from death .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	21	By faith Jacob , when he was dying , blessed each of Joseph ’ s sons , and worshipped as he leaned on the top of his staff .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	22	By faith Joseph , when his end was near , spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions concerning the burial of his bones .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	23	By faith Moses ’ parents hid him for three months after he was born , because they saw he was no ordinary child , and they were not afraid of the king ’ s edict .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	24	By faith Moses , when he had grown up , refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh ’ s daughter .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	25	He chose to be ill-treated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	26	He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt , because he was looking ahead to his reward .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	27	By faith he left Egypt , not fearing the king ’ s anger ; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	28	By faith he kept the Passover and the application of blood , so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	29	By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land ; but when the Egyptians tried to do so , they were drowned .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell , after the army had marched round them for seven days .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	31	By faith the prostitute Rahab , because she welcomed the spies , was not killed with those who were disobedient . [ d ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	32	And what more shall I say ? I do not have time to tell about Gideon , Barak , Samson and Jephthah , about David and Samuel and the prophets ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	33	who through faith conquered kingdoms , administered justice , and gained what was promised ; who shut the mouths of lions ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	34	quenched the fury of the flames , and escaped the edge of the sword ; whose weakness was turned to strength ; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	35	Women received back their dead , raised to life again . There were others who were tortured , refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better resurrection .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	36	Some faced jeers and flogging , and even chains and imprisonment .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	37	They were put to death by stoning ; [ e ] they were sawn in two ; they were killed by the sword . They went about in sheepskins and goatskins , destitute , persecuted and ill-treated –
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	38	the world was not worthy of them . They wandered in deserts and mountains , living in caves and in holes in the ground .
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	39	These were all commended for their faith , yet none of them received what had been promised ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	11	40	since God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect .

NIVUK	Hebrews	12	12	Therefore , strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees .
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	2	fixing our eyes on Jesus , the pioneer and perfecter of faith . For the joy that was set before him he endured the cross , scorning its shame , and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God .
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	3	Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners , so that you will not grow weary and lose heart . God disciplines his children
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	4	In your struggle against sin , you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood .
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	5	And have you completely forgotten this word of encouragement that addresses you as a father addresses his son ? It says , ‘ My son , do not make light of the Lord ’ s discipline , and do not lose heart when he rebukes you ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	6	because the Lord disciplines the one he loves , and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	7	Endure hardship as discipline ; God is treating you as his children . For what children are not disciplined by their father ?
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	8	If you are not disciplined – and everyone undergoes discipline – then you are not legitimate , not true sons and daughters at all .
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	9	Moreover , we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it . How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live !
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	10	They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best ; but God disciplines us for our good , in order that we may share in his holiness .
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	11	No discipline seems pleasant at the time , but painful . Later on , however , it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it .
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	13	‘ Make level paths for your feet , ’ [ b ] so that the lame may not be disabled , but rather healed . Warning and encouragement
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	14	Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy ; without holiness no one will see the Lord .
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	15	See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many .
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	16	See that no one is sexually immoral , or is godless like Esau , who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son .
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	17	Afterwards , as you know , when he wanted to inherit this blessing , he was rejected . Even though he sought the blessing with tears , he could not change what he had done . The mountain of fear and the mountain of joy
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	18	You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire ; to darkness , gloom and storm ;
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	19	to a trumpet blast or to such a voice speaking words that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	20	because they could not bear what was commanded : ‘ If even an animal touches the mountain , it must be stoned to death. ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	21	The sight was so terrifying that Moses said , ‘ I am trembling with fear. ’ [ d ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	22	But you have come to Mount Zion , to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem . You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	23	to the church of the firstborn , whose names are written in heaven . You have come to God , the Judge of all , to the spirits of the righteous made perfect ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	24	to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant , and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel .
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	25	See to it that you do not refuse him who speaks . If they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth , how much less will we , if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven ?
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	26	At that time his voice shook the earth , but now he has promised , ‘ Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens. ’ [ e ]
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	27	The words ‘ once more ’ indicate the removing of what can be shaken – that is , created things – so that what can not be shaken may remain .
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	28	Therefore , since we are receiving a kingdom that can not be shaken , let us be thankful , and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	12	29	for our ‘ God is a consuming fire. ’ [ f ] Footnotes - Hebrews 12:6 Prov . 3:11,12 ( see Septuagint ) - Hebrews 12:13 Prov . 4:26 - Hebrews 12:20 Exodus 19:12,13 - Hebrews 12:21 See Deut . 9:19 . - Hebrews 12:26 Haggai 2:6 - Hebrews 12:29 Deut . 4:24 Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	Hebrews	13	2	Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers , for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it .
NIVUK	Hebrews	13	3	Continue to remember those in prison as if you were together with them in prison , and those who are ill-treated as if you yourselves were suffering .
NIVUK	Hebrews	13	4	Marriage should be honoured by all , and the marriage bed kept pure , for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral .
NIVUK	Hebrews	13	5	Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have , because God has said , ‘ Never will I leave you ; never will I forsake you. ’ [ a ]

NIVUK	Hebrews	13	7	Remember your leaders , who spoke the word of God to you . Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith .
NIVUK	Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever .
NIVUK	Hebrews	13	9	Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings . It is good for our hearts to be strengthened by grace , not by eating ceremonial foods , which is of no benefit to those who do so .
NIVUK	Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar from which those who minister at the tabernacle have no right to eat .
NIVUK	Hebrews	13	11	The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin offering , but the bodies are burned outside the camp .
NIVUK	Hebrews	13	12	And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood .
NIVUK	Hebrews	13	14	For here we do not have an enduring city , but we are looking for the city that is to come .
NIVUK	Hebrews	13	15	Through Jesus , therefore , let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise – the fruit of lips that openly profess his name .
NIVUK	Hebrews	13	16	And do not forget to do good and to share with others , for with such sacrifices God is pleased .
NIVUK	Hebrews	13	17	Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority , because they keep watch over you as those who must give an account . Do this so that their work will be a joy , not a burden , for that would be of no benefit to you .
NIVUK	Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us . We are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honourably in every way .
NIVUK	Hebrews	13	19	I particularly urge you to pray so that I may be restored to you soon . Benediction and final greetings
NIVUK	Hebrews	13	20	Now may the God of peace , who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus , that great Shepherd of the sheep ,
NIVUK	Hebrews	13	21	equip you with everything good for doing his will , and may he work in us what is pleasing to him , through Jesus Christ , to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
NIVUK	Hebrews	13	22	Brothers and sisters , I urge you to bear with my word of exhortation , for in fact I have written to you quite briefly .
NIVUK	Hebrews	13	23	I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released . If he arrives soon , I will come with him to see you .

NIVUK	James	1	25	But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom and continues in it – not forgetting what they have heard but doing it – they will be blessed in what they do .
NIVUK	James	1	26	Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves , and their religion is worthless .
NIVUK	James	1	27	Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this : to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world .

NIVUK	James	2	2	Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes , and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in .
NIVUK	James	2	3	If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say , ‘ Here ’ s a good seat for you , ’ but say to the poor man , ‘ You stand there ’ or ‘ Sit on the floor by my feet , ’
NIVUK	James	2	4	have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts ?
NIVUK	James	2	5	Listen , my dear brothers and sisters : has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him ?
NIVUK	James	2	6	But you have dishonoured the poor . Is it not the rich who are exploiting you ? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court ?
NIVUK	James	2	7	Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of him to whom you belong ?
NIVUK	James	2	8	If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture , ‘ Love your neighbour as yourself , ’ [ a ] you are doing right .
NIVUK	James	2	9	But if you show favouritism , you sin and are convicted by the law as law-breakers .
NIVUK	James	2	10	For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it .
NIVUK	James	2	11	For he who said , ‘ You shall not commit adultery , ’ [ b ] also said , ‘ You shall not murder. ’ [ c ] If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder , you have become a law-breaker .
NIVUK	James	2	12	Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom ,
NIVUK	James	2	13	because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful . Mercy triumphs over judgment . Faith and deeds
NIVUK	James	2	14	What good is it , my brothers and sisters , if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds ? Can such faith save them ?
NIVUK	James	2	15	Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food .
NIVUK	James	2	16	If one of you says to them , ‘ Go in peace ; keep warm and well fed , ’ but does nothing about their physical needs , what good is it ?
NIVUK	James	2	17	In the same way , faith by itself , if it is not accompanied by action , is dead .
NIVUK	James	2	18	But someone will say , ‘ You have faith ; I have deeds. ’ Show me your faith without deeds , and I will show you my faith by my deeds .
NIVUK	James	2	19	You believe that there is one God . Good ! Even the demons believe that – and shudder .
NIVUK	James	2	20	You foolish person , do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless [ d ] ?
NIVUK	James	2	21	Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar ?
NIVUK	James	2	22	You see that his faith and his actions were working together , and his faith was made complete by what he did .
NIVUK	James	2	23	And the scripture was fulfilled that says , ‘ Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness , ’ [ e ] and he was called God ’ s friend .
NIVUK	James	2	24	You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone .
NIVUK	James	2	25	In the same way , was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction ?
NIVUK	James	2	26	As the body without the spirit is dead , so faith without deeds is dead .

NIVUK	James	3	3	When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us , we can turn the whole animal .
NIVUK	James	3	2	We all stumble in many ways . Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect , able to keep their whole body in check .
NIVUK	James	3	4	Or take ships as an example . Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds , they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go .
NIVUK	James	3	5	Likewise , the tongue is a small part of the body , but it makes great boasts . Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark .
NIVUK	James	3	6	The tongue also is a fire , a world of evil among the parts of the body . It corrupts the whole body , sets the whole course of one ’ s life on fire , and is itself set on fire by hell .
NIVUK	James	3	7	All kinds of animals , birds , reptiles and sea creatures are being tamed and have been tamed by mankind ,
NIVUK	James	3	8	but no human being can tame the tongue . It is a restless evil , full of deadly poison .
NIVUK	James	3	9	With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father , and with it we curse human beings , who have been made in God ’ s likeness .
NIVUK	James	3	10	Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing . My brothers and sisters , this should not be .
NIVUK	James	3	11	Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring ?
NIVUK	James	3	12	My brothers and sisters , can a fig-tree bear olives , or a grapevine bear figs ? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water . Two kinds of wisdom
NIVUK	James	3	13	Who is wise and understanding among you ? Let them show it by their good life , by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom .
NIVUK	James	3	14	But if you harbour bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts , do not boast about it or deny the truth .
NIVUK	James	3	15	Such ‘ wisdom ’ does not come down from heaven but is earthly , unspiritual , demonic .
NIVUK	James	3	16	For where you have envy and selfish ambition , there you find disorder and every evil practice .
NIVUK	James	3	17	But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure ; then peace-loving , considerate , submissive , full of mercy and good fruit , impartial and sincere .

NIVUK	James	4	4	You adulterous people , [ a ] don ’ t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God ? Therefore , anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God .
NIVUK	James	4	2	You desire but do not have , so you kill . You covet but you can not get what you want , so you quarrel and fight . You do not have because you do not ask God .
NIVUK	James	4	3	When you ask , you do not receive , because you ask with wrong motives , that you may spend what you get on your pleasures .
NIVUK	James	4	5	Or do you think Scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the spirit he has caused to dwell in us [ b ] ?
NIVUK	James	4	6	But he gives us more grace . That is why Scripture says : ‘ God opposes the proud but shows favour to the humble. ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	James	4	7	Submit yourselves , then , to God . Resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
NIVUK	James	4	8	Come near to God and he will come near to you . Wash your hands , you sinners , and purify your hearts , you double-minded .
NIVUK	James	4	9	Grieve , mourn and wail . Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom .
NIVUK	James	4	10	Humble yourselves before the Lord , and he will lift you up .
NIVUK	James	4	11	Brothers and sisters , do not slander one another . Anyone who speaks against a brother or sister [ d ] or judges them speaks against the law and judges it . When you judge the law , you are not keeping it , but sitting in judgment on it .
NIVUK	James	4	12	There is only one Lawgiver and Judge , the one who is able to save and destroy . But you – who are you to judge your neighbour ? Boasting about tomorrow
NIVUK	James	4	13	Now listen , you who say , ‘ Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city , spend a year there , carry on business and make money. ’
NIVUK	James	4	14	Why , you do not even know what will happen tomorrow . What is your life ? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes .
NIVUK	James	4	15	Instead , you ought to say , ‘ If it is the Lord ’ s will , we will live and do this or that. ’
NIVUK	James	4	16	As it is , you boast in your arrogant schemes . All such boasting is evil .
NIVUK	James	4	17	If anyone , then , knows the good they ought to do and doesn ’ t do it , it is sin for them .

NIVUK	James	5	5	You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence . You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter . [ a ]
NIVUK	James	5	2	Your wealth has rotted , and moths have eaten your clothes .
NIVUK	James	5	3	Your gold and silver are corroded . Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire . You have hoarded wealth in the last days .
NIVUK	James	5	4	Look ! The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you . The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty .
NIVUK	James	5	6	You have condemned and murdered the innocent one , who was not opposing you . Patience in suffering
NIVUK	James	5	7	Be patient , then , brothers and sisters , until the Lord ’ s coming . See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop , patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains .
NIVUK	James	5	8	You too , be patient and stand firm , because the Lord ’ s coming is near .
NIVUK	James	5	9	Don ’ t grumble against one another , brothers and sisters , or you will be judged . The Judge is standing at the door !
NIVUK	James	5	10	Brothers and sisters , as an example of patience in the face of suffering , take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
NIVUK	James	5	11	As you know , we count as blessed those who have persevered . You have heard of Job ’ s perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about . The Lord is full of compassion and mercy .
NIVUK	James	5	12	Above all , my brothers and sisters , do not swear – not by heaven or by earth or by anything else . All you need to say is a simple ‘ Yes ’ or ‘ No ’ . Otherwise you will be condemned . The prayer of faith
NIVUK	James	5	13	Is anyone among you in trouble ? Let them pray . Is anyone happy ? Let them sing songs of praise .
NIVUK	James	5	14	Is anyone among you ill ? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord .
NIVUK	James	5	15	And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well ; the Lord will raise them up . If they have sinned , they will be forgiven .
NIVUK	James	5	16	Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed . The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective .
NIVUK	James	5	17	Elijah was a human being , even as we are . He prayed earnestly that it would not rain , and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years .
NIVUK	James	5	18	Again he prayed , and the heavens gave rain , and the earth produced its crops .
NIVUK	James	5	19	My brothers and sisters , if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back ,
NIVUK	James	5	20	remember this : whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins . Footnotes - James 5:5 Or yourselves as in a day of feasting Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©

NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	2	who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , through the sanctifying work of the Spirit , to be obedient to Jesus Christ and sprinkled with his blood : Grace and peace be yours in abundance . Praise to God for a living hope
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	3	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	4	and into an inheritance that can never perish , spoil or fade . This inheritance is kept in heaven for you ,
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	5	who through faith are shielded by God ’ s power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	6	In all this you greatly rejoice , though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	7	These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith – of greater worth than gold , which perishes even though refined by fire – may result in praise , glory and honour when Jesus Christ is revealed .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	8	Though you have not seen him , you love him ; and even though you do not see him now , you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy ,
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	9	for you are receiving the end result of your faith , the salvation of your souls .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	10	Concerning this salvation , the prophets , who spoke of the grace that was to come to you , searched intently and with the greatest care ,
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	11	trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of the Messiah and the glories that would follow .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	12	It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you , when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven . Even angels long to look into these things . Be holy
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	13	Therefore , with minds that are alert and fully sober , set your hope on the grace to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed at his coming .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	14	As obedient children , do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	15	But just as he who called you is holy , so be holy in all you do ;
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	16	for it is written : ‘ Be holy , because I am holy. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	17	Since you call on a Father who judges each person ’ s work impartially , live out your time as foreigners here in reverent fear .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	18	For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors ,
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	19	but with the precious blood of Christ , a lamb without blemish or defect .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	20	He was chosen before the creation of the world , but was revealed in these last times for your sake .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	21	Through him you believe in God , who raised him from the dead and glorified him , and so your faith and hope are in God .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	22	Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for each other , love one another deeply , from the heart . [ b ]
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	23	For you have been born again , not of perishable seed , but of imperishable , through the living and enduring word of God .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	24	For , ‘ All people are like grass , and all their glory is like the flowers of the field ; the grass withers and the flowers fall ,
NIVUK	1%20Peter	1	25	but the word of the Lord endures for ever. ’ [ c ] And this is the word that was preached to you . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	3	now that you have tasted that the Lord is good . The living Stone and a chosen people
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	4	As you come to him , the living Stone – rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him –
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	5	you also , like living stones , are being built into a spiritual house [ a ] to be a holy priesthood , offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	6	For in Scripture it says : ‘ See , I lay a stone in Zion , a chosen and precious cornerstone , and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	7	Now to you who believe , this stone is precious . But to those who do not believe , ‘ The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone , ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	8	and , ‘ A stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall. ’ [ d ] They stumble because they disobey the message – which is also what they were destined for .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	9	But you are a chosen people , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , God ’ s special possession , that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	10	Once you were not a people , but now you are the people of God ; once you had not received mercy , but now you have received mercy . Living godly lives in a pagan society
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	11	Dear friends , I urge you , as foreigners and exiles , to abstain from sinful desires , which wage war against your soul .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	12	Live such good lives among the pagans that , though they accuse you of doing wrong , they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	13	Submit yourselves for the Lord ’ s sake to every human authority : whether to the emperor , as the supreme authority ,
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	14	or to governors , who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	15	For it is God ’ s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	16	Live as free people , but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil ; live as God ’ s slaves .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	17	Show proper respect to everyone , love the family of believers , fear God , honour the emperor .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	18	Slaves , in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters , not only to those who are good and considerate , but also to those who are harsh .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	19	For it is commendable if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	20	But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it ? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it , this is commendable before God .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	21	To this you were called , because Christ suffered for you , leaving you an example , that you should follow in his steps .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	22	‘ He committed no sin , and no deceit was found in his mouth. ’ [ e ]
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	23	When they hurled their insults at him , he did not retaliate ; when he suffered , he made no threats . Instead , he entrusted himself to him who judges justly .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	24	‘ He himself bore our sins ’ in his body on the cross , so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness ; ‘ by his wounds you have been healed. ’
NIVUK	1%20Peter	2	25	For ‘ you were like sheep going astray , ’ [ f ] but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	1	Peter 3:21 Or but an appeal to God for a clear conscience Holy Bible , New International Version® Anglicized , NIV® Copyright ©
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	3	Your beauty should not come from outward adornment , such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewellery or fine clothes .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	2	when they see the purity and reverence of your lives .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	4	Rather , it should be that of your inner self , the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit , which is of great worth in God ’ s sight .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	5	For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves . They submitted themselves to their own husbands ,
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	6	like Sarah , who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord . You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	7	Husbands , in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives , and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life , so that nothing will hinder your prayers . Suffering for doing good
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	8	Finally , all of you , be like-minded , be sympathetic , love one another , be compassionate and humble .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	9	Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult . On the contrary , repay evil with blessing , because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	10	For , ‘ Whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from deceitful speech .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	11	They must turn from evil and do good ; they must seek peace and pursue it .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	12	For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer , but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	13	Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good ?
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	14	But even if you should suffer for what is right , you are blessed . ‘ Do not fear their threats [ b ] ; do not be frightened. ’ [ c ]
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	15	But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord . Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have . But do this with gentleness and respect ,
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	16	keeping a clear conscience , so that those who speak maliciously against your good behaviour in Christ may be ashamed of their slander .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	17	For it is better , if it is God ’ s will , to suffer for doing good than for doing evil .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	18	For Christ also suffered once for sins , the righteous for the unrighteous , to bring you to God . He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	19	in which also -
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	20	to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built . In it only a few people , eight in all , were saved through water ,
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	21	and this water symbolises baptism that now saves you also – not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience towards God . [ e ] It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ ,
NIVUK	1%20Peter	3	22	who has gone into heaven and is at God ’ s right hand – with angels , authorities and powers in submission to him . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Peter	4	4	They are surprised that you do not join them in their reckless , wild living , and they heap abuse on you .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	4	2	As a result , they do not live the rest of their earthly lives for evil human desires , but rather for the will of God .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	4	3	For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do – living in debauchery , lust , drunkenness , orgies , carousing and detestable idolatry .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	4	5	But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	4	6	For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead , so that they might be judged according to human standards in regard to the body , but live according to God in regard to the spirit .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	4	7	The end of all things is near . Therefore be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	4	8	Above all , love each other deeply , because love covers over a multitude of sins .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	4	9	Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	4	10	Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others , as faithful stewards of God ’ s grace in its various forms .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	4	11	If anyone speaks , they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God . If anyone serves , they should do so with the strength God provides , so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ . To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever . Amen . Suffering for being a Christian
NIVUK	1%20Peter	4	12	Dear friends , do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you , as though something strange were happening to you .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	4	13	But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ , so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	4	14	If you are insulted because of the name of Christ , you are blessed , for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	4	15	If you suffer , it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal , or even as a meddler .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	4	16	However , if you suffer as a Christian , do not be ashamed , but praise God that you bear that name .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	4	17	For it is time for judgment to begin with God ’ s household ; and if it begins with us , what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God ?
NIVUK	1%20Peter	4	18	And , ‘ If it is hard for the righteous to be saved , what will become of the ungodly and the sinner ? ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	1%20Peter	4	19	So then , those who suffer according to God ’ s will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20Peter	5	5	In the same way , you who are younger , submit yourselves to your elders . All of you , clothe yourselves with humility towards one another , because , ‘ God opposes the proud but shows favour to the humble. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	1%20Peter	5	2	be shepherds of God ’ s flock that is under your care , watching over them – not because you must , but because you are willing , as God wants you to be ; not pursuing dishonest gain , but eager to serve ;
NIVUK	1%20Peter	5	3	not lording it over those entrusted to you , but being examples to the flock .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	5	4	And when the Chief Shepherd appears , you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	5	6	Humble yourselves , therefore , under God ’ s mighty hand , that he may lift you up in due time .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	5	7	Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	5	8	Be alert and of sober mind . Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	5	9	Resist him , standing firm in the faith , because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	5	10	And the God of all grace , who called you to his eternal glory in Christ , after you have suffered a little while , will himself restore you and make you strong , firm and steadfast .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	5	11	To him be the power for ever and ever . Amen . Final greetings
NIVUK	1%20Peter	5	12	With the help of Silas , [ b ] whom I regard as a faithful brother , I have written to you briefly , encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God . Stand fast in it .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	5	13	She who is in Babylon , chosen together with you , sends you her greetings , and so does my son Mark .
NIVUK	1%20Peter	5	14	Greet one another with a kiss of love . Peace to all of you who are in Christ . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	1	Simon Peter , a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ , To those who through the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours :
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	3	His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	4	Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises , so that through them you may participate in the divine nature , having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	5	For this very reason , make every effort to add to your faith goodness ; and to goodness , knowledge ;
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	6	and to knowledge , self-control ; and to self-control , perseverance ; and to perseverance , godliness ;
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	7	and to godliness , mutual affection ; and to mutual affection , love .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	8	For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure , they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	9	But whoever does not have them is short-sighted and blind , forgetting that they have been cleansed from their past sins .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	10	Therefore , my brothers and sisters , [ a ] make every effort to confirm your calling and election . For if you do these things , you will never stumble ,
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	11	and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . Prophecy of Scripture
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	12	So I will always remind you of these things , even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	13	I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body ,
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	14	because I know that I will soon put it aside , as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	15	And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	16	For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power , but we were eye-witnesses of his majesty .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	17	He received honour and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory , saying , ‘ This is my Son , whom I love ; with him I am well pleased. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	18	We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	19	We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable , and you will do well to pay attention to it , as to a light shining in a dark place , until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	20	Above all , you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet ’ s own interpretation of things .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	1	21	For prophecy never had its origin in the human will , but prophets , though human , spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit . Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	3	In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories . Their condemnation has long been hanging over them , and their destruction has not been sleeping .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	4	For if God did not spare angels when they sinned , but sent them to hell , [ a ] putting them in chains of darkness [ b ] to be held for judgment ;
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	5	if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people , but protected Noah , a preacher of righteousness , and seven others ;
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	6	if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes , and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly ;
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	7	and if he rescued Lot , a righteous man , who was distressed by the depraved conduct of the lawless
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	8	( for that righteous man , living among them day after day , was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard ) –
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	9	if this is so , then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	10	This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the flesh [ c ] and despise authority . Bold and arrogant , they are not afraid to heap abuse on celestial beings ;
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	11	yet even angels , although they are stronger and more powerful , do not heap abuse on such beings when bringing judgment on them from [ d ] the Lord .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	12	But these people blaspheme in matters they do not understand . They are like unreasoning animals , creatures of instinct , born only to be caught and destroyed , and like animals they too will perish .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	13	They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done . Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight . They are blots and blemishes , revelling in their pleasures while they feast with you . [ e ]
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	14	With eyes full of adultery , they never stop sinning ; they seduce the unstable ; they are experts in greed – an accursed brood !
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	15	They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Bezer , [ f ] who loved the wages of wickedness .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	16	But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey – an animal without speech – who spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet ’ s madness .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	17	These people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm . Blackest darkness is reserved for them .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	18	. -
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	19	They promise them freedom , while they themselves are slaves of depravity – for ‘ people are slaves to whatever has mastered them. ’
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	20	If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome , they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	21	It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	2	22	Of them the proverbs are true : ‘ A dog returns to its vomit , ’ [ g ] and , ‘ A sow that is washed returns to her wallowing in the mud. ’ Footnotes -

NIVUK	2%20Peter	3	3	Above all , you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come , scoffing and following their own evil desires .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	3	4	They will say , ‘ Where is this “ coming ” he promised ? Ever since our ancestors died , everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation. ’
NIVUK	2%20Peter	3	5	But they deliberately forget that long ago by God ’ s word the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	3	6	By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	3	7	By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire , being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	3	8	But do not forget this one thing , dear friends : with the Lord a day is like a thousand years , and a thousand years are like a day .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	3	9	The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise , as some understand slowness . Instead he is patient with you , not wanting anyone to perish , but everyone to come to repentance .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	3	10	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief . The heavens will disappear with a roar ; the elements will be destroyed by fire , and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare . [ a ]
NIVUK	2%20Peter	3	11	Since everything will be destroyed in this way , what kind of people ought you to be ? You ought to live holy and godly lives
NIVUK	2%20Peter	3	12	as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming . [ b ] That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire , and the elements will melt in the heat .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	3	13	But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth , where righteousness dwells .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	3	14	So then , dear friends , since you are looking forward to this , make every effort to be found spotless , blameless and at peace with him .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	3	15	Bear in mind that our Lord ’ s patience means salvation , just as our dear brother Paul also wrote to you with the wisdom that God gave him .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	3	16	He writes the same way in all his letters , speaking in them of these matters . His letters contain some things that are hard to understand , which ignorant and unstable people distort , as they do the other Scriptures , to their own destruction .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	3	17	Therefore , dear friends , since you have been forewarned , be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure position .
NIVUK	2%20Peter	3	18	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . To him be glory both now and for ever ! Amen . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20John	1	5	This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you : God is light ; in him there is no darkness at all .
NIVUK	1%20John	1	6	If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness , we lie and do not live out the truth .
NIVUK	1%20John	1	7	But if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus , his Son , purifies us from all [ b ] sin .

NIVUK	1%20John	2	2	He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins , and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world . Love and hatred for fellow believers
NIVUK	1%20John	2	3	We know that we have come to know him if we keep his commands .
NIVUK	1%20John	2	4	Whoever says , ‘ I know him , ’ but does not do what he commands is a liar , and the truth is not in that person .
NIVUK	1%20John	2	5	But if anyone obeys his word , love for God [ a ] is truly made complete in them . This is how we know we are in him :
NIVUK	1%20John	2	6	whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did .
NIVUK	1%20John	2	7	Dear friends , I am not writing you a new command but an old one , which you have had since the beginning . This old command is the message you have heard .
NIVUK	1%20John	2	8	Yet I am writing you a new command ; its truth is seen in him and in you , because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining .
NIVUK	1%20John	2	9	Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister [ b ] is still in the darkness .
NIVUK	1%20John	2	10	Anyone who loves their brother and sister [ c ] lives in the light , and there is nothing in them to make them stumble .

NIVUK	1%20John	2	15	Do not love the world or anything in the world . If anyone loves the world , love for the Father [ d ] is not in them .
NIVUK	1%20John	2	16	For everything in the world – the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life – comes not from the Father but from the world .

NIVUK	1%20John	2	18	Dear children , this is the last hour ; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming , even now many antichrists have come . This is how we know it is the last hour .
NIVUK	1%20John	2	19	They went out from us , but they did not really belong to us . For if they had belonged to us , they would have remained with us ; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us .

NIVUK	1%20John	2	24	As for you , see that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you . If it does , you also will remain in the Son and in the Father .

NIVUK	1%20John	3	4	Everyone who sins breaks the law ; in fact , sin is lawlessness .
NIVUK	1%20John	3	5	But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins . And in him is no sin .
NIVUK	1%20John	3	6	No one who lives in him keeps on sinning . No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him .
NIVUK	1%20John	3	7	Dear children , do not let anyone lead you astray . The one who does what is right is righteous , just as he is righteous .
NIVUK	1%20John	3	8	The one who does what is sinful is of the devil , because the devil has been sinning from the beginning . The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil ’ s work .
NIVUK	1%20John	3	9	No one who is born of God will continue to sin , because God ’ s seed remains in them ; they can not go on sinning , because they have been born of God .
NIVUK	1%20John	3	10	This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are : anyone who does not do what is right is not God ’ s child , nor is anyone who does not love their brother and sister . More on love and hatred
NIVUK	1%20John	3	11	For this is the message you heard from the beginning : we should love one another .
NIVUK	1%20John	3	12	Do not be like Cain , who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother . And why did he murder him ? Because his own actions were evil and his brother ’ s were righteous .

NIVUK	1%20John	4	4	You , dear children , are from God and have overcome them , because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world .
NIVUK	1%20John	4	2	This is how you can recognise the Spirit of God : every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God ,
NIVUK	1%20John	4	3	but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God . This is the spirit of the antichrist , which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world .
NIVUK	1%20John	4	5	They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world , and the world listens to them .
NIVUK	1%20John	4	6	We are from God , and whoever knows God listens to us ; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us . This is how we recognise the Spirit [ a ] of truth and the spirit of falsehood . God ’ s love and ours
NIVUK	1%20John	4	7	Dear friends , let us love one another , for love comes from God . Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God .
NIVUK	1%20John	4	8	Whoever does not love does not know God , because God is love .
NIVUK	1%20John	4	9	This is how God showed his love among us : he sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him .
NIVUK	1%20John	4	10	This is love : not that we loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins .
NIVUK	1%20John	4	11	Dear friends , since God so loved us , we also ought to love one another .
NIVUK	1%20John	4	12	No one has ever seen God ; but if we love one another , God lives in us and his love is made complete in us .
NIVUK	1%20John	4	13	This is how we know that we live in him and he in us : he has given us of his Spirit .
NIVUK	1%20John	4	14	And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world .
NIVUK	1%20John	4	15	If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God , God lives in them and they in God .
NIVUK	1%20John	4	16	And so we know and rely on the love God has for us . God is love . Whoever lives in love lives in God , and God in them .
NIVUK	1%20John	4	17	This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment : in this world we are like Jesus .
NIVUK	1%20John	4	18	There is no fear in love . But perfect love drives out fear , because fear has to do with punishment . The one who fears is not made perfect in love .
NIVUK	1%20John	4	19	We love because he first loved us .
NIVUK	1%20John	4	20	Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar . For whoever does not love their brother and sister , whom they have seen , can not love God , whom they have not seen .
NIVUK	1%20John	4	21	And he has given us this command : anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister . Footnotes -

NIVUK	1%20John	5	16	If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death , you should pray and God will give them life . I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death . There is a sin that leads to death . I am not saying that you should pray about that .
NIVUK	1%20John	5	17	All wrongdoing is sin , and there is sin that does not lead to death .
NIVUK	1%20John	5	18	We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin ; the One who was born of God keeps them safe , and the evil one can not harm them .
NIVUK	1%20John	5	19	We know that we are children of God , and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one .
NIVUK	1%20John	5	20	We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding , so that we may know him who is true . And we are in him who is true by being in his Son Jesus Christ . He is the true God and eternal life .

NIVUK	2%20John	1	1	The elder , To the lady chosen by God and to her children , whom I love in the truth – and not I only , but also all who know the truth –
NIVUK	2%20John	1	3	Grace , mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ , the Father ’ s Son , will be with us in truth and love .
NIVUK	2%20John	1	4	It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth , just as the Father commanded us .
NIVUK	2%20John	1	5	And now , dear lady , I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning . I ask that we love one another .
NIVUK	2%20John	1	6	And this is love : that we walk in obedience to his commands . As you have heard from the beginning , his command is that you walk in love .
NIVUK	2%20John	1	7	I say this because many deceivers , who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh , have gone out into the world . Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist .
NIVUK	2%20John	1	8	Watch out that you do not lose what we [ a ] have worked for , but that you may be rewarded fully .
NIVUK	2%20John	1	9	Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God ; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son .

NIVUK	2%20John	1	11	Anyone who welcomes them shares in their wicked work .

NIVUK	3%20John	1	4	I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth .
NIVUK	3%20John	1	5	Dear friend , you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers and sisters , [ a ] even though they are strangers to you .
NIVUK	3%20John	1	6	They have told the church about your love . Please send them on their way in a manner that honours God .
NIVUK	3%20John	1	7	It was for the sake of the Name that they went out , receiving no help from the pagans .
NIVUK	3%20John	1	8	We ought therefore to show hospitality to such people so that we may work together for the truth .
NIVUK	3%20John	1	9	I wrote to the church , but Diotrephes , who loves to be first , will not welcome us .
NIVUK	3%20John	1	10	So when I come , I will call attention to what he is doing , spreading malicious nonsense about us . Not satisfied with that , he even refuses to welcome other believers . He also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the church .

NIVUK	Jude	1	1	Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James , To those who have been called , who are loved in God the Father and kept for [ a ] Jesus Christ :
NIVUK	Jude	1	2	Mercy , peace and love be yours in abundance . The sin and doom of ungodly people
NIVUK	Jude	1	3	Dear friends , although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share , I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to God ’ s holy people .
NIVUK	Jude	1	4	For certain individuals whose condemnation was written about [ b ] long ago have secretly slipped in among you . They are ungodly people , who pervert the grace of our God into a licence for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord .
NIVUK	Jude	1	5	Though you already know all this , I want to remind you that the Lord [ c ] at one time delivered his people out of Egypt , but later destroyed those who did not believe .
NIVUK	Jude	1	6	And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling – these he has kept in darkness , bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day .
NIVUK	Jude	1	7	In a similar way , Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion . They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire .
NIVUK	Jude	1	8	In the very same way , on the strength of their dreams these ungodly people pollute their own bodies , reject authority and heap abuse on celestial beings .
NIVUK	Jude	1	9	But even the archangel Michael , when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses , did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said , ‘ The Lord rebuke you ! ’ [ d ]
NIVUK	Jude	1	10	Yet these people slander whatever they do not understand , and the very things they do understand by instinct – as irrational animals do – will destroy them .
NIVUK	Jude	1	11	Woe to them ! They have taken the way of Cain ; they have rushed for profit into Balaam ’ s error ; they have been destroyed in Korah ’ s rebellion .
NIVUK	Jude	1	12	These people are blemishes at your love feasts , eating with you without the slightest qualm – shepherds who feed only themselves . They are clouds without rain , blown along by the wind ; autumn trees , without fruit and uprooted – twice dead .
NIVUK	Jude	1	13	They are wild waves of the sea , foaming up their shame ; wandering stars , for whom blackest darkness has been reserved for ever .
NIVUK	Jude	1	14	Enoch , the seventh from Adam , prophesied about them : ‘ See , the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones
NIVUK	Jude	1	15	to judge everyone , and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts they have committed in their ungodliness , and of all the defiant words ungodly sinners have spoken against him. ’ [ e ]
NIVUK	Jude	1	16	These people are grumblers and fault-finders ; they follow their own evil desires ; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage . A call to persevere
NIVUK	Jude	1	17	But , dear friends , remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold .
NIVUK	Jude	1	18	They said to you , ‘ In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires. ’
NIVUK	Jude	1	19	These are the people who divide you , who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit .
NIVUK	Jude	1	20	But you , dear friends , by building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit ,
NIVUK	Jude	1	21	keep yourselves in God ’ s love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life .
NIVUK	Jude	1	22	Be merciful to those who doubt ;
NIVUK	Jude	1	23	save others by snatching them from the fire ; to others show mercy , mixed with fear – hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh . [ f ] Doxology
NIVUK	Jude	1	24	To him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy –
NIVUK	Jude	1	25	to the only God our Saviour be glory , majesty , power and authority , through Jesus Christ our Lord , before all ages , now and for evermore ! Amen .

NIVUK	Revelation	1	11	which said : ‘ Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches : to Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia and Laodicea. ’
NIVUK	Revelation	1	12	I turned round to see the voice that was speaking to me . And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands ,
NIVUK	Revelation	1	13	and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man , [ d ] dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash round his chest .
NIVUK	Revelation	1	14	The hair on his head was white like wool , as white as snow , and his eyes were like blazing fire .
NIVUK	Revelation	1	15	His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace , and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters .
NIVUK	Revelation	1	16	In his right hand he held seven stars , and coming out of his mouth was a sharp , double-edged sword . His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance .
NIVUK	Revelation	1	17	When I saw him , I fell at his feet as though dead . Then he placed his right hand on me and said : ‘ Do not be afraid . I am the First and the Last .
NIVUK	Revelation	1	18	I am the Living One ; I was dead , and now look , I am alive for ever and ever ! And I hold the keys of death and Hades .
NIVUK	Revelation	1	19	‘ Write , therefore , what you have seen , what is now and what will take place later .

NIVUK	Revelation	4	2	At once I was in the Spirit , and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it .
NIVUK	Revelation	4	3	And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby . A rainbow that shone like an emerald encircled the throne .

NIVUK	Revelation	5	3	But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it .
NIVUK	Revelation	5	4	I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside .
NIVUK	Revelation	5	6	Then I saw a Lamb , looking as if it had been slain , standing at the centre of the throne , encircled by the four living creatures and the elders . The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits [ a ] of God sent out into all the earth .
NIVUK	Revelation	5	7	He went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne .
NIVUK	Revelation	5	8	And when he had taken it , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb . Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense , which are the prayers of God ’ s people .

NIVUK	Revelation	6	8	I looked , and there before me was a pale horse ! Its rider was named Death , and Hades was following close behind him . They were given power over a quarter of the earth to kill by sword , famine and plague , and by the wild beasts of the earth .
NIVUK	Revelation	6	9	When he opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained .
NIVUK	Revelation	6	10	They called out in a loud voice , ‘ How long , Sovereign Lord , holy and true , until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood ? ’
NIVUK	Revelation	6	11	Then each of them was given a white robe , and they were told to wait a little longer , until the full number of their fellow servants , their brothers and sisters , [ c ] were killed just as they had been .

NIVUK	Revelation	6	13	and the stars in the sky fell to earth , as figs drop from a fig-tree when shaken by a strong wind .
NIVUK	Revelation	6	14	The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up , and every mountain and island was removed from its place .
NIVUK	Revelation	6	15	Then the kings of the earth , the princes , the generals , the rich , the mighty , and everyone else , both slave and free , hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains .
NIVUK	Revelation	6	16	They called to the mountains and the rocks , ‘ Fall on us and hide us [ d ] from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb !

NIVUK	Revelation	7	2	Then I saw another angel coming up from the east , having the seal of the living God . He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea :
NIVUK	Revelation	7	3	‘ Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God. ’

NIVUK	Revelation	7	9	After this I looked , and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count , from every nation , tribe , people and language , standing before the throne and before the Lamb . They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands .
NIVUK	Revelation	7	10	And they cried out in a loud voice : ‘ Salvation belongs to our God , who sits on the throne , and to the Lamb. ’
NIVUK	Revelation	7	11	All the angels were standing round the throne and round the elders and the four living creatures . They fell down on their faces before the throne and worshipped God ,
NIVUK	Revelation	7	12	saying : ‘ Amen ! Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honour and power and strength be to our God for ever and ever . Amen ! ’
NIVUK	Revelation	7	13	Then one of the elders asked me , ‘ These in white robes – who are they , and where did they come from ? ’

NIVUK	Revelation	8	8	The second angel sounded his trumpet , and something like a huge mountain , all ablaze , was thrown into the sea . A third of the sea turned into blood ,
NIVUK	Revelation	8	2	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and seven trumpets were given to them .
NIVUK	Revelation	8	3	Another angel , who had a golden censer , came and stood at the altar . He was given much incense to offer , with the prayers of all God ’ s people , on the golden altar in front of the throne .
NIVUK	Revelation	8	4	The smoke of the incense , together with the prayers of God ’ s people , went up before God from the angel ’ s hand .
NIVUK	Revelation	8	5	Then the angel took the censer , filled it with fire from the altar , and hurled it on the earth ; and there came peals of thunder , rumblings , flashes of lightning and an earthquake . The trumpets
NIVUK	Revelation	8	6	Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them .
NIVUK	Revelation	8	7	The first angel sounded his trumpet , and there came hail and fire mixed with blood , and it was hurled down on the earth . A third of the earth was burned up , a third of the trees were burned up , and all the green grass was burned up .
NIVUK	Revelation	8	9	a third of the living creatures in the sea died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
NIVUK	Revelation	8	10	The third angel sounded his trumpet , and a great star , blazing like a torch , fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water –
NIVUK	Revelation	8	11	the name of the star is Wormwood . [ a ] A third of the waters turned bitter , and many people died from the waters that had become bitter .
NIVUK	Revelation	8	12	The fourth angel sounded his trumpet , and a third of the sun was struck , a third of the moon , and a third of the stars , so that a third of them turned dark . A third of the day was without light , and also a third of the night .
NIVUK	Revelation	8	13	As I watched , I heard an eagle that was flying in mid-air call out in a loud voice : ‘ Woe ! Woe !

NIVUK	Revelation	9	9	They had breastplates like breastplates of iron , and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle .
NIVUK	Revelation	9	2	When he opened the Abyss , smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace . The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss .
NIVUK	Revelation	9	3	And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth .
NIVUK	Revelation	9	4	They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree , but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads .
NIVUK	Revelation	9	5	They were not allowed to kill them but only to torture them for five months . And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes .
NIVUK	Revelation	9	6	During those days people will seek death but will not find it ; they will long to die , but death will elude them .
NIVUK	Revelation	9	7	The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle . On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold , and their faces resembled human faces .
NIVUK	Revelation	9	8	Their hair was like women ’ s hair , and their teeth were like lions ’ teeth .
NIVUK	Revelation	9	10	They had tails with stings , like scorpions , and in their tails they had power to torment people for five months .
NIVUK	Revelation	9	11	They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss , whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon ( that is , Destroyer ) .
NIVUK	Revelation	9	12	The first woe is past ; two other woes are yet to come .
NIVUK	Revelation	9	13	The sixth angel sounded his trumpet , and I heard a voice coming from the four horns of the golden altar that is before God .
NIVUK	Revelation	9	14	It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , ‘ Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates. ’
NIVUK	Revelation	9	15	And the four angels who had been kept ready for this very hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind .
NIVUK	Revelation	9	16	The number of the mounted troops was twice ten thousand times ten thousand . I heard their number .
NIVUK	Revelation	9	17	The horses and riders I saw in my vision looked like this : their breastplates were fiery red , dark blue , and yellow as sulphur . The heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions , and out of their mouths came fire , smoke and sulphur .
NIVUK	Revelation	9	18	A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire , smoke and sulphur that came out of their mouths .
NIVUK	Revelation	9	19	The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails ; for their tails were like snakes , having heads with which they inflict injury .
NIVUK	Revelation	9	20	The rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the work of their hands ; they did not stop worshipping demons , and idols of gold , silver , bronze , stone and wood – idols that can not see or hear or walk .

NIVUK	Revelation	10	10	I took the little scroll from the angel ’ s hand and ate it . It tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth , but when I had eaten it , my stomach turned sour .
NIVUK	Revelation	10	2	He was holding a little scroll , which lay open in his hand . He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land ,
NIVUK	Revelation	10	3	and he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion . When he shouted , the voices of the seven thunders spoke .
NIVUK	Revelation	10	4	And when the seven thunders spoke , I was about to write ; but I heard a voice from heaven say , ‘ Seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down. ’
NIVUK	Revelation	10	5	Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven .
NIVUK	Revelation	10	6	And he swore by him who lives for ever and ever , who created the heavens and all that is in them , the earth and all that is in it , and the sea and all that is in it , and said , ‘ There will be no more delay !

NIVUK	Revelation	10	9	So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll . He said to me , ‘ Take it and eat it . It will turn your stomach sour , but “ in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey. ” [ a ] ’

NIVUK	Revelation	11	11	But after the three and a half days the breath [ b ] of life from God entered them , and they stood on their feet , and terror struck those who saw them .
NIVUK	Revelation	11	2	But exclude the outer court ; do not measure it , because it has been given to the Gentiles . They will trample on the holy city for
NIVUK	Revelation	11	42	months .
NIVUK	Revelation	11	3	And I will appoint my two witnesses , and they will prophesy for 1,260 days , clothed in sackcloth. ’
NIVUK	Revelation	11	4	They are ‘ the two olive trees ’ and the two lampstands , and ‘ they stand before the Lord of the earth. ’ [ a ]
NIVUK	Revelation	11	5	If anyone tries to harm them , fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies . This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die .
NIVUK	Revelation	11	6	They have power to shut up the heavens so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying ; and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want .
NIVUK	Revelation	11	7	Now when they have finished their testimony , the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them , and overpower and kill them .
NIVUK	Revelation	11	8	Their bodies will lie in the public square of the great city – which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt – where also their Lord was crucified .
NIVUK	Revelation	11	9	For three and a half days some from every people , tribe , language and nation will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial .
NIVUK	Revelation	11	10	The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts , because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth .
NIVUK	Revelation	11	12	Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them , ‘ Come up here. ’ And they went up to heaven in a cloud , while their enemies looked on .
NIVUK	Revelation	11	13	At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed . Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake , and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven .
NIVUK	Revelation	11	14	The second woe has passed ; the third woe is coming soon . The seventh trumpet
NIVUK	Revelation	11	15	The seventh angel sounded his trumpet , and there were loud voices in heaven , which said : ‘ The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah , and he will reign for ever and ever. ’
NIVUK	Revelation	11	16	And the twenty-four elders , who were seated on their thrones before God , fell on their faces and worshipped God ,
NIVUK	Revelation	11	17	saying : ‘ We give thanks to you , Lord God Almighty , the One who is and who was , because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign .
NIVUK	Revelation	11	18	The nations were angry , and your wrath has come . The time has come for judging the dead , and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your people who revere your name , both great and small – and for destroying those who destroy the earth. ’
NIVUK	Revelation	11	19	Then God ’ s temple in heaven was opened , and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant . And there came flashes of lightning , rumblings , peals of thunder , an earthquake and a severe hailstorm .

NIVUK	Revelation	12	12	Therefore rejoice , you heavens and you who dwell in them ! But woe to the earth and the sea , because the devil has gone down to you ! He is filled with fury , because he knows that his time is short. ’
NIVUK	Revelation	12	2	She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth .
NIVUK	Revelation	12	3	Then another sign appeared in heaven : an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads .
NIVUK	Revelation	12	4	Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth . The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth , so that it might devour her child the moment he was born .
NIVUK	Revelation	12	5	She gave birth to a son , a male child , who ‘ will rule all the nations with an iron sceptre. ’ [ a ] And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne .
NIVUK	Revelation	12	6	The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for her by God , where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days .
NIVUK	Revelation	12	7	Then war broke out in heaven . Michael and his angels fought against the dragon , and the dragon and his angels fought back .
NIVUK	Revelation	12	8	But he was not strong enough , and they lost their place in heaven .
NIVUK	Revelation	12	9	The great dragon was hurled down – that ancient snake called the devil , or Satan , who leads the whole world astray . He was hurled to the earth , and his angels with him .
NIVUK	Revelation	12	10	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say : ‘ Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God , and the authority of his Messiah . For the accuser of our brothers and sisters , who accuses them before our God day and night , has been hurled down .
NIVUK	Revelation	12	11	They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony ; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death .
NIVUK	Revelation	12	13	When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth , he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child .
NIVUK	Revelation	12	14	The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle , so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness , where she would be taken care of for a time , times and half a time , out of the snake ’ s reach .
NIVUK	Revelation	12	15	Then from his mouth the snake spewed water like a river , to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent .
NIVUK	Revelation	12	16	But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth .
NIVUK	Revelation	12	17	Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring – those who keep God ’ s commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus .

NIVUK	Revelation	13	13	And it performed great signs , even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people .
NIVUK	Revelation	13	2	The beast I saw resembled a leopard , but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion . The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority .
NIVUK	Revelation	13	3	One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound , but the fatal wound had been healed . The whole world was filled with wonder and followed the beast .
NIVUK	Revelation	13	4	People worshipped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast , and they also worshipped the beast and asked , ‘ Who is like the beast ? Who can wage war against it ? ’
NIVUK	Revelation	13	5	The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise its authority for forty-two months .
NIVUK	Revelation	13	6	It opened its mouth to blaspheme God , and to slander his name and his dwelling-place and those who live in heaven .
NIVUK	Revelation	13	7	It was given power to wage war against God ’ s holy people and to conquer them . And it was given authority over every tribe , people , language and nation .
NIVUK	Revelation	13	8	All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast – all whose names have not been written in the Lamb ’ s book of life , the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world . [ b ]

NIVUK	Revelation	13	11	Then I saw a second beast , coming out of the earth . It had two horns like a lamb , but it spoke like a dragon .
NIVUK	Revelation	13	12	It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf , and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast , whose fatal wound had been healed .
NIVUK	Revelation	13	14	Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast , it deceived the inhabitants of the earth . It ordered them to set up an image in honour of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived .
NIVUK	Revelation	13	15	The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast , so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed .
NIVUK	Revelation	13	16	It also forced all people , great and small , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads ,
NIVUK	Revelation	13	17	so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark , which is the name of the beast or the number of its name .
NIVUK	Revelation	13	18	This calls for wisdom . Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man . [ e ] That number is

NIVUK	Revelation	14	14	I looked , and there before me was a white cloud , and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man [ b ] with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand .
NIVUK	Revelation	14	2	And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder . The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps .
NIVUK	Revelation	14	3	And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders . No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth .
NIVUK	Revelation	14	4	These are those who did not defile themselves with women , for they remained virgins . They follow the Lamb wherever he goes . They were purchased from among mankind and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb .
NIVUK	Revelation	14	5	No lie was found in their mouths ; they are blameless . The three angels
NIVUK	Revelation	14	6	Then I saw another angel flying in mid-air , and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth – to every nation , tribe , language and people .
NIVUK	Revelation	14	7	He said in a loud voice , ‘ Fear God and give him glory , because the hour of his judgment has come . Worship him who made the heavens , the earth , the sea and the springs of water. ’
NIVUK	Revelation	14	8	A second angel followed and said , ‘ “ Fallen ! Fallen is Babylon the Great , ” [ a ] which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries. ’
NIVUK	Revelation	14	9	A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice : ‘ If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on their forehead or on their hand ,
NIVUK	Revelation	14	10	they , too , will drink the wine of God ’ s fury , which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath . They will be tormented with burning sulphur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb .
NIVUK	Revelation	14	11	And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever . There will be no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image , or for anyone who receives the mark of its name. ’
NIVUK	Revelation	14	12	This calls for patient endurance on the part of the people of God who keep his commands and remain faithful to Jesus .
NIVUK	Revelation	14	13	Then I heard a voice from heaven say , ‘ Write this : blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. ’ ‘ Yes , ’ says the Spirit , ‘ they will rest from their labour , for their deeds will follow them. ’ Harvesting the earth and trampling the winepress
NIVUK	Revelation	14	15	Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud , ‘ Take your sickle and reap , because the time to reap has come , for the harvest of the earth is ripe. ’
NIVUK	Revelation	14	16	So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth , and the earth was harvested .
NIVUK	Revelation	14	17	Another angel came out of the temple in heaven , and he too had a sharp sickle .
NIVUK	Revelation	14	18	Still another angel , who had charge of the fire , came from the altar and called in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle , ‘ Take your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth ’ s vine , because its grapes are ripe. ’
NIVUK	Revelation	14	19	The angel swung his sickle on the earth , gathered its grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God ’ s wrath .
NIVUK	Revelation	14	20	They were trampled in the winepress outside the city , and blood flowed out of the press , rising as high as the horses ’ bridles for a distance of 1,600 stadia .

NIVUK	Revelation	15	15	I saw in heaven another great and marvellous sign : seven angels with the seven last plagues – last , because with them God ’ s wrath is completed .
NIVUK	Revelation	15	2	And I saw what looked like a sea of glass glowing with fire and , standing beside the sea , those who had been victorious over the beast and its image and over the number of its name . They held harps given them by God
NIVUK	Revelation	15	3	and sang the song of God ’ s servant Moses and of the Lamb : ‘ Great and marvellous are your deeds , Lord God Almighty . Just and true are your ways , King of the nations . [ a ]
NIVUK	Revelation	15	4	Who will not fear you , Lord , and bring glory to your name ? For you alone are holy . All nations will come and worship before you , for your righteous acts have been revealed. ’ [ b ]
NIVUK	Revelation	15	5	After this I looked , and I saw in heaven the temple – that is , the tabernacle of the covenant law – and it was opened .
NIVUK	Revelation	15	6	Out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues . They were dressed in clean , shining linen and wore golden sashes round their chests .
NIVUK	Revelation	15	7	Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God , who lives for ever and ever .

NIVUK	Revelation	17	2	With her the kings of the earth committed adultery , and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries. ’
NIVUK	Revelation	17	3	Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a desert . There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns .

NIVUK	Revelation	17	5	The name written on her forehead was a mystery : babylon the great the mother of prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth .
NIVUK	Revelation	17	6	I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God ’ s holy people , the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus . When I saw her , I was greatly astonished .
NIVUK	Revelation	17	7	Then the angel said to me : ‘ Why are you astonished ? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides , which has the seven heads and ten horns .

NIVUK	Revelation	18	13	cargoes of cinnamon and spice , of incense , myrrh and frankincense , of wine and olive oil , of fine flour and wheat ; cattle and sheep ; horses and carriages ; and human beings sold as slaves .

NIVUK	Revelation	18	15	The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off , terrified at her torment . They will weep and mourn
NIVUK	Revelation	18	16	and cry out : ‘ “ Woe ! Woe to you , great city , dressed in fine linen , purple and scarlet , and glittering with gold , precious stones and pearls !

NIVUK	Revelation	20	2	He seized the dragon , that ancient snake , who is the devil , or Satan , and bound him for a thousand years .
NIVUK	Revelation	20	3	He threw him into the Abyss , and locked and sealed it over him , to keep him from deceiving the nations any more until the thousand years were ended . After that , he must be set free for a short time .
NIVUK	Revelation	20	4	I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge .
